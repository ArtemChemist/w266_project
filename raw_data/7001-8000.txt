To study this peptide, we have raised mAbs against its C-terminal part. Using an immunoaffinity mass spectrometry approach, a whole family of N-terminally extended peptides in addition to RVD-Hp alpha were identified in rodent brain extracts and human and mouse plasma. We designated these peptides Pepcan-12 (RVDPVNFKLLSH) to Pepcan-23 (SALSDLHAHKLRVDPVNFKLLSH), referring to peptide length. The most abundant Pepcans found in the brain were tested for CB1 receptor binding. In the classical radioligand displacement assay, Pepcan-12 was the most efficacious ligand but only partially displaced both [H-3] CP55,940 and [H-3] WIN55,212-2. The data were fitted with the allosteric ternary complex model, revealing a cooperativity factor value alpha < 1, thus indicating a negative allosteric modulation. Dissociation kinetic studies of [3H] CP55,940 in the absence and presence of Pepcan-12 confirmed these results by showing increased dissociation rate constants induced by Pepcan-12. A fluorescently labeled Pepcan-12 analog was synthesized to investigate the binding to CB1 receptors. Competition binding studies revealed K-t values of several Pepcans in the nanomolar range. Accordingly, using competitive ELISA, we found low nanomolar concentrations of Pepcans in human plasma and similar to 100 pmol/g in mouse brain. Surprisingly, Pepcan-12 exhibited potent negative allosteric modulation of the orthosteric agonist-induced cAMP accumulation, [S-35] GTP gamma S binding, and CB1 receptor internalization. Pepcans are the first endogenous allosteric modulators identified forCB(1) receptors. Given their abundance in the brain, Pepcans could play an important physiological role in modulating endocannabinoid signaling.

However, its exact mechanisms of action have not been fully elucidated. The modulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) has been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, in the present study, the effect of MB on the function of the cloned alpha(7) subunit of the human nAChR expressed in Xenopus oocytes was investigated using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. MB reversibly inhibited ACh (100 mu M)-induced currents in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 3.4 +/- 0.3 mu M. The effect of MB was not dependent on the membrane potential. MB did not affect the activity of endogenous Ca2+-dependent Cl- channels, since the inhibition by MB was unaltered in oocytes injected with the Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis (o-aminophenoxy) ethane-N, N, N', N'-tetraacetic acid and perfused with Ca2+-free bathing solution containing 1.8 mM Ba2+. MB decreased the maximal ACh-induced responses without significantly affecting ACh potency. Furthermore, specific binding of [I-125] alpha-bungarotoxin, a radioligand selective for the alpha(7) nAChR, was not altered by MB (10 mu M), indicating that MB acts as a noncompetitive antagonist on alpha(7) nAChRs. In hippocampal slices, whole-cell recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurons indicated that the increases in the frequency and amplitudes of the gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated spontaneous postsynaptic currents induced by bath application of 2 mM choline, a specific agonist for alpha(7) nAChRs, were abolished after 10 min application of 3 mu M MB. These results demonstrate that MB inhibits the function of human alpha(7) nAChRs expressed in Xenopus oocytes and of alpha(7) nAChR-mediated responses in rat hippocampal neurons.

In Vivo Assessment of Vesicular Monoamine Transporter Type 2 in Dementia With Lewy Bodies and Alzheimer Disease	ARCHIVES OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; CEREBRAL GLUCOSE-METABOLISM; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; CLINICAL-DIAGNOSIS; BODY DEMENTIA; FDG-PET; DOPAMINE; BINDING; TERMINALS; VMAT2	Objective: To assess the diagnostic potential of imaging striatal monoaminergic terminal integrity with the vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2) radioligand (18)F 9-fluropropyl-(+)-dihydrotetrabenazine ([(18)F] AV-133) and positron emission tomography to distinguish dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) from Alzheimer disease (AD). Design, Setting, and Participants: Nine patients with DLB, 10 patients with AD, 20 patients with Parkinson disease (PD), and 10 healthy age-matched control subjects underwent [(18)F] AV-133 positron emission tomography studies. VMAT2 density was calculated through normalized tissue uptake value ratios at 120 to 140 minutes postinjection using the primary visual cortex as the reference region. Main Outcome Measure: Comparison of the tissue ratio for [(18)F] AV-133 between the different clinical diagnostic groups. Results: Lower VMAT2 densities were observed in patients with DLB when compared with patients with AD especially in the posterior putamen (caudate: mean [SD], 1.24 [0.6] vs 2.83 [0.9]; P < .001; effect size=2.1; anterior putamen: mean [SD], 0.90 [0.5] vs 3.01[0.9]; P < .001; effect size=2.9; posterior putamen: mean [SD], 0.62 [0.5] vs 2.87 [0.8]; P < .001; effect size=3.4). Compared with healthy controls, [(18)F] AV-133 tissue ratios were significantly lower by 88% and 74% in the posterior putamen, 74% and 65% in the anterior putamen, and 53% and 51% in the caudate nucleus of patients with PD and DLB, respectively. In contrast to patients with PD and DLB, no reductions were observed in patients with AD. Conclusions: [(18)F] AV-133 allows assessment of nigrostriatal degeneration in Lewy body diseases. [(18)F] AV-133 can robustly detect reductions of dopaminergic nigrostriatal afferents in patients with DLB and assist in the differential diagnosis from AD.

Interaction of ibogaine with human α3β4-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in different conformational states	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY & CELL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors; Conformational states; Noncompetitive antagonists; Ibogaine; Phencyclidine	AFFINITY-CHROMATOGRAPHY; NONCOMPETITIVE INHIBITORS; NICOTINIC RECEPTORS; MOLECULAR-MECHANISMS; BINDING; DEXTROMETHORPHAN; ALPHA-4-BETA-2; ANTAGONISTS; BUPROPION; STRATEGY	The interaction of ibogaine and phencyclidine (PCP) with human (h) alpha 3 beta 4-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) in different conformational states was determined by functional and structural approaches including, radioligand binding assays, Ca2+ influx detections, and thermodynamic and kinetics measurements. The results established that (a) ibogaine inhibits (+/-)-epibatidine-induced Ca2+ influx in h alpha 3 beta 4 AChRs with similar to 9-fold higher potency than that for PCP, (b) [H-3]ibogaine binds to a single site in the 1106134 AChR ion channel with relatively high affinity (K-d = 0.46 +/- 0.06 mu M), and ibogaine inhibits [H-3]ibogaine binding to the desensitized h alpha 3 beta 4 AChR with slightly higher affinity compared to the resting AChR. This is explained by a slower dissociation rate from the desensitized ion channel compared to the resting ion channel, and (c) PCP inhibits [H-3]ibogaine binding to the h alpha 3 beta 4 AChR, suggesting overlapping sites. The experimental results correlate with the docking simulations suggesting that ibogaine and PCP interact with a binding domain located between the serine (position 6') and valine/phenylalanine (position 13') rings. This interaction is mediated mainly by van der Waals contacts, which is in agreement with the observed enthalpic contribution determined by non-linear chromatography. However, the calculated entropic contribution also indicates local conformational changes. Collectively our data suggest that ibogaine and PCP bind to overlapping sites located between the serine and valine/phenylalanine rings, to finally block the AChR ion channel, and in the case of ibogaine, to probably maintain the AChR in the desensitized state for longer time.

Blockade of neurokinin-3 receptors modulates dopamine-mediated behavioral hyperactivity	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						NK-3; D1; Cocaine; Striatum; SB 222200; CD-1 mice	TACHYKININ NK3 RECEPTOR; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; AGONIST SENKTIDE; GUINEA-PIG; RAT; COCAINE; RESPONSES; ANTAGONISTS; ACTIVATION; STRIATUM	Acute activation or blockade of neurokinin-3 (NK-3) receptors has been shown to alter dopamine-mediated function and behaviors, however long-term effects of NK-3 receptor blockade remain largely unknown. The present study investigated whether acute and repeated administration of the NK-3 receptor antagonist SB 222200 altered hyperactivity induced by cocaine, and examined its effects on dopamine D1 receptor density in the striatum. Adult male CD-1 mice received either vehicle or SB 222200 (2.5 or 5 mg/kg, s.c.) 30 min before a cocaine injection (20 mg/kg, i.p.) and behavioral responses were recorded. Mice that were administered SB 222200 had an attenuated stereotypic response to cocaine compared to vehicle treated mice. Mice were also injected once daily with either vehicle or SB 222200 (5 mg/kg, s.c.) for 5 days, and after a 7-day drug-free period they were challenged with either saline, cocaine or the dopamine D1 receptor agonist SKF 82958 (0.125 or 0.25 mg/kg, i.p.). Mice injected with SB 222200 had significantly enhanced hyperactivity when challenged with cocaine or a low dose of SKF 82958 (0.125 mg/kg, i.p.) compared to control mice. Brains of mice administered vehicle or SB 222200 for 5 days were harvested after a 7-day drug-free period for dopamine D1 receptor quantification by radioligand binding. [H-3] SCH 23390 homogenate binding studies showed a 19.7% increase in dopamine D1 receptor density in the striatum of SB 222200 treated mice. These data suggest that repeated blockade of NK-3 receptors enhances subsequent dopamine-mediated behaviors possibly resulting from dopamine D1 receptor up-regulation in the striatum.

The serotonergic receptors mainly implied in depression are 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors. Activation of 5HT(2) receptor induces platelet aggregation. Drugs with 5-HT1A receptor agonist and 5-HT2A receptor antagonist effects reduced the receptor-mediated platelet aggregation. There are only indirect data about 5-HT1A receptors presence in platelet membranes, thus our aims were to study the characteristics of the platelet membranes 5-HT1A binding sites of both healthy volunteers and patients with cardiac valve disease and ischemic cardiopathy. The bound of the 5-HT1A selective agonist H-3-80H-DPAT to the platelet membranes 5-HT1A binding sites of patients with cardiac valve disease and ischemic cardiopathy were compared with a control group of healthy voluntaries using radioligand binding methods. The patients with cardiovascular disease showed a reduction (-50.401%) (p < 0.01) of the H-3-80H-DPAT bound to the platelet membranes 5-HT1A receptors (1.652 +/- 0.79 fmol/mg protein) with respect to the control group (3.331 +/- 0.16 fmol/mg protein). H-3-80H-DPAT binding to human platelet membranes is saturable, of high affinity, and seems selective for 5-HT1A receptors, and similar to that described in animal brain and in other human cells. Patients with ischemic cardiopathy and cardiac valve disease showed a reduction of the 80H-DPAT bound to the platelet membranes. Taken together, these findings suggest that the 80H-DPAT bound to the human platelet membranes is modulated by modifications produced by cardiovascular disease conditions. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Identification of domains influencing assembly and ion channel properties in α7 nicotinic receptor and 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor subunit chimaeras	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						nicotinic receptor; 5-HT receptor; assembly; single-channel conductance	NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR; ALPHA-BUNGAROTOXIN RECEPTORS; LARGE CYTOPLASMIC LOOP; FUNCTIONAL EXPRESSION; TRANSMEMBRANE SEGMENT; 5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE TYPE-3; PHARMACOLOGICAL-PROPERTIES; SURFACE EXPRESSION; MAMMALIAN-CELLS; DELTA-SUBUNIT	Background and purpose: Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( nAChRs) and 5- hydroxytryptamine type 3 receptors (5-HT(3)Rs) are members of the superfamily of neurotransmitter- gated ion channels. Both contain five subunits which assemble to form either homomeric or heteromeric subunit complexes. With the aim of identifying the influence of subunit domains upon receptor assembly and function, a series of chimaeras have been constructed containing regions of the neuronal nAChR alpha 7 subunit and the 5-HT(3) receptor (3A) subunit. Experimental approach: A series of subunit chimaeras containing alpha 7 and 5-HT(3A) subunit domains have been constructed and expressed in cultured mammalian cells. Properties of the expressed receptors have been examined by means of radioligand binding, agonist- induced changes in intracellular calcium and patch- clamp electrophysiology. Key results: Subunit domains which influence properties such as rectification, desensitization and conductance have been identified. In addition, the influence of subunit domains upon subunit folding, receptor assembly and cell- surface expression has been identified. Co- expression studies with the nAChR- associated protein RIC- 3 revealed that, in contrast to the potentiating effect of RIC- 3 on alpha 7 nAChRs, RIC- 3 caused reduced levels of cell-surface expression of some alpha 7/ 5-HT(3A) chimaeras. Conclusions and implications: Evidence has been obtained which demonstrates that subunit transmembrane domains are critical for efficient subunit folding and assembly. In addition, functional characterization of subunit chimaeras revealed that both extracellular and cytoplasmic domains exert a dramatic and significant influence upon single- channel conductance. These data support a role for regions other than hydrophobic transmembrane domains in determining ion channel properties.

Comparison of opioid receptor binding in horse, guinea pig, and rat cerebral cortex and cerebellum	VETERINARY ANAESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA			English	Article						brain; equine; guinea pig; opioid receptor; rat	SPECIES-DIFFERENCES; LOCOMOTOR-ACTIVITY; AFFINITY PROFILES; MU; DELTA; KAPPA; BRAIN; MORPHINE; SITES; FENTANYL	To compare the density and binding characteristics of opioid receptor subtypes in horse, rat, and guinea pig cerebral cortex and cerebellum. Prospective receptor binding study. Whole brains were obtained from four neurologically normal adult horses during necropsy. Rat and guinea pig brains were obtained commercially. The cerebellum and cerebral cortex were dissected from each brain, and tissue homogenates prepared. A radioligand binding technique with the highly selective ligands [H-3]-DAMGO, [H-3]-U69593, and [H-3]-DPDPE was used to identify the mu- (mu), kappa- (kappa) and delta- (delta) opioid receptors, respectively. Competitive binding assays were performed with these ligands and varying concentrations of one of multiple unlabeled ligands. While there were marked species differences in relative densities of opioid receptors, all radioligands interacted with their binding sites with high, nanomolar affinity in both the cerebral cortex and cerebellum. In the horse cerebral cortex, the percentages of total opioid binding sites for the mu-, kappa- and delta-receptors were 71%, 14% and 15%, respectively. In the rat and guinea pig cerebral cortex, the corresponding values were 56% mu-, 4% kappa- and 40% delta-receptors, and 25% mu-, 37% kappa- and 38% delta-receptors, respectively. In horse and guinea pig cerebellum, the binding was 37% mu-, 59% kappa- and 4% delta-receptors, and 15% mu-, 76% kappa- and 10% delta-receptors, respectively. For competitive analysis, all competitors of the mu-, kappa- and delta-receptors completely displaced [H-3]-DAMGO, [H-3]-U69593, and [H-3]-DPDPE and had inhibitory constants in the nanomolar range. Horses used in this study had a greater density of mu-receptors in the cerebral cortex compared with rats and guinea pigs but without further characterization of the functional role of these receptors it is impossible to determine the clinical significance of these data.

Mechanisms responsible for the enhanced antinociceptive effects of μ-opioid receptor agonists in the rostral ventromedial medulla of male rats with persistent inflammatory pain	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							PRIMARY AFFERENT NEURONS; SPINAL DORSAL-HORN; SUPRASPINAL MU; UP-REGULATION; EXPRESSION; MORPHINE; CORD; BRAIN; HETERODIMERIZATION; OLIGOMERIZATION	This study investigated three possible mechanisms by which the antinociceptive effects of the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist [D-Ala(2), N-Me-Phe(4), Gly(5)-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO) and the mu-opioid receptor (DOR) agonist [D-Ala(2), Glu(4)]-deltorphin (deltorphin II) (DELT), microinjected into the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), are enhanced in rats with persistent inflammatory injury. Radioligand binding determined that neither the B-max nor the K-d values of [H-3] DAMGO differed in RVM membranes from rats that received an intraplantar injection of saline or complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) in one hindpaw 4 h, 4 days, or 2 weeks earlier. Likewise, neither the EC50 nor the Emax value for DAMGO-induced stimulation of guanosine 5'-O-(3-[35S]thio)triphosphate ([S-35] GTP gamma S) binding differed in the RVM of saline- or CFA-treated rats at any time point. Microinjection of fixed dose combinations of DAMGO and DELT in the RVM of naive rats indicated that these agonists interact synergistically to produce antinociception when DAMGO is present in equal or greater amounts than DELT and, additively, when DELT is the predominant component. Thus, unlike the periphery or spinal cord, potentiation of MOR-mediated antinociception does not entail an increase in MOR number, affinity, or coupling. Rather, the data are concordant with our proposal that potentiation results from a synergistic interaction of exogenous MOR agonist with DOR-preferring enkephalins whose levels are increased in CFA-treated rats (J Neurosci 21: 2536-2545, 2001). Virtually no specific [H-3] DELT binding nor stimulation of [S-3] GTP gamma S binding by DELT was obtained in RVM membranes from CFA- or saline- treated rats at any time point. The mechanisms responsible for the potentiation of DELT-mediated antinociception remain to be elucidated.

Similar to classic benzodiazepines (BZDs), zolpidem binds at the extracellular N-terminal alpha/gamma subunit interface of the GABA-A receptor (GABAR). However, zolpidem differs significantly from classic BZDs in chemical structure and neuropharmacological properties. Thus, classic BZDs and zolpidem are likely to have different requirements for high-affinity binding to GABARs. To date, three residues -gamma 2Met57, gamma 2Phe77, and gamma 2Met130 -have been identified as necessary for high-affinity zolpidem binding (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 94: 8824 -8829, 1997; Mol Pharmacol 52: 874 -881, 1997). In this study, we used radioligand binding techniques, gamma 2/alpha 1 chimeric subunits (chi), site-directed mutagenesis, and molecular modeling to identify additional gamma 2 subunit residues important for high-affinity zolpidem binding. Whereas alpha 1 beta 2 chi receptors containing only the first 161 amino-terminal residues of the gamma 2 subunit bind the classic BZD flunitrazepam with wild-type affinity, zolpidem affinity is decreased similar to 8-fold. By incrementally restoring gamma 2 subunit sequence, we identified a seven-amino acid stretch in the 2 subunit loop F region (amino acids 186-192) that is required to confer high-affinity zolpidem binding to GABARs. When mapped to a homology model, these seven amino acids make up part of loop F located at the alpha/gamma interface. Based on in silico zolpidem docking, three residues within loop F, gamma 2Glu189, gamma 2Thr193, and gamma 2Arg194, emerge as being important for stabilizing zolpidem in the BZD binding pocket and probably interact with other loop F residues to maintain the structural integrity of the BZD binding site.

We showed a high plasma level of CF6 in human hypertension. The present study focused on the identification and characterization of a receptor for CF6 and its post-receptor signaling pathway. Incubation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with an excess of free CF6 reduced by 50% the immunoreactivity for the antibody to beta-subunit of ATP synthase at the cell surface, but unaffected that for the alpha-subunit antibody. A significant displacement of radioligand was observed at 3 X 10(-9) through 10(-7) M unlabeled CF6, and the Kd was 7.6 nM. Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) at 10-7 M and beta-subunit antibody of I-125-CF6 by 81.3 +/- 9.7% and 32.0 +/- 2.0%, respectively, whereas the alpha-subunit antibody suppressed the binding CF6 by 81.3 9.7% and unaffected it. The hydrolysis activity of ATP to ADP was increased by 1.6-fold by CF6 at 10(-7) M, and efrapeptin at 10(-5), an inhibitor of ATP synthase, blocked it. CF6 at 10(-7) M decreased intracellular pH in 2,7'-bis(carboxyethyl-5 (6))-carboxyfluorescein-loaded HUVEC. Amyloride at 10(-4) M augmented the pH decrease in response to CF6, whereas , efrapeptin at 10(-5) M blocked it. Arachidonic acid release was suppressed by CF6, and it was reversed by efrapeptin at 10(-5) or beta-subunit antibody or ADP at 10(-7) M. The beta-subunit antibody suppressed coupling factor 6-induced increase in blood pressure. These indicate that membrane-bound ATP synthase functions as a receptor for CF6 and may have a previously unsuspected role in the genesis of hypertension by modulating the concentration of intracellular hydrogen.

Schizophrenics show deficient sensory gating and abnormalities in the number and regulation of nicotinic receptors. Prepulse inhibition (PPI) deficits exhibited by isolation-reared rats are thought to model the sensorimotor gating deficits seen in schizophrenia. Objective: To examine the role of nicotinic a7 receptors in the isolation-rearing rat model, we tested whether the selective alpha 7 receptor agonist (R)-N-(1-Azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl)(5-(2-pyridyl)thiophene-2-carboxamide) (compound A) could reverse isolation-rearing-induced PPI deficits, and investigated alpha 7 receptor RNA expression in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, cerebellum, nucleus accumbens and thalamus, and alpha 7 receptor protein expression in the hippocampus of isolation-and group-reared rats. Method: Rats reared in isolation or groups of five from weaning were tested in the PPI paradigm under conditions of variable inter-stimulus interval (ISI) (pulse=110 dB/50 ms; prepulse=75 dB/30 ms; ISI=30, 100 and 300 ms) 30 min following administration of compound A (3.2-10 mg/kg i.p.). a7 Receptor expression was measured by TaqMan RT-PCR (total RNA) and autoradiography (protein). Results: Isolation-rearing-induced PPI deficits were attenuated by both doses of compound A at 100-ms ISI and by 10 mg/kg at 300-ms ISI. Expression of alpha 7 receptor RNA and protein was unaltered in isolation-reared rats. Conclusion: Although altered a7 receptor expression may not underlie the phenotype of isolation-reared rats, the activation of these receptors may be of benefit in re-establishing efficient gating function.

Immunoglobulin A (IgA) tTG-Ab have been described as excellent diagnostic markers, but the Ig subclass distribution and the importance of isotype tTG-Ab have not yet been established. In this study, using newly developed isotype- and subclass-specific radioligand assays, we examined anti-tTG IgA1, IgA2, IgG1, IgG4 and IgE antibodies in 30 symptomatic, untreated patients with CD and 22 subjects suspected to suffer from silent CD (sCD). Among 30 patients with CD, 27 (90.0%) were positive for IgA1 tTG-Ab, whereas only 12 (40.0%) had autoantibodies of the IgA2 subclass (P < 0.001). IgG1, IgG4 and IgE tTG-Ab were detected in 17 (56.6%), 0 and 3 (10.0%) individuals, respectively. IgA1 was also the predominant anti-tTG subclass in patients with sCD (n = 20, 90.1%), followed by IgA2 antibodies (n = 7, 31.8%), IgG1 antibodies (n = 4, 18.2%), IgG4 antibodies (n = 1, 4.5%) and IgE antibodies (n = 1, 4.5%). The comparison between both groups revealed a significantly higher prevalence of IgG1 antibodies in patients with symptomatic CD (P < 0.01). In 10 of 11 subjects undergoing an intestinal biopsy, the diagnosis of an sCD was confirmed. In this subgroup, there was a positive association between the presence of IgA2 and IgG1 tTG-Ab and severe (Marsh 2-3) mucosal abnormalities. In conclusion, patients with symptomatic and sCD predominantly have IgA1 tTG-Ab. IgG1 tTG-Ab are associated with symptomatic disease and, when present in patients with sCD, are correlated with a severe mucosal destruction. These data suggest that tTG-Ab subclasses could reflect inflammatory events associated with epithelial destruction.

The whole frontal cortex, hippocampus, thalamus and hypothalamus were collected after euthanasia and plasma membrane fractions obtained by ultracentrifiagation. beta-AR and 5-HTR were measured by binding assays using specific radioligand [(-)[H-3]CGP 12177 and 5-hydroxy[H-3]-tryptamine trifluoroacetate, respectively]. A significant decrease in beta-AR levels was observed in the frontal cortex (P=0.001), hippocampus (P<0.0001), and thalamus (P<0.0001) of aggressive dogs compared to controls. As far as 5-HTR are concerned, two receptor subtypes were detected. The two subtypes were classified as low-affinity (5-HTR LA) and high-affinity (5-HTR HA) serotonergic receptors for [H-3]-hydroxytryptamine, on the basis of their affinity for [H-3]-hydroxytryptamine. 5-HTR LA significantly increased in the whole central nervous system (CNS) area of aggressive dogs (frontal cortex P=0.071; hippocampus P=0.0013; thalamus P<0.0001; hypothalamus P=0.0004); 5-HTR HA significantly increased only in the thalamus (P=0.0005) and hypothalamus (P=0.0002). Results suggest the possible role played by the catecholaminergic and serotonergic systems in canine aggressive behaviour. The understanding of the biological basis of canine aggression may enable the development of pharmacological treatments that would target specific neurotransmitter systems. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

We now report the catecholamine and serotonin transporter-mediated actions of (-)-BPAP. The effects of (-)-BPAP on inhibition of neurotransmitter uptake and radioligand binding were assessed using human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK 293 cells) expressing cDNA for the human dopamine transporter (hDAT), norepinephrine transporter (hNET), and serotonin transporter (hSERT). The IC50 values for the effects of (-)-BPAP on [H-3]dopamine, [H-3]norepinephrine, and [H-3]serotonin uptake were 42 +/- 9, 52 +/- 19, and 640 +/- 120 nM, respectively. The IC50 values for the effects of (-)-BPAP on [I-125] 3beta-(4-iodophenyl)tropane-2beta-carboxylic acid methyl ester ([I-125]RTI-55) binding to hDAT, hNET, and hSERT were 16 +/- 2, 211 +/- 61, and 638 +/- 63 nM, respectively. The effects of (-)-BPAP on spontaneous and tyramine-induced norepinephrine and dopamine release from rat brain synaptosomes using a superfusion system were also assessed. Tyramine but not (-)-BPAP potentiated norepinephrine release. Furthermore, (-)-BPAP inhibited tyramine-induced norepinephrine release. Thus, (-)-BPAP may block tyramine-induced adverse effects such as hypertensive crisis. The actions of (-)-BPAP on the spontaneous and tyramine-induced dopamine release resembled its effects on norepinephrine release. We conclude that (-)-BPAP is not only catecholaminergic and serotonergic activity enhancer, but also a norepinephrine and dopamine uptake inhibitor and a weak serotonin uptake inhibitor that does not possess a tyramine-like action on catecholamine release, and is an inhibitor of tyramine-induced release of norepinephrine.

The 5.24 receptor is a G-protein-coupled receptor that shares amino acid sequence identity to mammalian pheromone receptors, the calcium-sensing receptor, the T1R taste receptors, and the metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). It is most potently activated by the basic amino acids L-lysine and L-arginine. In this study we generated a homology model of the ligand binding domain of the 5.24 receptor based on the crystal structure of mGluR1 and examined the proposed lysine binding pocket using site-directed mutagenesis. Mutants of truncated glycosylated versions of the receptor containing only the extracellular domain were analyzed in a radioligand binding assay, whereas the analogous full-length membrane-bound mutants were studied using a fluorescence-based functional assay. In silico analysis predicted that aspartate 388 interacts with the terminal amino group on the side chain of the docked lysine molecule. This prediction was supported by experimental observations demonstrating that mutation of this residue caused a 26-fold reduction in the affinity for L-lysine but virtually no change in the affinity for the polar amino acid L-glutamine. In addition, mutations in four highly conserved residues ( threonine 175, tyrosine 223, and aspartates 195 and 309) predicted to establish interactions with the alpha amino group of the bound lysine ligand greatly reduced or eliminated binding and receptor activation. These results define the essential features of amino acid selectivity within the 5.24 receptor binding pocket and highlight an evolutionarily conserved motif required for ligand recognition in amino acid activated receptors in the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily.

Through novel mixed mode Monte Carlo/Stochastic Dynamics (MC/SD) calculations, we tested the importance of aromaticity at position 5.39(275) in CB1. MC/SD calculations were performed on wild-type (WT) CB1 and two mutants, Y5.39(275)F and Y5.39(275)I. Results indicated that while the CB1 Y5.39(275)F mutant is very similar to WT, the Y5.39(275)1 mutant shows pronounced topology changes in the TMH 3-4-5 region. Site-directed mutagenesis studies of tyrosine 5.39 to phenylalanine (Y --> F) or isoleucine (Y --> I) in both CB1 and CB2 were performed to determine the functional role of this amino acid in each receptor subtype. HEK 293 cells transfected with mutant receptor cDNAs were evaluated in radioligand binding and cyclic AMP assays. The CB1 mutant and WT receptors were also co-expressed with G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying channels (GIRK1 and GIRK4) in Xenopus oocytes to assess functional coupling. The Y --> F mutation resulted in cannnabinoid receptors with subtle differences in WT binding and signal transduction. In contrast, the Y --> I mutations produced receptors that could not produce signal transduction or bind to multiple cannabinoid compounds. However, immunofluorescence data indicate that the Y --> I mutation was compartmentalized and expressed at a level similar to that of the WT cannabinoid receptor. These results underscore the importance of aromaticity at position CB1 5.39(275) and CB2 5.39(191) for ligand recognition in the cannabinoid receptors. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

The new compounds and some of their related analogues, already reported, were tested in new multi-receptorial radioligand binding assays. As reference compounds, the known sigma (1) ligands SA 4503, ED 1008 and NE 100 were also prepared and tested. All reported compounds showed high sigma (1) affinity assayed by (+)-[H-3]-pentazocine on guinea-pig brain (apparent K-i = 1.75-72.2 nM) and moderate or low sigma (2) affinity by [H-3]-DTG on rat liver, in contrast with previous results. One tertiary amine function spaced by a five-membered chain from a phenyl group is the structural feature shared by the most active compounds 26 and 43 and some reference al ligands. The reported ol ligands, including reference compounds, also demonstrated a high affinity towards EBP (Delta (8)-Delta (7) sterol isomerase) site (apparent K-i = 0.48-14.8 nM) and some of them (37 and 44) were good ligands at L-type Ca++ channel. 1-14-(2,3-Dihydro- 1H-inden-1-yl)butyl]-3,3-dimethylpiperidine (26) was the best mixed sigma (1) and EBP ligand (apparent K-i = 1.75 and 1.54 nM, respectively) with a good selectivity versus sigma (2) receptor (138- and 157-fold, respectively).

Whereas methylphenidate blocks the dopamine transporter (main mechanism for removal of extracellular dopamine), it is unclear whether at doses used therapeutically it significantly changes extracellular dopamine (DA) concentration. Here we used positron emission tomography and [C-11] raclopride (D2 receptor radioligand that competes with endogenous DA for binding to the receptor) to evaluate whether oral methylphenidate changes extracellular DA in the human brain in 11 healthy controls. We showed that oral methylphenidate (average dose 0.8 +/- 0.11 mg/kg) significantly increased extracellular DA in brain, as evidenced by a significant reduction in B-max/K-d (measure of D2 receptor availability) in striatum (20 +/- 12%; p < 0.0005). These results provide direct evidence that oral methylphenidate at doses within the therapeutic range significantly increases extracellular DA in human brain. This result coupled with recent findings of increased dopamine transporters in ADHD patients (which is expected to result in reductions in extracellular DA) provides a mechanistic framework for the therapeutic efficacy of methylphenidate. The increase in DA caused by the blockade of dopamine transporters by methylphenidate predominantly reflects an amplification of spontaneously released DA, which in turn is responsive to environmental stimulation. Because DA decreases background firing rates and increases signal-to-noise in target neurons, we postulate that the amplification of weak DA signals in subjects with ADHD by methylphenidate would enhance task-specific signaling, improving attention and decreasing distractibility. Alternatively methylphenidate-induced increases in DA, a neurotransmitter involved with motivation and reward, could enhance the salience of the task facilitating the "interest that it elicits" and thus improving performance.

Radioligand binding and ribonuclease protection assays were performed with separate hemispheres of frontal cortex from each animal to examine concomitant changes in 5-HT2A receptor sites and mRNA levels. The decrease in cortical 5-HT2A receptor sites in response to chronic DOI administration was not accompanied by changes in 5-HT2A receptor mRNA. A single injection of DOI produced a transient decrease in 5-HT2A receptor mRNA levels detected 1 h postinjection. The density of 5-MT, receptor sites, however, was not significantly reduced following a single injection of DOI. The down-regulation of cortical 5-HT2A receptor sites in response to a single injection of mianserin was accompanied by reductions in 5-HT2A receptor mRNA levels. Following 4 days of mianserin administration, however, we did not observe a change in 5-HT2A receptor mRNA levels, although 5-HT2A receptor density was decreased. Thus, changes in receptor mRNA may initially contribute to the down-regulation of 5-HT2A receptors in response to acute mianserin administration. Sustained changes in 5-HT2A receptor mRNA, however, appear not to be involved in maintaining the down-regulation of 5-HT2A receptor number with chronic mianserin administration. Mechanisms other than the regulation of receptor mRNA levels appear to underlie the down-regulation of 5-MT, receptor sites in response to chronic administration of the agonist DOI.

W.T. Aiton, Hypoxis hemerocallidea Fisch. & C.A. Mey., and Leonotis leonurus. (L.) R.Br. have been recorded among different ethnic groups to be a valuable herbal remedy for the management of depression-related conditions. The current study investigated the affinity of these three plants toward the serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) and adenosine A(1)/A(2) receptors. Six solvents (water, methanol, acetone, dichloromethane, petroleum ether, and hexane) were used to extract the selected plants. We established that eight extracts exerted potential affinity based on the applied in vitro binding experiment. The methanol and acetone extracts of Hypoxis hemerocallidea had 60% specific binding of [H-3]citalopram, an indication that almost 40% of the plant extracts were bound to the SERT. For the adenosine receptor binding assays, methanol and hexane extracts of Leonotis leonurus were the most active, with rA(1)K(i) values of 0.038 and 0.176 mg/mL, respectively. In addition, the dichloromethane extract of Gomphocarpus fruticosus had an rA(1)K(i) value of 6.46 mg/mL. Extracts from the more polar solvents methanol and dichloromethane had higher binding affinity. Additionally, these plant extracts acted as antagonists at the adenosine A1 receptor. Overall, the current findings provide an indication of the potential antidepressant effects of some of the tested extracts based on their binding to the receptors evaluated. However, a combination of other in vitro assays is needed to establish possible mechanisms of action. In addition, computational analysis and profiling of plant extracts is crucial to identify the bioactive compounds with a higher affinity to the receptors. Ultimately, in vivo studies remain essential to allow for an in-depth elucidation of the mechanisms of action.

Objectives To evaluate the brain regional microglia activation and its relationship with clinical severity, dopaminergic presynaptic function, and peripheral inflammatory biomarkers related to adaptive immunity. Methods In this case-control study, we recruited 23 healthy participants and 24 participants with early-stage Parkinson's disease. F-18-PBR06 PET/MR for microglia activation, F-18-FP-DTBZ for dopaminergic denervation, total account of T cells and subpopulations of T helper (Th1/Th2/Th17) cells, and the levels of serum inflammatory cytokines were assessed. Sanger sequencing was used to exclude the mix-affinity binders of F-18-PBR06-PET. Results Compared to healthy controls, patients with Parkinson's disease had an increased F-18-PBR06-PET standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) in the putamen, particularly in the ipsilateral side of the motor onset. F-18-PBR06-PET SUVR was positively associated with F-18-FP-DTBZ-PET SUVR in the brainstem and not associated with disease severity measured by Hoehn and Yahr stage, MDS-UPDRS III scores. Patients with Parkinson's disease had elevated frequencies of Th1 cells and serum levels of IL10 and IL17A as compared to healthy controls. No significant association between peripheral inflammation markers and microglia activation in the brain of PD was observed. Conclusion Parkinson's disease is associated with early putaminal microglial activation and peripheral phenotypic Th1 bias. Peripheral adaptive immunity might be involved in microglia activation in the process of neurodegeneration in PD indirectly, which may be a potential biomarker for the early detection and the target for immunomodulating therapy.

Being able to accurately monitor biological changes underlying neuropathic pain will improve our understanding of neuropathic pain mechanisms and facilitate the development of novel therapeutics. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a noninvasive molecular imaging technique that can provide quantitative information of biochemical changes at the whole-body level by using radiolabeled ligands. One important biological change underlying the development of neuropathic pain is the overexpression of alpha 2 delta-1 subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels (the target of gabapentin). Thus, we hypothesized that a radiolabeled form of gabapentin may allow imaging changes in alpha 2 delta-1 for monitoring the underlying pathophysiology of neuropathic pain. Here, we report the development of two F-18-labeled derivatives of gabapentin (trans-4-[F-18]fluorogabapentin and cis-4-[F-18]fluorogabapentin) and their evaluation in healthy rats and a rat model of neuropathic pain (spinal nerve ligation model). Both isomers were found to selectively bind to the alpha 2 delta-1 receptor with trans-4-[F-18]fluorogabapentin having higher affinity. Both tracers displayed around 1.5-to 2-fold increased uptake in injured nerves over the contralateral uninjured nerves when measured by gamma counting ex vivo. Although the small size of the nerves and the signal from surrounding muscle prevented visualizing these changes using PET, this work demonstrates that fluorinated derivatives of gabapentin retain binding to alpha 2 delta-1 and that their radiolabeled forms can be used to detect pathological changes in vitro and ex vivo. Furthermore, this work confirms that alpha 2 delta-1 is a promising target for imaging specific features of neuropathic pain.

Classical agonists of this receptor, such as morphine, are the main targets in the treatment of both acute and chronic pain. However, the dangerous side effects, such as respiratory depression or addiction, significantly limit their widespread use. The allosteric centers of the receptors exhibit large structural diversity within particular types and even subtypes. Currently, a considerable interest is aroused by the modulation of mu-opioid receptors. The application of such a technique may result in a reduction in the dose or even discontinuation of classical opiates, thus eliminating the side effects typical of this class of drugs. Our aim is to obtain a series of 1-aryl-5,6(1H)dioxo-2,3-dihydroimidazo[1,2-a]imidazole derivatives and provide more information about their activity and selectivity on OP3 (MOP, human mu opioid receptor). The study was based on an observation that some carbonyl derivatives of 1-aryl-2-aminoimidazoline cooperate strongly with morphine or DAMGO in sub-threshold doses, producing similar results to those of normal active doses. To elucidate the possible mechanism of such enhancement, we performed a few in vitro functional tests (involving cAMP and beta-arrestin recruitment) and a radioligand binding assay on CHO-K1 cells with the expression of the OP3 receptor. One of the compounds had no orthosteric affinity or intrinsic activity, but inhibited the efficiency of DAMGO. These results allow to conclude that this compound is a negative allosteric modulator (NAM) of the human mu-opioid receptor.

Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the synthetic cannabinoid, 5F-MDMB-PICA, in male rats	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						5F-MDMB-PICA; Body temperature; Cannabinoid-1 receptor; Catalepsy; Forensic toxicology; Metabolites; Method validation; Quantitation; Synthetic cannabinoid	IN-VITRO; PHARMACOLOGY; METABOLITES; FUBINACA; JWH-018; DRUGS	5F-MDMB-PICA is a popular synthetic cannabinoid associated with analytically confirmed intoxications. In vitro studies show 5F-MDMB-PICA is a potent cannabinoid-1 receptor (CB1) agonist, but little information is available about in vivo pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. To this end, the present study had three aims: 1) to develop a validated method for detection of 5F-MDMB-PICA and its metabolites in rat plasma, 2) to utilize the method for investigating pharmacokinetics of 5F-MDMB-PICA in rats, and 3) to relate 5F-MDMB-PICA pharmacokinetics to pharmacodynamic effects. 5F-MDMB-PICA and its metabolites were quantified using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and method validation followed forensic standards. Male Sprague-Dawley rats bearing surgically implanted jugular catheters and subcutaneous (s.c.) temperature transponders received 5F-MDMB-PICA (50, 100, or 200 mu g/kg, s.c.) or its vehicle. Blood samples were drawn at 15, 30, 60, 120, 240, and 480 min post-injection, and plasma was assayed using LC-MS/MS. At each blood draw, body temperature, and catalepsy scores were recorded. Maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) of 5F-MDMBPICA rose linearly with increasing dose (1.72-6.20 ng/mL), and plasma half-life (t1/2) ranged from 400 to 1000 min 5F-MDMB-PICA-3,3-dimethylbutanoic acid and 5OH-MDMB-PICA were the only metabolites detected, and plasma concentrations were much lower than the parent drug. 5F-MDMB-PICA induced robust hypothermia and catalepsy-like symptoms that were significantly correlated with concentrations of 5F-MDMB-PICA. Radioligand binding in rat brain membranes revealed 5F-MDMB-PICA displays high affinity for CB1 (IC50 = 2 nM) while metabolites do not. In summary, 5F-MDMB-PICA is a potent CB1 agonist in rats whose pharmacodynamic effects are related to circulating concentrations of the parent drug and not its metabolites.

The present study aimed to elucidate the effects of mirabegron on muscarinic receptors in the rat bladder using radioligand binding and functional assays. Mirabegron (0.1-100 mu M) inhibited specific [N-methyl-H-3]scopolamine methyl chloride binding in the bladder and other tissues of rats in a concentration-dependent manner. Binding affinity in the bladder was similar to that in the heart and significantly higher than those in the submaxillary gland and brain. Mirabegron induced the concentration-dependent relaxation of carbachol-induced contractions in the rat isolated bladder. Further analyses using a two-site model revealed that the relative quantities of high- and low-affinity components for mirabegron were 44.5% and 55.5%, respectively. Respective pEC(50) values were 7.06 and 4.97. Based on the receptor binding affinity and pharmacokinetics of mirabegron, muscarinic receptor occupancy in the human bladder for 24 hours after the administration of a single oral dose of 50 mg mirabegron was 37%-76%. The present results demonstrate for the first time that mirabegron may relax the detrusor smooth muscle not only by beta(3)-adrenoceptor activation but also muscarinic receptor blockade. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Mirabegron, the first selective beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonist, represents an alternative to antimuscarinic agents for management of overactive bladder (OAB). The present study aimed to clarify whether mirabegron directly binds to muscarinic receptors and affects cholinergic agonist-induced contractions in rat urinary bladder and to predict muscarinic receptor occupancy in human bladder after oral administration of mirabegron. The results demonstrated that mirabegron therapy for patients with OAB may be due not only to b3-adrenoceptor activation but also muscarinic receptor blockade.

Unfortunately, current therapies often lead to the onset of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), causing significant mortality. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new and targeted therapies that are advantageous over the current ones. Recently, the PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy of mCRPC has shown very promising results. In line with this, we described the synthesis of a new radioimmunoconjugate,(223)RaA-silane-PEG-D2B, for targeted mCRPC therapy. The new compound consists of a NaA zeolite nanocarrier loaded with the alpha-particle emitting Ra-223 radionuclide, functionalized with the anti-PSMA D2B antibody. Physicochemical properties of the synthesized compound were characterized by standard methods (HR-SEM, TEM, XRD, FTIR, EDS, NTA, DLS, BET, TGA). The targeting selectivity, the extent of internalization, and cytotoxicity were determined in LNCaP C4-2 (PSMA+) and DU-145 (PSMA-) cells. Our results supported the(223)RaA-silane-PEG-D2B synthesis and revealed that the final product had a diameter ca. 120 nm and specific activity 0.65 MBq/1mg.

Optimization and pharmacological characterization of receptor-mediated G<sub>i/o</sub> activation in postmortem human prefrontal cortex	BASIC & CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY & TOXICOLOGY			English	Article						G protein; neurotransmitter; postmortem human brain; prefrontal cortex; receptor	BINDING ASSAY; G-PROTEINS; IN-VITRO; RADIOLIGAND; ANTAGONISTS; MEMBRANES; ALPHA-2A; POTENCY; AGONIST; ANALOGS	The biochemical abnormalities in transmembrane signal transduction mediated through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been postulated as underlying pathophysiology of psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia and mood disorders. In the present study, the experimental conditions of agonist-induced [S-35]GTP gamma S binding in postmortem human brain membranes were optimized, and the responses induced by a series of agonists were pharmacologically characterized. The [S-35]GTP gamma S binding assay was performed in postmortem human prefrontal cortical membranes by means of filtration techniques, and standardized as to GDP concentration, membrane protein content, MgCl2 and NaCl concentrations in assay buffer, incubation period and effect of white matter contamination. Under the standard assay conditions, the specific [S-35]GTP gamma S binding was stimulated by the addition of 15 compounds in a concentration-dependent manner. Of these agonists, R(+)-8-OH-DPAT, UK-14,304, DAMGO and DPDPE showed apparently biphasic concentration-response curves. As for these four responses, only higher-potency site was pharmacologically characterized. The receptors involved in the responses investigated were 5-HT1A receptor (probed with R(+)-8-OH-DPAT or 5-HT), alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor (UK-14,304 or (-)-epinephrine), M-2/M-4 mAChRs (carbachol), adenosine A(1) receptor (adenosine), histamine H-3 receptor (histamine), group II mGlu (l-glutamate), GABA(B) receptor (baclofen), mu-opioid receptor (DAMGO or endomophin-1), delta-opioid receptor (DPDPE or SNC-80) and NOP (nociceptin). Although dopamine also activated specific [S-35]GTP gamma S binding, this response was likely mediated via alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor, but not dopamine receptor subtypes. The present study provides us with fundamental aspects of the strategy for elucidation of probable abnormalities of neural signalling mediated by G proteins activated through multiple GPCRs in the brain of psychiatric patients.

Furthermore, PR expression can predict response to selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). Current immunohistochemical approaches to PR detection are limited by sampling error associated with biopsy and lack of standardised protocols; positron emission tomography (PET) using receptor targeted radiopharmaceuticals to provide quantitative, whole-body imaging may overcome these limitations. PR expression has been successfully imaged with PET in the clinical setting, however investigation into new radioligands with improved pharmacokinetics and metabolic stability is desirable.ResultsWe report the synthesis of a focused library of non-steroidal PR ligands evaluated for use as PET radioligands. A lead candidate ([F-18]2) with low nanomolar activity was selected and radiolabelled with a radiochemical yield of 2.292.31% (decay-corrected), radiochemical purity (RCP) >95% and a molar activity of 2.5 +/- 1.6GBq/mu mol. Cell uptake studies showed a significant and specific accumulation of [F-18]2 in T47D (PR++) breast cancer cell compared to MDA-MB-231 (PR-) control; however, in vivo evaluation was confounded by rapid defluorination of the radioligand. In vitro metabolite analysis of 2 in MLM confirmed defluorination and oxidative metabolism of the thiocarbamate to oxocarbamate moiety by mass spectrometry.ConclusionsA route to access [F-18]2 was developed to allow in vitro and in vivo evaluation, albeit with low radiochemical yield and modest molar activity. [F-18]2 demonstrated selective uptake in PR++ T47D cells which could be blocked in a dose dependent manner with progesterone. However, [F-18]2 showed poor in vivo metabolic stability with rapid defluorination within the time frame of the imaging protocol.

A recent report proposed that body image distortion (BID), a core symptom of AN, may relate to abnormalities of the serotonin system, especially the serotonin transporter (5HTT). Positron emission tomography (PET) studies of underweight patients with active AN reported alterations in serotonin receptors, but not 5HTT. Here, we aimed to disclose the clinicopathophysiology of AN by focusing on 5HTT and cognitive functions, including BID, in groups with active AN. Twenty-two underweight female patients with AN (12 restricting-type AN (ANR); 10 binge-eating/purging-type AN (ANBP)) and 20 age-matched healthy female subjects underwent PET with a 5HTT radioligand [C-11]DASB. The binding potential (BPND) of [C-11]DASB was estimated semiquantitatively, and clinical data from Raven's colored progressive matrices for general intelligence, the Stroop test for focused attention, the Iowa gambling task for decision making and a dot-probe task designed for BID were compared with the levels of BPND in different groups. [C-11]DASB BPND was significantly decreased in the medial parietal cortex in patients with AN and in the dorsal raphe in patients with ANR compared with healthy subjects (p < .05 corrected). Patients with ANR showed a significantly negative correlation between [C-11]DASB BPND in the dorsal raphe and performance on the dot-probe task (p < .05 corrected). While reduced 5HTT in the medial parietal cortex (the somatosensory association area) is pathophysiologically important in AN in general, additional 5HTT reduction in the dorsal raphe as seen in ANR is implicated for the clinicopathophysiological relevance.

Antagonism of both these adenosine receptors may offer therapeutic benefits in complex neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The aim of this study was to explore the affinity and selectivity of 2-benzylidene-1-tetralone derivatives as adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptor antagonists. Several 5-hydroxy substituted 2-benzylidene-1-tetralone analogues with substituents on ring B were synthesized and assessed as antagonists of the adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptors via radioligand binding assays. The results indicated that hydroxy substitution in the meta and para position of phenyl ring B, displayed the highest selectivity and affinity for the adenosine A(1) receptor with K-i values in the low micromolar range. Replacement of ring B with a 2-amino-pyrimidine moiety led to compound 12 with an increase of affinity and selectivity for the adenosine A(2A) receptor. These substitution patterns led to enhanced adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptor binding affinity. The para-substituted 5-hydroxy analogue 3 behaved as an adenosine A(1) receptor antagonists in a GTP shift assay performed with rat whole brain membranes expressing adenosine A(1) receptors. In conclusion, compounds 3 and 12, showed the best adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptor affinity respectively, and therefore represent novel adenosine receptor antagonists that may have potential with further structural modifications as drug candidates for neurological disorders.

Methods: Using cross-sectional positron emission tomography (PET) neuroimaging and structured clinical assessment, outpatients with mild to moderate AD (N = 24) and healthy older adults without cognitive complaints (C group; N = 22) were studied. PET imaging of alpha 4 beta 2* nicotinic cholinergic receptor binding using 2-[F-18]fluoro-3-(2(S)azetidinylmethoxy)pyridine (2FA) and clinical measures of global cognition, attention/processing speed, verbal memory, visuospatial memory, and neuropsychiatric symptoms were used. Results: 2FA binding was lower in the AD group compared with the C group in the medial thalamus, medial temporal cortex, anterior cingulate, insula/opercula, inferior caudate, and brainstem (p < 0.05, corrected cluster), but binding was not associated with cognition. The C group had significant inverse correlations between 2FA binding in the thalamus (left: r(s) = -0.55, p = 0.008; right: r(s) = -0.50, p = 0.02; N = 22) and hippocampus (left: r(s) = -0.65, p = 0.001; right: r(s) = -0.55, p = 0.009; N = 22) and the Trails A score. The AD group had inverse correlation between 2FA binding in anterior cingulate (left: r(s) = -0.50, p = 0.01; right: r(s) = -0.50, p = 0.01; N = 24) and Neurobehavioral Rating Scale agitation/disinhibition factor score. Conclusion: Cholinergic receptor binding is reduced in specific brain regions in mild to moderate AD and is related to neuropsychiatric symptoms. Among healthy older adults, lower receptor binding may be associated with slower processing speed. Cholinergic receptor binding in vivo may reveal links to other key brain changes associated with aging and AD and may provide a potential molecular treatment target.

Radioligand binding assays showed that all these prepared compounds displayed nanomolar affinity for angiotensin II type 1 receptor, among which compound 1f was more affinitive than telmisartan at the same order of magnitude with an IC50 value of 1.13 +/- 1.68 nM. The antihypertensive effects showed that all these compounds could decrease blood pressure in a dose dependent manner on spontaneously hypertensive rats. And compound 2-(4-((2-butyl-4-methyl-6-(oxazolo[4,5-b] pyridine2-yl) benzimidazole-1-yl) methyl)-1H-indol-1-yl) benzoic acid (1f), showed efficient and long-lasting effects in reducing blood pressure, with a maximal response lowered 55.98 +/- 4.74 mmHg at 10 mg kg(-1) and 35.82 +/- 6.20 mmHg at 5 mg kg(-1), the antihypertensive effect of it lasted beyond 24 h which was better than telmisartan. In the single-dose pharmacokinetic experiments, compound 1f was absorbed efficiently and metabolized smoothly in Wistar rats. The values of C-max, T-max, AUC(0-72), MRT0-72 and T-1/2 were 17.92 +/- 10.85 ng mL(-1), 2.60 +/- 3.05 h, 252.85 +/- 144.59 ng mL(-1) h, 18.75 +/- 0.43 h and 17.16 +/- 4.24 h respectively. Compound 1f was distributed into tissues rapidly and extensively after oral administration and the level of it was the highest in the liver, followed by in the kidney, and the lowest in brain. The acute toxicity assays in ICR rats of 1f showed that it had low acute toxicity with an LD50 value of 1459.89 mg kg(-1). These encouraging results make 1f an efficient, long-acting and safe antihypertensive drug candidate and deserving of further investigation.

MethodsFifteen secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) patients, 12 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients, and 14 matched healthy controls underwent C-11-PBR28 MR-PET. MS subjects underwent 7T <mml:msubsup>T2*</mml:msubsup>-weighted imaging for cortical lesion segmentation, and neurological and cognitive evaluation. C-11-PBR28 binding was measured using normalized 60- to 90-minute standardized uptake values and volume of distribution ratios. ResultsRelative to controls, MS subjects exhibited abnormally high C-11-PBR28 binding across the brain, the greatest increases being in cortex and cortical lesions, thalamus, hippocampus, and NAWM. MS WM lesions showed relatively modest TSPO increases. With the exception of cortical lesions, where TSPO expression was similar, C-11-PBR28 uptake across the brain was greater in SPMS than in RRMS. In MS, increased C-11-PBR28 binding in cortex, deep GM, and NAWM correlated with neurological disability and impaired cognitive performance; cortical thinning correlated with increased thalamic TSPO levels. InterpretationIn MS, neuroinflammation is present in the cortex, cortical lesions, deep GM, and NAWM, is closely linked to poor clinical outcome, and is at least partly linked to neurodegeneration. Distinct inflammatory-mediated factors may underlie accumulation of cortical and WM lesions. Quantification of TSPO levels in MS could prove to be a sensitive tool for evaluating in vivo the inflammatory component of GM pathology, particularly in cortical lesions.

Ligand-Independent Adenosine A<sub>2B</sub> Receptor Constitutive Activity as a Promoter of Prostate Cancer Cell Proliferation	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; INVERSE AGONISM; A2B RECEPTOR; IDENTIFICATION; PHARMACOLOGY; RADIOLIGAND; ANTAGONISTS; INDUCTION; BLOCKADE; MUTATION	Aberrant ligand-independent G protein-coupled receptor constitutive activity has been implicated in the pathophysiology of a number of cancers. The adenosine A(2B) receptor (A(2B)AR) is dynamically upregulated under pathologic conditions associated with a hypoxic microenvironment, including solid tumors. This, in turn, may amplify ligand-independent A(2B)AR signal transduction. The contribution of A(2B)AR constitutive activity to disease progression is currently unknown yet of fundamental importance, as the preferred therapeutic modality for drugs designed to reduce A(2B)AR constitutive activity would be inverse agonism as opposed to neutral antagonism. The current study investigated A(2B)AR constitutive activity in a heterologous expression system and a native 22Rv1 human prostate cancer cell line exposed to hypoxic conditions (2% O-2). The A(2B)AR inverse agonists, ZM241385 [4-(2-[7-amino-2-(2-furyl)[1,2,4]triazolo[2,3-a][1,3,5]triazin-5-ylamino]ethyl)phenol] or PSB-603 (8-(4-(4-(4-chlorophenyl)piperazide-1-sulfonyl)phenyl)-1-propylxanthine), mediated a concentration-dependent decrease in baseline cAMP levels in both cellular systems. Proliferation of multiple prostate cancer cell lines was also attenuated in the presence of PSB-603. Importantly, both the decrease in baseline cAMP accumulation and the reduction of proliferation were not influenced by the addition of adenosine deaminase, demonstrating that these effects are not dependent on stimulation of A(2B)ARs by the endogenous agonist adenosine. Our study is the first to reveal that wild-type human A(2B)ARs have high constitutive activity in both model and native cells. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that this ligand-independent A(2B)AR constitutive activity is sufficient to promote prostate cancer cell proliferation in vitro. More broadly, A(2B)AR constitutive activity may have wider, currently unappreciated implications in pathologic conditions associated with a hypoxic microenvironment.

For studying the molecular mechanisms and the biologic role of the GHB high-affinity binding sites, ligands with high and specific affinity are essential. The conformationally restricted GHB analog HOCPCA (3-hydroxycyclopent-1-enecarboxylic acid) is one such compound. The objective of this study was to investigate the transport of HOCPCA across the blood-brain barrier in vitro and in vivo and to investigate the hypothesis that HOCPCA, like GHB, is a substrate for the monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs). For in vitro uptake studies, MCT1, -2, and -4 were recombinantly expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, and the previously reported radioligand [H-3] HOCPCA was used as substrate. HOCPCA inhibited the uptake of the endogenous MCT substrate L-[C-14] lactate, and [H-3] HOCPCA was shown to act as substrate for MCT1 and 2 (Km values in the low-to mid-millimolar range). Introducing single-point amino acid mutations into positions essential for MCT function supported that HOCPCA binds to the endogenous substrate pocket of MCTs. MCT1-mediated brain entry of HOCPCA (10 mg/kg s.c.) was further confirmed in vivo in mice by coadministration of increasing doses of the MCT inhibitor AR-C141990 [(R)-5-(3-hydroxypyrrolidine-1-carbonyl)-1-isobutyl-3-methyl-6-(quinolin-4-ylmethyl) thieno[2,3-d] pyrimidine-2,4 (1H, 3H)-dione], which inhibited brain penetration of HOCPCA in a dose-dependent manner (ID50 = 4.6 mg/kg). Overall, our study provides evidence that MCT1 is an important brain entry site for HOCPCA and qualifies for future in vivo studies with HOCPCA.

Biodistribution of these compounds was compared with that of [C-11]CB148 and [C-11](R)-PK11195. Both [C-11]CB184 and [C-11]CB190 having C-11-methoxyl group on an aromatic ring were readily prepared using [C-11]methyl triflate. Biodistribution and metabolism of the compounds were examined with normal mice. An animal PET study using 6-hydroxydopamine treated rats as a model of neurodegeneration was pursued for proper estimation of feasibility of the radioligands to determine neuroinflammation process. [C-11]CB184 and [C-11]CB190 were obtained via O-methylation of corresponding desmethyl precursor using [C-11]methyl triflate in radiochemical yield of 73 % (decay-corrected). In vivo validation as a TSPO radioligand was carried out using normal mice and lesioned rats. In mice, [C-11]CB184 showed more uptake and specific binding than [C-11]CB190. Metabolism studies showed that 36 % and 25 % of radioactivity in plasma remained unchanged 30 min after intravenous injection of [C-11]CB184 and [C-11]CB190, respectively. In the PET study using rats, lesioned side of the brain showed significantly higher uptake than contralateral side after i.v. injection of either [C-11]CB184 or [C-11](R)-PK11195.

Main methods: Radioligand binding assays were used to quantify affinity, density and ratio of ET receptors. Design/methodology: 12-tungstophosphoric acid (HPW) was dispersed throughout three matrixes: Na, H-exchanged montmorillonites (Na-Mt, H-Mt) derived from Polish bentonite and commercially available K10 montmorillonite (Mt-K10). Two series of catalysts were prepared via conventional and modified impregnations. Conventional procedure based on the incipient wetness impregnation method involved stirring of the aqueous dispersion of HPW and montmorillonite, followed by drying at elevated temperature. Modified preparation method employed ultrasonication as a means of the dispersion homogenization, followed by freeze-drying. The catalysts were characterized by XRD, N-2 sorption, TG analysis, FT-IR and P-31 solid-state MAS-NMR spectroscopy. The acidic properties of HPW/montmorillonites were examined in the conversion of ethanol, whereas their catalytic performance was evaluated in the transesterification of castor oil with methanol. Findings: Intact Keggin anions were preserved on H-Mt and Mt-K10, while lacunary Keggin anions dominated on Na-Mt (especially after deposition aided by ultrasonication). Appropriate choice of the montmorillonite support and/or pretreatment allowed tailoring of the acidic function of the heteropolyacid supported catalysts. The use of H-Mt prepared under mild conditions resulted in enhanced acidity and high catalytic performance of acid catalysts, whereas the use of Na-Mt, aided by ultrasonication diminished their acidic function and catalytic activity. The most important achievement was to obtain HPW/montmorillonite system more active than unsupported HPW, via spreading heteropolyacid on H-Mt derived from Polish bentonite. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The present study explores the analgesic effects of a novel AlAR positive allosteric modulator, TRR469, in different models of acute and chronic pain in mice. To evaluate the allosteric enhancement, in vitro binding experiments were performed. The anti-nociceptive properties were investigated in formalin and writhing tests, and in the streptozotocin-induced diabetic neuropathic pain model. Rotarod and catalepsy tests were used to identify potential side effects, while the functional effect of TRR469 was studied using [H-3]-D-aspartate release from synaptosomes. TRR469 effectively inhibited nociceptive responses in the formalin and writhing tests, with effects comparable to those of the reference analgesic morphine. Isobolographic analysis of the combination of TRR469 and morphine revealed an additive interaction. TRR469 was anti-allodynic in the neuropathic pain model and did not display locomotor or cataleptic side effects. TRR469 enhanced the binding of the agonist radioligand [H-3]-CCPA and induced a 33-fold increase of adenosine affinity in spinal cord membranes. In mouse spinal cord synaptosomes, TRR469 enhanced the inhibitory effect of A(1)AR activation on [H-3]-D-aspartate release, a non-metabolizable analogue of glutamate. In conclusion, this research demonstrates the antinociceptive effect of the novel compound TRR469, one of the most potent and effective A(1)AR positive allosteric modulators so far synthesized. The use of TRR469 allows for the possibility of exploiting analgesic properties of endogenous adenosine, with a minor potential to develop the various side effects often associated with the use of direct receptor agonists.

CRH RECEPTOR ANTAGONISM REVERSES THE EFFECT OF SOCIAL SUBORDINATION UPON CENTRAL GABA<sub>A</sub> RECEPTOR BINDING IN ESTRADIOL-TREATED OVARIECTOMIZED FEMALE RHESUS MONKEYS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						social subordination; stress; flumazenil; astressin B; GABAA receptor; monkeys	CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING HORMONE; SEROTONIN REUPTAKE TRANSPORTER; PITUITARY-ADRENAL-FUNCTION; MESSENGER-RNA EXPRESSION; ASTRESSIN-B; RAT-BRAIN; PARAVENTRICULAR NUCLEUS; PARVOCELLULAR NEURONS; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; MAJOR DEPRESSION	Persistent exposure to environmental stressors causes dysregulation of the limbic-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (LHPA) axis and alters GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A)R) levels throughout the brain. Social subordination in socially housed female rhesus results in distinctive stress-related physiological and behavioral phenotypes that are dependent on the ovarian hormone estradiol (E2). In the present study, we utilized ovariectomized adult female rhesus monkeys undergoing hormone replacement with E2 to test the hypothesis that the chronic psychosocial stress of subordination alters GABA(A)R binding potential (GABA(A)R BPND) in limbic regions implicated in emotional processing including the prefrontal cortex, temporal lobe (amygdala and hippocampus), and hypothalamus. Furthermore, we tested the hypothesis that peripheral administration of a corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) receptor antagonist (astressin B) would reverse the alterations in GABA(A)R binding within these regions in subordinate females. After subjects received astressin B or saline for three consecutive days, GABA(A)R BPND was determined by positron emission tomography (PET) using F-18-flumazenil as a radioligand. T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging scans were also acquired for PET scan co-registration, in order to perform a region of interest analysis using the pons as a reference region. Compared to socially dominant females, subordinate females exhibited increased GABA(A)R BPND in the prefrontal cortex but not in the temporal lobe or the hypothalamus. Administration of astressin B eliminated the status difference in GABA(A)R BPND in the prefrontal cortex, suggesting that the chronic stressor of social subordination modulates GABAergic tone via effects on CRH and the LHPA axis, at least in prefrontal regions.

YOKUKANSAN INHIBITS MORPHINE TOLERANCE AND PHYSICAL DEPENDENCE IN MICE: THE ROLE OF α<sub>2A</sub>-ADRENOCEPTOR	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						morphine; physical dependence; tolerance; yokukansan; alpha(2)-adrenoceptor	TRADITIONAL JAPANESE MEDICINE; NALOXONE-PRECIPITATED WITHDRAWAL; GEISSOSCHIZINE METHYL-ETHER; YI-GAN-SAN; OPIATE WITHDRAWAL; LOCUS-COERULEUS; PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS; GLUTAMATE TRANSPORTER; AGGRESSIVE-BEHAVIOR; BRAIN-STEM	Yokukansan (YKS) is a traditional Japanese medicine consisting of seven medicinal herbs that is used for the treatment of neurosis, insomnia, and the behavioral/psychological symptoms of dementia. This study examined the effects of YKS on morphine tolerance and physical dependence in mice. Daily oral administration of YKS (0.5 or 1.0 g/kg) for 3 weeks significantly attenuated morphine tolerance and naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal signs (jumps and body weight loss) without affecting the analgesic effect of morphine. The inhibitory effect of YKS on withdrawal jumps in morphine-dependent mice was blocked by a single pretreatment with an alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine, but not by an alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin. A similar inhibitory effect on withdrawal jumps was observed by repeated administration of yohimbine. The membrane expression of alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors in the pons/medulla was decreased in morphine withdrawn animals; this reduction was prevented by repeated administration of YKS or yohimbine. Competitive radioligand and [S-35]guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) binding assays revealed that YKS and its constituent herbs, Glycyrrhiza (GR) and Uncaria hook (UH), had specific binding affinity for and antagonist activity against the alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor. Certain chemical constituents, including GR-derived glycyrrhizin and its metabolite, 18 beta-glycyrrhetinic acid, and UH-derived geissoschizine methyl ether (GME), shared such activities. Repeated administration of GR, UH, glycyrrhizin or GME significantly inhibited morphine withdrawal signs. These results suggest that YKS and its active constituents inhibit morphine tolerance and physical dependence, and that the latter is due at least in part to the prevention of the decreased membrane expression of the alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor in the brainstem by its prolonged blockade.

We hypothesized that striatal DVR values would be greater in depressed versus non-depressed subjects, and that greater DVR values may represent a possible clinical biomarker of depression. Methods: [Tc-99m]TRODAT-1 SPECT images were acquired from 39 depressed and 103 non-depressed drug-free subjects. The primary outcome measure was the DVR value of [Tc-99m]TRODAT-1 binding for the putamen region and the combined putamen plus caudate region. Results: DVR values were significantly correlated across all striatal regions within both subject groups (p<0.005). Depressed subjects had significantly greater DVR values (versus non-depressed subjects) in the putamen (p<0.0005) and the combined putamen plus caudate (p<0.0005) regions. There was no difference in DVR values between unipolar (n = 24) and bipolar (n = 15) depressed subjects, and no difference in DVR values for depressed subjects with or without prior antidepressant exposure. The predictive probability of the putamen or combined putamen plus caudate DVR value to distinguish depressed from non-depressed subjects was significant (p<0.0005). Limitations: DAT values could potentially be influenced by age, gender, diagnosis, prior psychotropic dug exposure, illness length, or symptom severity. Conclusion: Results confirm prior observations of greater striatal DAT density in depressed versus non-depressed subjects, and suggest that greater DVR values may possibly represent a potential diagnostic biomarker for distinguish depressed from non-depressed individuals.

Chronic Sazetidine-A at Behaviorally Active Doses Does Not Increase Nicotinic Cholinergic Receptors in Rodent Brain	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							PARTIAL AGONISTS VARENICLINE; ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; UP-REGULATION; BINDING-SITES; RAT-BRAIN; DESENSITIZING AGENT; CELLS; EXPRESSION; INFUSION; SMOKERS	Chronic nicotine administration increases alpha 4 beta 2 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) density in brain. This up-regulation probably contributes to the development and/or maintenance of nicotine dependence. nAChR up-regulation is believed to be triggered at the ligand binding site, so it is not surprising that other nicotinic ligands also up-regulate nAChRs in the brain. These other ligands include varenicline, which is currently used for smoking cessation therapy. Sazetidine-A (saz-A) is a newer nicotinic ligand that binds with high affinity and selectivity at alpha 4 beta 2* nAChRs. In behavioral studies, saz-A decreases nicotine self-administration and increases performance on tasks of attention. We report here that, unlike nicotine and varenicline, chronic administration of saz-A at behaviorally active and even higher doses does not up-regulate nAChRs in rodent brains. We used a newly developed method involving radioligand binding to measure the concentrations and nAChR occupancy of saz-A, nicotine, and varenicline in brains from chronically treated rats. Our results indicate that saz-A reached concentrations in the brain that were similar to 150 times its affinity for alpha 4 beta 2* nAChRs and occupied at least 75% of nAChRs. Thus, chronic administration of saz-A did not up-regulate nAChRs despite it reaching brain concentrations that are known to bind and desensitize virtually all alpha 4 beta 2* nAChRs in brain. These findings reinforce a model of nicotine addiction based on desensitization of up-regulated nAChRs and introduce a potential new strategy for smoking cessation therapy in which drugs such as saz-A can promote smoking cessation without maintaining nAChR up-regulation, thereby potentially increasing the rate of long-term abstinence from nicotine.

To better understand the regional and subcellular expression pattern of alpha 6-containing nAChRs, we created and studied transgenic mice expressing a variant alpha 6 subunit with green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused in-frame in the M3-M4 intracellular loop. In alpha 6-GFP transgenic mice, alpha 6-dependent synaptosomal DA release and radioligand binding experiments confirmed correct expression and function in vivo. In addition to strong alpha 6(star) nAChR expression in glutamatergic retinal axons, which terminate in superficial superior colliculus (sSC), we also found alpha 6 subunit expression in a subset of GABAergic cell bodies in this brain area. In patch-clamp recordings from sSC neurons in brain slices from mice expressing hypersensitive alpha 6(star) nAChRs, we confirmed functional, postsynaptic alpha 6(star) nAChR expression. Further, sSC GABAergic neurons expressing alpha 6(star) nAChRs exhibit a tonic conductance mediated by standing activation of hypersensitive alpha 6(star) nAChRs by ACh. alpha 6(star) nAChRs also appear in a subpopulation of SC neurons in output layers. Finally, selective activation of alpha 6(star) nAChRs in vivo induced sSC neuronal activation as measured with c-Fos expression. Together, these results demonstrate that alpha 6(star) nAChRs are uniquely situated to mediate cholinergic modulation of glutamate and GABA release in SC. The SC has emerged as a potential key brain area responsible for transmitting short-latency salience signals to thalamus and midbrain DA neurons, and these results suggest that alpha 6(star) nAChRs may be important for nicotinic cholinergic sensitization of this pathway.

Mutations in the gene encoding the GnRH receptor (GNRHR1) result in CHH when present as compound heterozygous or homozygous inactivating mutations. This study identifies and characterizes the properties of two novel GNRHR1 mutations in a family in which three brothers display normosmic CHH while their sister was unaffected. Molecular analysis in the proband and the affected brothers revealed two novel non-synonymous missense GNRHR1 mutations, present in a compound heterozygous state, whereas their unaffected parents possessed only one inactivating mutation, demonstrating the autosomal recessive transmission in this kindred and excluding X-linked inheritance equivocally suggested by the initial pedigree analysis. The first mutation at c.845 C>G introduces an Arg substitution for the conserved Pro 282 in transmembrane domain (TMD) 6. The Pro282Arg mutant is unable to bind radiolabeled GnRH analogue. As this conserved residue is important in receptor conformation, it is likely that the mutation perturbs the binding pocket and affects trafficking to the cell surface. The second mutation at c.968 A>G introduces a Cys substitution for Tyr 323 in the functionally crucial N/DPxxY motif in TMD 7. The Tyr323Cys mutant has an increased GnRH binding affinity but reduced receptor expression at the plasma membrane and impaired G protein-coupling. Inositol phosphate accumulation assays demonstrated absent and impaired G alpha(q/11) signal transduction by Pro282Arg and Tyr323Cys mutants, respectively. Pretreatment with the membrane permeant GnRHR antagonist NBI-42902, which rescues cell surface expression of many GNRHR1 mutants, significantly increased the levels of radioligand binding and intracellular signaling of the Tyr323Cys mutant but not Pro282Arg. Immunocytochemistry confirmed that both mutants are present on the cell membrane albeit at low levels. Together these molecular deficiencies of the two novel GNRHR1 mutations lead to the CHH phenotype when present as a compound heterozygote.

AMINO ACIDS			English	Article						Endothelial cells; Melanoma cells; Molecular imaging; Multiligand receptors; Protein radiolabeling; Small animal positron emission tomography (PET); S100 proteins	END-PRODUCTS RAGE; PROTEIN S100A4; ENDOTHELIAL-CELLS; TUMOR-SUPPRESSOR; METASTASIS; SURVIVAL; CANCER; TRANSLOCATION; INFLAMMATION; DYSFUNCTION	Data concerning the pathophysiological role of extracellular S100A4, a member of the multigenic family of Ca2+-modulated S100 proteins, and its interaction with the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) or other putative receptors in tumorigenesis, metastasis, and inflammatory processes in vivo are scarce. One reason is the shortage of suitable radiotracer methods. We report a novel methodology using recombinant human S100A4 as potential probe for molecular imaging and functional characterization of this interaction. Therefore, human S100A4 was cloned as GST fusion protein in the bacterial expression vector pGEX-6P-1 and expressed in E. coli strain BL21. Purified recombinant human S100A4 was radiolabeled with the positron emitter fluorine-18 (F-18) by conjugation with N-succinimidyl-4-[F-18] fluorobenzoate ([F-18]SFB). The radioligand [F-18]fluorobenzoyl-S100A4 (F-18-S100A4) was used in cell binding experiments in RAGE-bearing human melanoma cells and endothelial cells in vitro, and in both biodistribution experiments and small animal positron emission tomography (PET) studies in normal rats in vivo. The cellular association and tissue-specific distribution of F-18-S100A4 in vitro and in vivo correlated well with the protein expression and anatomical localization of RAGE, e.g., in the vascular system and in lung. Compared to other S100 RAGE radioligands, the overall findings of this study indicate that extracellular S100A4 in vivo shows only a moderate interaction with RAGE and, furthermore, exhibits a substantially faster metabolic degradation. On the other hand, the approach allows the use of quantitative small animal PET and provides a novel probe to both delineate functional expression and differentiate multiligand interaction of RAGE under normal and pathophysiological conditions in rodent models of disease.

Agonists at the δ-opioid receptor modify the binding of μ-receptor agonists to the μ-δ receptor hetero-oligomer	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						mu-opioid receptor; delta-opioid receptor; heteromer; binding pocket; internalization; clathrin; chronic morphine exposure	G-PROTEIN; MOLECULAR-CLONING; MULTIPLE STATES; DOWN-REGULATION; HETERODIMERIZATION; MORPHINE; DESENSITIZATION; EXPRESSION; POTENT; OPIATE	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE mu- and delta-opioid receptors form heteromeric complexes with unique ligand binding and G protein-coupling profiles linked to G protein alpha z-subunit (G alpha(z)) activation. However, the mechanism of action of agonists and their regulation of the mu-delta receptor heteromer are not well understood. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Competition radioligand binding, cell surface receptor internalization in intact cells, confocal microscopy and receptor immunofluorescence techniques were employed to study the regulation of the mu-delta receptor heteromer in heterologous cells with and without agonist exposure. KEY RESULTS G alpha(z) enhanced affinity of some agonists at mu-delta receptor heteromers, independent of agonist chemical structure. delta-Opioid agonists displaced mu-agonist binding with high affinity from mu-delta heteromers, but not mu receptor homomers, suggestive of delta-agonists occupying a novel mu-receptor ligand binding pocket within the heteromers. Also, delta-agonists induced internalization of mu-opioid receptors in cells co-expressing mu- and delta-receptors, but not those expressing mu-receptors alone, indicative of mu-delta heteromer internalization. This dose-dependent, Pertussis toxin-resistant and clathrin- and dynamin-dependent effect required agonist occupancy of both mu- and delta-opioid receptors. In contrast to mu-receptor homomers, agonist-induced internalization of mu-delta heteromers persisted following chronic morphine exposure. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS The mu-delta receptor heteromer may contain a novel delta-agonist-detected, high-affinity, mu-receptor ligand binding pocket and is regulated differently from the mu-receptor homomer following chronic morphine exposure. Occupancy of both mu- and delta-receptor binding pockets is required for delta-agonist-induced endocytosis of mu-delta receptor heteromers. delta-Opioid agonists target mu-delta receptor heteromers, and thus have a broader pharmacological specificity than previously identified.

We labeled the alpha(1A) and alpha(1L)-adrenoceptor selective antagonist silodosin (Kissei Pharmaceutical, Matsumoto, Japan) with the fluorophore Alexa Fluor (R) 488 (Alexa-488-silodosin) to visualize alpha(1L)-AR expression. Materials and Methods: Radioligand binding and functional bioassay experiments were done to assess alpha(1)-AR expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells and human prostate tissues. Confocal imaging was subsequently performed. Results: Although Alexa-488-silodosin had about 10 times lower affinity for all alpha(1)-AR subtypes than silodosin in binding and functional studies, it had high selectivity to alpha(1A) and alpha(1L)-ARs. Confocal imaging revealed clear localization of fluorescence on the membrane of Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing alpha(1A)-AR but not a(1B)-and alpha(1D)-ARs, and in the muscle layer of the human prostate. The fluorescent signal in Chinese hamster ovary cells disappeared in the presence of 3 nM prazosin but fluorescence was observed in the human prostate even in the presence of 100 nM prazosin. Conclusions: Alexa-488-silodosin is a powerful fluorescent probe with high selectivity to a1A and alpha(1L)-ARs. Thus, Alexa-488-silodosin successfully visualizes the site of alpha(1L)-ARs in the muscle layer of the human prostate without losing its distinct pharmacological profile.

In this study, 3AP and its 7 derivatives showed 100-1000-fold higher inhibitory potency on KB nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells than hydroxyurea and were fully active against hydroxyurea- and gemcitabine-resistant KB cells. In vitro RR assays using two recombinant RRs showed that all 8 HCrs decreased the activity of both RRs in a dose-dependent manner and the efficiency was compatible with that on cell proliferation inhibition. Iron has different impact on the behavior of the compounds toward RRs. In the absence of iron, the HCrs showed more selective inhibition for p53R2-M1 than M2-M1, while addition of iron increased their activity but reduced their selectivity for two RRs. Radioligand binding assays showed that [H-3]3AP directly bounded to the small subunits. Electron paramagnetic resonance measurements demonstrated that these HCrs generated reactive oxygen species with ferrous iron, which quenched the diiron-tyrosyl radical co-factor of the small subunits and hence the enzyme activity. While the ROS may be a common mediator responsible for the potent activity of the HCrs, the different characteristics of the small subunit proteins are probably associated with the subunit-selectivity of inhibition. Better understanding of the mechanism of action of RR inhibition may improve design of new potent and subunit-selective RR inhibitors for cancer therapy. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Although, the specific mechanism by which this action occurs has not been established. The aim of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effect of soy-isoflavones and the metabolite of daidzein, equol, on agonist-induced platelet responses dependent on thromboxane A(2) (TxA(2)) receptor. Material and methods: Competitive radioligand binding assay was used to screen for affinity of these compounds to the TxA2 receptor. The effect of equol on platelet activation, evaluate through of release of the ATP, by analogs of TxA(2) was analyzed. The effect of equol on platelet aggregation was investigated with ADP, U46619 (a TxA(2) mimic) and the calcium ionophore A23187. Results: The data showed that aglycone isoflavones and equol bind to TxA2 receptor in the mu mol/L range, whereas their glucoside derivates had very low binding activity for this receptor. Under equilibrium conditions, the following order of the relative affinity in inhibiting [H-3]-SQ29585 binding was: equol>genistein>daidzein>glycitein >> genistin, daidzin, glycitin. Equol interaction was reversible and competitive for labeled-SQ29548 with not apparent decrease in the number of TxA2 binding sites. In addition, from platelet activation studies, equol effectively inhibited ATP secretion elicited by the TxA2 analog U46619. On the other hand, equol inhibited the platelet aggregation induced by U46619 and A23187, while it failed to inhibit that induced by ADP. Conclusions: The aglycone isoflavones from soy, and particularly equol, have been found to have biological effects attributable to thromboxane A2 receptor antagonism. These findings may help elucidate how dietary isoflavone modulate platelet function and explain why soy-rich foods are claimed to have beneficial effects in the prevention of thrombotic events.

Saturation assay with a specific radioligand for alpha(1) adrenergic [H-3]-prazosin revealed two saturated and specific binding sites with high or low affinity. Competitive binding assay with different antagonist subtypes, defined pharmacologically three major types of alpha(1)-AR. The alpha(1)-AR agonists (from 1 x 10(-10) to 1 x 10(-4) M) triggered a biphasic action on DNA synthesis reaching maximal stimulation at 1 x 10(-9) M and maximal inhibition at 1 x 10(-6) M. Prazosin, abolished the stimulatory (pA(2): 9.24) and inhibitory (pA2: 8.80) actions of alpha(1)-AR agonists. The alpha(1)-AR stimulation resulted in the activation of phosphoinositide turnover (InsP) via phospholipase C (PLC) involving calcium/calmodulin (CaM) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) that correlates with the DNA synthesis increment; whereas the inhibition resulted in a decrease of cyclic AMP (cAMP) accumulation via adenylate cyclase inhibition. The potency displayed by the specific antagonists tested in binding, DNA synthesis, InsP and NOS at low agonist concentration suggests that they can be elicited by the activation of the same receptor (alpha(1B)-AR subtype); while the decrement in DNA synthesis and cAMP at high concentration account by the activation of alpha(1D)-AR coupled to G(i) protein. Non-functional (alpha(1A)-AR in neonatal human foreskin fibroblast was observed. Results suggest that the expression of alpha(1)-AR subtypes on human skin fibroblast may differentially activate signaling pathways that modulate physiological response of the cells.

Virodhamine and CP55,940 modulate cAMP production and IL-8 release in human bronchial epithelial cells	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						cannabinoids; virodhamine; CP55,940; human bronchial epithelium; interleukin-8; cAMP; tumour necrosis factor-alpha	CANNABINOID RECEPTORS; CB1 RECEPTOR; INTERLEUKIN-8 RELEASE; MAST-CELLS; PHARMACOLOGY; INHIBITION; ACTIVATION; EXPRESSION; AGONISTS; ANTAGONIST	Background and purpose: We investigated expression of cannabinoid receptors and the effects of the endogenous cannabinoid virodhamine and the synthetic agonist CP55,940 on cAMP accumulation and interleukin-8 (IL-8) release in human bronchial epithelial cells. Experimental approach: Human bronchial epithelial (16HBE14o(-)) cells were used. Total mRNA was isolated and cannabinoid receptor mRNAs were detected by RT-PCR. Expression of CB1 and CB2 receptor proteins was detected with Western blotting using receptor-specific antibodies. cAMP accumulation was measured by competitive radioligand binding assay. IL-8 release was measured by ELISA. Key results: CB1 and CB2 receptor mRNAs and proteins were found. Both agonists concentration-dependently decreased forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation. This effect was inhibited by the CB2 receptor antagonist SR144528, and was sensitive to Pertussis toxin (PTX), suggesting the involvement of CB2 receptors and G(i/o)-proteins. Cell pretreatment with PTX unmasked a stimulatory component, which was blocked by the CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716A. CB2 receptor-mediated inhibition of cAMP production by virodhamine and CP55,940 was paralleled by inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) induced IL-8 release. This inhibition was insensitive to SR141716A. In the absence of agonist, SR144528 by itself reduced TNF-alpha induced IL-8 release. Conclusions and implications: Our results show for the first time that 16HBE14o(-) cells respond to virodhamine and CP55,940. CB1 and CB2 receptor subtypes mediated activation and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, respectively. Stimulation of the dominant CB2 receptor signalling pathway diminished cAMP accumulation and TNF-alpha-induced IL-8 release. These observations may imply that cannabinoids exert anti-inflammatory properties in airways by modulating cytokine release.

Methods I-123-FP-CIT was administered intravenously 1 h after intraperitoneal injection of methylphenidate (3 mg(.)kg(-1), 10 mg(.)kg(-1)) or vehicle. Rats underwent scanning 2 h after radioligand application. From the spatial resolution of the imaging system and the size of the rat striatum followed that 'true' radioactivity concentrations were underestimated by similar to 50%. From cerebellar and partial volume corrected striatal radioactivity concentrations, striatal equilibrium ratios (V-3") were computed as estimations of the binding potential. Results Vehicle-treated animals yielded striatal V3" values of 3.5 +/- 0.9 (mean +/- SD). After pre-treatment with 3 mg(.)kg(-1) and 10 mg(.)kg(-1) methylpheniciate, striatal V-3" values were reduced to 2.4 +/- 0.8 (independent t-test, two-tailed, P = 0.026) and 1.7 +/- 0.6 (P < 0.001), respectively. Conclusions This first in-vivo study of rat dopamine transporter binding after pre-treatment with various doses of methylphenidate showed a dose-dependent reduction of striatal dopamine transporter binding. Results indicate that in-vivo quantification of dopamine transporter binding is feasible with I-123-FP-CIT and the TierSPECT method. This may be of future relevance for investigating in-vivo binding properties as well as pharmacological profiles of novel agents acting at the dopamine transporter binding site. Moreover, alterations of striatal transporter densities may be investigated in animal models of neurological and psychiatric diseases such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and Parkinson's disease.

Positron emission tomography studies were performed in healthy volunteers at placebo conditions and after treatment with clinical doses of moclobemide. In either condition, a two-tissue compartment model (2CM) provided better fits to the data than a one-tissue model. Estimates of k(3)/k(4) values from an unconstrained 2CM were highly variable. In contrast, estimates of the specifically bound radioligand distribution volume (DVB) from an unconstrained 2CM were exceptionally stable, correlated well with the known distribution of MAO-A in the brain (cerebellum < frontal cortex approximate to putamen < temporal cortex approximate to cingulate < thalamus) and thus provided reliable indices of MAO-A density. Total distribution volume (DV) values were also highly stable and not different from those estimated with the Logan approach. Fixing the DV of free and nonspecifically bound radiotracer (DVF+NS) or coupling DVF+NS between brain regions enabled more stable estimates of k(3)/k(4) as compared with an unconstrained 2CM. Moclobemide treatment leads to a 64% to 79% MAO-A blockade across brain regions, a result that supports the specificity of [C-11]-harmine binding to MAO-A. The stability and reliability of DVB values obtained from an unconstrained 2CM, together with the computational simplicity associated with this method, support the use of DVB as an appropriate outcome measure for [C-11]-harmine. These results indicate the suitability of using [C-11]-harmine for quantitative evaluation of MAO-A densities using PET and should enable further studies of potential MAO-A dysregulation in several psychiatric and neurologic illnesses.

Presumably, they bind to primary ( agonist) binding sites on the GPCR, although noncompetitive mechanisms of antagonism have been demonstrated but not thoroughly investigated. We studied noncompetitive antagonism by phenoxybenzamine and benextramine at alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors in stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, benextramine and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-[2-chloroethyl]piperidine hydrochloride (4-DAMP mustard) at endogenous muscarinic acetylcholine (mACh) receptors in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, and benextramine at serotonin 5-HT2A receptors in stably transfected SH-SY5Y cells. Primary binding sites were protected by reversible competitive antagonists during pretreatment with irreversible antagonists. We conducted appropriate radioligand binding assays by measuring remaining primary binding sites and agonist affinity, functional assays to evaluate agonist-induced responses, and constitutive guanosine 5'-O -(3-[(35) S] thio) triphosphate ([S-35] GTP gamma S)-G alpha(o) binding assays to determine remaining G protein activity. Phenoxybenzamine ( 100 mu M; 20 min) and benextramine ( 10 or 100 mu M; 20 min) at alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors, but not 4-DAMP mustard ( 100 nM; 120 min) at mACh receptors, displayed irreversible noncompetitive antagonism in addition to their known irreversible competitive antagonism. Although agonist binding affinity is not influenced, signal transduction is modulated in a G protein-dependent manner via allotopic interactions. Benextramine noncompetitively inhibits agonist- induced responses at three different GPCR types (alpha(2A), mACh, and 5-HT2A receptors) that signal via three families of G proteins ( G(i/o), G(s), and G(q/11)). We conclude that, where irreversible antagonists are utilized to study drug-receptor interaction mechanisms, the presence of significant irreversible noncompetitive antagonism may influence the interpretation of results under the experimental conditions used.

Studies with a newer benzamide called (123)I-epidepride, a high-affinity D(2) receptor (D(2)R) antagonist, showed high sensitivity in D(2)R-positive pituitary adenomas. We evaluated the presence of D(2)R in patients with uveal melanomas in vivo with (123)I- epidepride, and in vitro in melanomas, using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and (125)I-epidepride autoradiography. We studied the in vivo tumor-to-background (TB) ratios in six patients with posterior uveal melanoma (one previously enucleated). IHC was performed in 3 of 6 tumors after enucleation and in another 20 uveal melanomas, 7 metastatic lymph nodes from skin melanoma, and 2 normal specimens. (125)I-epidepride autoradiography was performed in 10 uveal melanomas (3 of which were studied in vivo), 7 metastases, and 2 normal samples. Radioligand uptake was present in the affected eye of 5 patients with uveal melanoma (TB = 3.1-6.1) and absent in the operated one (TB = 1). Eight uveal tumors were positive at IHC (35%), 14 weakly positive (61%), and 1 negative (4%). Two metastases were positive (29%), 2 weakly positive (29%), and 3 negative (42%). Two uveal tumors were positive at autoradiography (20%), 7 had nonspecific binding (70%), and 1 was negative (10%). One metastasis was positive (14%), while 6 were negative (86%). (123)I-epidepride scintigraphy in uveal melanomas seems promising for sensitivity and image quality. D(2)R was demonstrated in a significant proportion of the melanomas, although (123)I-epidepride uptake might also be nonspecific and unrelated to D(2)R binding. Although further studies on larger series are needed, (123)I-epidepride could represent a future tool to study the expression of D(2)R in other classes of neuroendocrine tumors.

Utilizing human control hippocampal sections it was shown that [H-3]-CGP62349 bound with high affinity (K-D 0.5 nM) to this tissue. 2 Hippocampal slices from surgical specimens obtained from patients with hippocampal sclerosis (HS) and temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) were compared with neurologically normal post-mortem control subjects for neuropathology and GABAB receptor density and affinity. Neuronal loss was observed in most of the hippocampal subregions, but in the subiculum no significant difference was detected. 3 The localization of GABAB receptors with the antagonist [H-3]-CGP62349 in human control hippocampal sections supported and extended earlier studies using the agonist ligand [H-3]-GABA. 4 The kinetics of binding to the GABAB receptor in human hippocampus using this novel compound was comparable to previous data obtained in rat hippocampal membranes. 5 GABAB receptor density (B-max) was significantly reduced in CA3, hilus, and dentate gyrus (DG); the affinity was increased exclusively in DG. The trend is identical in all the hippocampal subregions with the agonist and the antagonist, although significant differences with the antagonist where recorded in CA3 and hilus, whereas with the agonist a significant reduction was reported in all of the hippocampal subfields. 6 GABAB receptor expression per remaining neuron appeared significantly increased in CA3 and hilus. These results suggest altered GABAB receptor function may occur in human TLE, possibly as a result of synaptic reorganization, and may contribute to epileptogenesis.

It occurs in the endocrine, immune, and other peripheral organ systems and is expressed in a variety of human tumors. The [F-18]fluoroethyl analog of the sigma(1)-selective ligand SA4503 ([F-18]FE-SA4503) was prepared and evaluated in animals to investigate its suitability for in vivo measurement of sigma receptors with positron emission tomography (PET). [F-18]FE-SA4503 was synthesized by [F-18]fluoroethylation of the corresponding O-demethyl precursor in an overall radiochemical yield of 4-7% (EOB) with a specific activity of >100 TBq/mmol. The radioligand had higher in vitro affinity for the sigma receptor than SA4503 (IC50 sigma, 6.48 nM, IC50 sigma(2) 2.11 nM). [F-18]FE-SA4503 was injected into mice. Uptake could be blocked by co-injection of the sigma receptor ligands haloperidol, pentazocine, and cold SA4503, but not with other receptor ligands. Ex vivo autoradiography studies in rats showed regional distribution in the brain similar to [C-11]SA4503. Hippocampus, thalamus, and cortical areas were clearly delineated by [F-18]FE-SA4503. The uptake was blocked by SA4503 treatment. In the rat brain, only a small portion of metabolites (6.6% of brain radioactivity) was detected at 30 min postinjection, whereas in plasma the fraction of metabolites amounted to 51.3% of plasma radioactivity. The kinetics of [F-18]FE-SA4503 was measured with PET in the conscious monkey brain. High uptake values were found in the cortex, thalamus, cerebellum, and striatum, reaching a plateau value at 30 min postinjection. It is concluded that [F-18]FE-SA4503 showed specific binding to sigma receptors in three animal species. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Obese Zucker rats (OZR) were shown to be salt-sensitive in that they develop hypertension when placed on a high-salt diet. Because angiotensin (Ang) II is a major antinatriuretic factor, the present studies were undertaken to determine whether the characteristic of salt-sensitivity of OZR is associated with an enhanced antinatriuretic function of endogenous AngII. 2. The extent of AngII-mediated antinatriuresis was investigated in OZR and lean Zucker rats (LZR) using candesartan (100 mug/kg, i.v.), a selective angiotensin AT(1) receptor antagonist, and ramipril (1 mg/kg, i.v.), an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. The total number of AngII binding sites and their affinity were also assessed in renal cortical tubular membrane preparations of OZR and LZR using a specific radioligand-binding assay. Plasma renin activity was determined using a standard radioimmunoassay. 3. Both candesartan and ramipril produced substantially greater increases in urinary sodium excretion and urine flow in OZR and these effects were significantly greater than those observed in LZR. These observations suggest that basal antinatriuretic function of endogenous AngII is exaggerated in OZR. 4. The functional overexpression of AngII was not due to any alterations in the affinity or the total number of AngII binding sites in renal cortical tubular membranes. Higher plasma renin values in the OZR could have contributed to the phenomenon. 5. In conclusion, marked diuresis and natriuresis after AT(1) receptor blockade and/or ACE inhibition suggest that the extent of endogenous AngII-mediated sodium transport under basal conditions is greatly augmented in OZR. It is proposed this phenomenon may be a contributing factor for the salt- sensitivity in the OZR.

The present study was designed to investigate myocardial regulation of the different components of the ADM signaling system (ADM, ADM receptor, and receptor-activity-modifying protein-2, RAMP-2) during ischemic HF in rats and to identify the cells in the myocardium displaying ADM-like immunoreactivity (ADM-ir). Furthermore, the effects of endothelin (ET) receptor antagonism on expression of the myocardial ADM system during HF were investigated. Methods and Results-Northern blot analysis revealed increased ADM mRNA expression in the nonischemic left ventricle, with maximal levels 28 days after induction of myocardial infarction (1.5-fold, P < 0.05) compared with the sham group. Parallel elevations of myocardial ADM receptor and RAMP-2 mRNA levels were also observed (2.3- and 1.5-fold increase, respectively; P < 0.05). In addition, high levels of ADM mRNA were seen in the ischemic region. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a substantial increase of ADM-ir in microvascular endothelium and perivascular interstitial cells of myocardial tissue contiguous to the ischemic region. In addition, radioligand binding studies demonstrated a 1.6-fold increase of specific ADM binding sites in the failing left ventricle (P < 0.05). Intervention with the mixed ETA/ETB receptor antagonist bosentan (100 mg . kg(-1) . day(-1) PO) for 15 days prevented the increase of RAMP-2 mRNA. Conclusions-The study demonstrates a concerted induction of several components of the myocardial ADM signaling system during postinfarction failure and that the vessels are the main source of myocardial ADM. Our observations indicate a role for ADM as an autocrine/paracrine factor during ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction.

As a first step towards the development of a kinetic model for quantification of C-11-choline uptake, blood metabolism of C-11-choline during PET imaging was studied in humans. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and thin-layer chromatography (TLC) were used for the analysis of C-11-choline and its radioactive metabolites. Prior to human PET imaging we studied ex vivo the biodistribution and metabolism of intravenously administered C-11-choline in rats. Our results revealed that the radioactivity accumulated particularly in kidney. lung, adrenal gland and liver. Chromatographic analysis showed that the level of unmetabolized C-11-choline in rat plasma decreased from 42%+/-20% (mean+/-SD) at 5 min to 21%+/-10% at 15 min after injection. In accordance with these findings, in humans the unmetabolized C-11-choline represents 62%+/-19% of the total radioactivity in arterial plasma at 5 min after injection and 27%+/-12% at 15 min. In human venous plasma the corresponding values were 85%+/-12% and 48%+/-12% at 5 and 10 min, respectively. The major metabolite observed in both human and rat plasma was identified as C-11-betaine, In human arterial plasma this maximally represented 82%+/-9% of the total radioactivity at 25 min after radiotracer injection. By 20 min after injection, the C-11-choline and C-11-betaine in human arterial plasma reached a plateau, and their fractional activities remained nearly constant thereafter. Although most of the circulating C-11-choline in blood is transported to tissues, it does not disappear totally from blood within the first 40 min after tracer injection.

Previous studies demonstrated that sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) modulators effectively inhibit S1PR1 in immune cell trafficking and reduce entry of pathogenic cells into the CNS. Studies have also implicated a nonimmune, inflammatory role of S1PR1 within the CNS in MS. In this study, we explored the expression of S1PR1 in the development and progression of demyelinating pathology of MS by quantitative assessment of S1PR1 expression using our S1PR1-specific radioligand, [H-3]CS1P1, in the postmortem human CNS tissues including cortex, cerebellum, and spinal cord of MS cases and age- and sex-matched healthy cases. Immunohistochemistry with whole slide scanning for S1PR1 and various myelin proteins was also performed. Autoradiographic analysis using [H-3]CS1P1 showed that the expression of S1PR1 was statistically significantly elevated in lesions compared to nonlesion regions in the MS cases, as well as normal healthy controls. The uptake of [H-3]CS1P1 in the gray matter and nonlesion white matter did not significantly differ between healthy and MS CNS tissues. Saturation autoradiography analysis showed an increased binding affinity (K-d) of [H-3]CS1P1 to S1PR1 in both gray matter and white matter of MS brains compared to healthy brains. Our blocking study using NIBR-0213, a S1PR1 antagonist, indicated [H-3]CS1P1 is highly specific to S1PR1. Our findings demonstrated the activation of S1PR1 and an increased uptake of [H-3]CS1P1 in the lesions of MS CNS. In summary, our quantitative autoradiography analysis using [H-3]CS1P1 on human postmortem tissues shows the feasibility of novel imaging strategies for MS by targeting S1PR1.

However, it is technically challenging to assess the turnover of 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG), the principal endocannabinoid molecule in the brain. Two recent studies showed that diacylglycerol lipase alpha (DAGL alpha), an enzyme chiefly responsible for the cerebral production of 2-AG, also accepts the surrogate chromogenic substrate 4-nitrophenyl butyrate (4-NPB). Here, we aimed to optimize this spectrophotometric assay for ex vivo brain tissue, in particular, rat cerebrocortical homogenates, to measure the activity of the major enzymes responsible for the production and degradation of 2-AG. The initial velocity of 4-NPB hydrolysis was dependent on protein, substrate, and Ca(2+)concentrations, and was sensitive to the non-selective serine hydrolase inhibitor, methoxy arachidonyl fluorophosphonate, the DAGL alpha inhibitors, OMDM188, tetrahydrolipstatin, and RHC80267, as well as the monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) inhibitor, JZL184, respectively. Next, we tested the usefulness of this assay in ex vivo brain tissue of rat models of human health conditions known to affect cerebrocortical 2-AG production,i.e. pathological stress and sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). In rats submitted to chronic restraint stress, cortical CB1R density was significantly decreased, as assessed with radioligand binding. Nevertheless, 4-NPB hydrolysis remained at control levels. However, in rats 4 weeks after intracerebroventricular injection with streptozotocin - an established model of sporadic AD -, both CB1R levels and 4-NPB hydrolysis and its DAGL- and MAGL-dependent fractions were significantly increased. Altogether, we optimized a simple complementary ex vivo technique for the quantification of DAGL and MAGL activity in brain samples.

Its ligands have been shown to possess therapeutic potential for neurological and substance use disorders among others. The E102Q mutation of sigma 1R has been found to elicit familial cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Despite reports of its downstream signaling consequences, the mechanistic details of the functional impact of E102Q at molecular level are not clear. Here, we investigate the molecular mechanism of the E102Q mutation with a spectrum of biochemical, biophysical, and pharmacological approaches. Our analysis of the interaction network of sigma 1R indicates that a set of residues near E102 is critical for the integrity of C-terminal ligand-binding domain. However, this integrity is not affected by the E102Q and E102A mutations, which is confirmed by the radioligand binding results. Instead, the E102 mutations disrupt the connection between the C-terminal domain and the N-terminal transmembrane helix (NT-helix). Results from bioluminescence resonance energy transfer and western blot assays demonstrate that these mutations destabilize higher-order sigma 1R oligomers, while our molecular dynamics simulations based on a sigma 1R crystal structure reveal a potential mechanism by which the mutations perturb the NT-helix dynamics. Thus, we propose that E102 is at a critical position in propagating the effects of ligand binding from the C-terminal domain to the NT-helix, while the latter may be involved in forming alternative oligomer interfaces, separate from the previously reported trimer interface. Together, these results provide the first account of the molecular mechanism of sigma 1R dysfunction caused by E102Q.

The aim of the study was to find a rationale for prostate specific membrane antigen based imaging and investigate the prognostic role of vascular prostate specific membrane antigen expression in patients with renal cell carcinoma. Materials and Methods: A total of 257 patients with renal cell carcinoma were included in study with a median followup exceeding 10.0 years. Prostate specific membrane antigen expression on tumor vessels was detected by immunohistochemistry. Vascular expression of FOLH1 gene (prostate specific membrane antigen) mRNA was investigated in clear cell carcinoma and papillary renal cell carcinoma using TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) data. Results: Endothelial prostate specific membrane antigen protein expression was higher in clear cell than in papillary and chromophobe renal cell carcinoma. Higher grade and stage, metastatic and lethal clear cell renal cell carcinoma showed higher prostate specific membrane antigen expression in tumor vessels. On univariate and multivariate analysis the intensity of positive vs negative endothelial prostate specific membrane antigen protein expression was significantly associated with overall survival. TCGA based analyses confirmed the prognostic role of vascular expression of FOLH1 mRNA. The analyses also supported the usefulness of prostate specific membrane antigen based imaging in cases of clear cell but not papillary renal cell carcinoma. Conclusions: We provide a rationale for further development of prostate specific membrane antigen targeted imaging in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma. The prognostic role of prostate specific membrane antigen was determined at the protein level in clear cell renal cell carcinoma and at the mRNA level in clear cell and papillary renal cell carcinoma.

Suppressed Fat Appetite after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery Associates with Reduced Brain μ-opioid Receptor Availability in Diet-Induced Obese Male Rats	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						bariatric surgery; caloric-restriction; fat appetite; Brain mu-opioid receptors; positron emission tomography imaging	INDUCED WEIGHT-LOSS; BARIATRIC SURGERY; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; EATING BEHAVIOR; FOOD REWARD; STIMULATION; MECHANISMS; GASTROPLASTY; ANTAGONIST; RESPONSES	Brain mu-opioid receptors (MORs) stimulate high-fat (HF) feeding and have been implicated in the distinct long term outcomes on body weight of bariatric surgery and dieting. Whether alterations in fat appetite specifically following these disparate weight loss interventions relate to changes in brain MOR signaling is unknown. To address this issue, diet-induced obese male rats underwent either Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sham surgeries. Postoperatively, animals were placed on a two-choice diet consisting of low-fat (LF) and HF food and sham-operated rats were further split into ad libitum fed (Sham-LF/HF) and body weight-matched (Sham-BWM) to RYGB groups. An additional set of sham-operated rats always only on a LF diet (Sham-LF) served as lean controls, making four experimental groups in total. Corresponding to a stage of weight loss maintenance for RYGB rats, two-bottle fat preference tests in conjunction with small-animal positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies with the selective MOR radioligand [11C]carfentanil were performed. Brains were subsequently collected and MOR protein levels in the hypothalamus, striatum, prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex were analyzed by Western Blot. We found that only the RYGB group presented with intervention-specific changes: having markedly suppressed intake and preference for high concentration fat emulsions, a widespread reduction in [11C]carfentanil binding potential (reflecting MOR availability) in various brain regions, and a downregulation of striatal and prefrontal MOR protein levels compared to the remaining groups. These findings suggest that the suppressed fat appetite caused by RYGB surgery is due to reduced brain MOR signaling, which may contribute to sustained weight loss unlike the case for dieting.

Tau Immunotherapy	NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	12th International Conference on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases and Related Neurological Disorders (AD/PD (TM))	MAR 18-22, 2015	Nice, FRANCE			Tau immunotherapy; Tauopathies; Alzheimer's disease	TANGLE MOUSE MODEL; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; PASSIVE-IMMUNIZATION; NEUROFIBRILLARY PATHOLOGY; IN-VIVO; PROTEIN; ANTIBODIES; MICE; PET; RADIOLIGAND	In recent years, tau immunotherapy has advanced from proof-of-concept studies [Sigurdsson EM, NIH R01AG020197, 2001; Asuni AA, et al: J Neurosci 2007;27:9115-9129], which have now been confirmed and extended by us and others. Phase I clinical trials on active and passive tau immunizations are being conducted, with several additional passive tau antibody trials likely to be initiated in the near future for Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies. Because tau pathology correlates better with the degree of dementia than amyloid-beta (A beta) pathology, greater clinical efficacy may be achieved by clearing tau than A beta aggregates in the later stages of the disease, when cognitive impairments become evident. Substantial insight has now been obtained regarding which epitopes to target, mechanism of action and potential toxicity, but much remains to be clarified. All of these factors likely depend on the model/disease or stage of pathology and the immunogen/antibody. Interestingly, tau antibodies interact with the protein both extra- and intracellularly, but the importance of each site for tau clearance is not well defined. Some antibodies are readily taken up into neurons, whereas others are not. It can be argued that extra cellular clearance may be safer but less efficacious than intraneuronal clearance and/or sequestration to prevent secretion and further spread of tau pathology. Development of therapeutic tau antibodies has led to antibody-derived imaging probes, which are more specific than the dye-based compounds that are already in clinical trials. Such specificity may give valuable information on the pathological tau epitope profile, which could then guide the selection of therapeutic antibodies for maximal efficacy and safety. Hopefully, tau immunotherapy will be effective in clinical trials, and further advanced by mechanistic clarification in experimental models with insights from biomarkers and postmortem analyses of clinical subjects.

Ovariectomy and MPTP lesion were performed four years before the estrogen treatment to model postmenopausal PD patients. SERT was measured by autoradiography using the radioligand [H-3]Citalopram. Specific binding to SERT decreased in anterior cerebral cortex, nucleus accumbens, caudate nucleus and putamen on the lesioned side of 17 beta-estradiol and vehicle-treated monkeys compared to the intact side. In caudate nucleus and putamen the lesioned-induced decrease of [H-3] Citalopram specific binding was more extensive in anterior and middle than posterior parts. [H-3]Citalopram specific binding was increased in the cortex anterior cingulate gyrus of monkeys treated with 17 beta-estradiol in both brain hemispheres and was unchanged in the other brain regions investigated including the raphe nucleus. Positive correlations between [H-3]Citalopram specific binding and 5-HT as well as 5-HIAA concentrations (reported previously) were obtained in the caudate nucleus and putamen and a negative correlation between SERT binding and 5-HIAA/5-HT concentration ratio suggesting MPTP lesion-induced 5-HT neuronal loss and lower 5-HT neurotransmission controlling and decreasing SERT for homeostasis. 17 beta-estradiol treatment initiated four years after ovariectomy of monkeys modeling hormonal conditions of post-menopause shows that SERT still displays some responsiveness to estrogens as observed in the anterior cingulate cortex. These results support a role of estrogens in 5-HT activity in PD. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Firstly, the affinities of several histaminergic agonists for the rat histamine H-3 and H-4 receptors were checked in HEK 293 T cells transfected with either receptor subtype. Next, functional activities were determined in conscious rat against the ulcerogenic effect of 0.6 N HCl. Radioligand binding studies showed that immethridine and methimepip were the most selective agonists at rat H-3 receptors, whereas VUF10460 displayed approximately a 50-fold selectivity for the rat H-4 receptor over the H-3 receptor. In conscious rats, immethridine and methimepip significantly reduced (66% and 48% inhibition, respectively) the gastric lesions induced by HCl; the effect of immethridine was antagonized by the H-3 receptor antagonist A-331440, but not by the H-4 receptor antagonist JNJ7777120. The mixed H-3/H-4 receptor agonist immepip induced a significant aggravation of HCl damage, which was prevented by JNJ7777120; HCl-induced lesions were also significantly enhanced by the H-4 receptor agonists VUF10460 and VUF8430; however, this effect was not modified by JNJ7777120. Overall, this study indicates that, whereas the histamine H-3 receptor is involved in the protection of rat stomach against concentrated HCl, the functional role of the H-4 receptor is still to be defined, although selective agonists induce proulcerogenic effects under HCl challenge. Finally, the species-dependent variations in affinity and receptor selectivity observed for most ligands need to be carefully addressed in the pharmacological characterization of histamine H-3 and H-4 receptor functions in vivo.

We investigated the biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of (2R,3R,11bR)-9-(3-F-18-fluoropropoxy)-3-isobutyl-10-methoxy-2,3,4,6,7,11b-hexahydro-1H-pyrido[2,1-a]isoquinolin-2-ol (F-18-FP-(+)-dihydrotetrabenazine [DTBZ] or F-18-AV-133), a potential VMAT2 imaging agent showing encouraging results in humans, to facilitate its future clinical use. Methods: Nine healthy human subjects (mean age 6 SD, 58.6 +/- 4.2 y) were enrolled for the whole-body PET scan. Serial images were acquired for 3 h immediately after a bolus injection of 390.7 +/- 22.9 MBq of F-18-AV-133 per individual. The source organs were delineated on PET/CT images. The OLINDA/EXM application was used to determine the equivalent dose for individual organs. Results: The radiotracer did not show any noticeable adverse effects for the 9 subjects examined. The radioactivity uptake in the brain was the highest at 7.5% +/- 0.6% injected dose at 10 min after injection. High absorbed doses were found in the pancreas, liver, and upper large intestine wall. The highest-dosed organ, which received 153.3 +/- 23.8 mGy/MBq, was the pancreas. The effective dose equivalent and effective dose for F-18-AV-133 were 36.5 +/- 2.8 and 27.8 +/- 2.5 mu Sv/MBq, respectively. These values are comparable to those reported for any other F-18-labeled radiopharmaceutical. Conclusion: F-18-AV-133 is safe, with appropriate biodistribution and radiation dosimetry for imaging VMAT2 sites in humans.

Therefore, the rationale of this positron emission tomography (PET) study was to investigate the influence of the 5-HT1A receptor distribution in the human brain on plasma levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and cortisol in vivo. Eighteen healthy female were measured with PET and the selective 5-HT1A receptor radioligand [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635. Nine a priori defined brain regions (hypothalamus, orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, anterior and posterior cingulate cortices, dorsal raphe nucleus, retrosplenial cortex, and insula) and the cerebellum (reference region) were delineated on coregistered MR images. DHEAS and cortisol plasma levels were collected by blood sampling in the morning of the PET day. Linear regression analysis of DHEAS plasma level as dependent variable and hypothalamic 5-HT1A receptor binding potential (BP) as independent variable showed a highly significant association (r=.691, p=.002). The hypothalamic 5-HT1A BP predicted 47.7% of the variability in DHEAS plasma levels. Regressions were borderline significant (p < .01, Bonferroni corrected threshold <.0056) between 5-HT1A BP in the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices and free cortisol levels. No significant associations between DHEAS or cortisol and the 5-HT1A receptor BP in other investigated brain regions were found. In conclusion, the serotonergic system may influence the DHEAS plasma level by modulating CRH and ACTH release via hypothalamic 5-HT1A receptors as reported for cortisol before. As disturbances of the HPA axis as well as changes of the 5-HT1A receptor distribution have been reported in affective disorders, future studies should focus on these interactions.

Choline or CDP-choline attenuates coagulation abnormalities and prevents the development of acute disseminated intravascular coagulation in dogs during endotoxemia	BLOOD COAGULATION & FIBRINOLYSIS			English	Article						CDP-choline; choline; DIC; dog; endotoxin; hemostasis	INCREASES SERUM-INSULIN; INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE; SEVERE SEPSIS; ACETYLCHOLINE; STIMULATION; RELEASE; SYSTEM; INVOLVEMENT; METABOLITES; DYSFUNCTION	Sepsis/endotoxemia causes platelet dysfunctions, abnormalities in coagulation and hemostatic mechanisms leading to organ dysfunctions and mortality. Choline prevents organ injury and improves survival during endotoxemia. The main objective of the present study was to determine the effects of choline or cytidine-5'-diphosphocholine (CDP-choline) on endotoxin-induced activation of coagulation and development of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Dogs were treated intravenously (i.v.) with saline, choline (20 mg/kg), or CDP-choline (70 mg/kg) three times with 4-h intervals starting 5 min before i.v. injection of endotoxin (1 mg/kg). Platelet counts and functions, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen, coagulation factors, D-dimer and antithrombin (AT) were measured before and at 0.5-96 h after endotoxin. Circulating platelet, fibrinogen, coagulation factors and AT were decreased, whereas PT and aPTT were prolonged and serum D-dimer levels were elevated after endotoxin. Endotoxin-induced reductions in platelet counts and functions, fibrinogen, coagulation factors and AT were attenuated or blocked by choline or CDP-choline. Choline or CDP-choline blocked endotoxin-induced prolongation in PT and aPTT and enhancement in D-dimer. Elevated DIC scores were attenuated by choline and blocked by CDP-choline. Choline administration increased serum choline concentrations and caused bradycardia. Choline also increased choline and acetylcholine contents of circulating mononuclear cells and inhibited radioligand binding to their cholinergic receptors. These data show that choline administration, as choline chloride or CDP-choline, restores the abnormalities in the primary, secondary, and tertiary hemostasis and prevents the development of DIC during experimental endotoxemia in dogs probably by increasing both neuronal and nonneuronal cholinergic activity.

Reliability of the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor antibodies level determination in diagnosing and prognosing of immunogenic hyperthyroidism	VOJNOSANITETSKI PREGLED			Serbian	Article						graves disease; radioligand assay; diagnosis, differential; prognosis	GRAVES-DISEASE; THYROTROPIN-RECEPTOR; CLINICAL-APPLICATIONS; 2ND-GENERATION ASSAY; AUTOIMMUNE; SENSITIVITY; GENERATION; AUTONOMY; COMPLEX	Background/Aim. Graves disease (GD) is defined as hyperthyroidism with diffuse goiter caused by immunogenic disturbances. Antibodies to the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) receptors of thyroid gland (TRAb) have crucial pathogenetic importance in the development and maintenance of autoimmune hyperthyroidism. The aim of this study was to identify sensitivity, specificity, positive an negative predictive velue of TRAb level in sera of patients with GD as well as to estimate significance of TRAb level for remission and GD relapses occurrence. Methods. We studied prospectively and partly retrospectively 149 patients, 109 female and 40 male patients, 5-78 years old, in the period 1982-2007. There were 96 patients with GD. The control group consisted of 53 patients, 21 with hyperthyroidism of second etiology and 32 patients on amiodarone therapy, with or without thyroid dysfunction TRAb was measured by radioreceptor assay (TRAK Assay and DYNO Test TRAK Human Brahms Diagnostica GMBH). Results. According to the results the sensitivity (Sn) of TRAb test was 80%, specificity (Sp) 100%, positive predictive value (PP) 100% and negative predictive value (NP) 83%. Also, the Sn of hTRAb test was 94%, Sp 100%, PP 100% and NP 94%. Our results show that an increased level of TRAb/hTRAb at the beginning of the disease and the level at the end of medical therapy is associated with an increased number of GD relapses and a shorter remission duration. Conclusion. Detection and measurement of TRAb in serum is a very sensitive method for diagnosing GD and very highly specific in vitro method for differential diagnosis of various forms of hyperthyroidism. Clinical significance of differentiating various forms of hyperthyroidism, using this in vitro assay, lays in adequate therapeutic choice for these entities.

PAR desensitization proceeds by at least such three mechanisms as heterologous desensitization, homologous desensitization and a kind of agonist-induced rapid phosphorylation by a variety of serine/threonine kinases. It is not clear whether there are other mechanisms. This study aimed to investigate potential mechanisms of beta(2)AR desensitization. Methods Twenty-four BALB/c (6-8 weeks old) mice were divided into three groups, which is, group A, phosphate buffered saline (PBS)-treated; group B, ovalbumin (OVA)-induced; and group C, salbutamol-treated. Inflammatory cell counts, cytokine concentrations of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), pathological sections, total serum IgE, airway responsiveness, membrane receptor numbers and total amount of beta(2)AR were observed. Asthmatic mouse model and beta(2)AR desensitization asthmatic mouse model were established. Groups B and C were selected for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) analysis so as to find key protein spots related to beta(2)AR desensitization. Results Asthmatic mouse model and beta(2)AR desensitization asthmatic mouse model were verified by inflammatory cell count, cytokine concentration of BALF, serum IgE level, airway hyperreactivity measurement, radioligand receptor binding assay, Western blot analysis, and pathologic examination. Then the two groups (groups B and C) were subjected to 2DE. Two key protein spots associated with beta(2)AR desensitization, Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor 2 (RhoGDI(2)) and peroxiredoxin 5, were found by comparative proteornics (2DE and mass spectrum analysis). Conclusion Oxidative stress and small G protein regulators may play an important role in the process of beta(2)AR desensitization.

Radiosynthesis and biodistribution of a histamine H<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist 4-[3-(4-piperidin-1-yl-but-1-ynyl)-[<SUP>11</SUP>C]benzyl]-morpholine:: evaluation of a potential PET ligand	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						histamine H-3 receptor; antagonist; brain; biodistribution; autoradiography; PET ligand	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; RAT-BRAIN CORTEX; RELEASE; BINDING; CLONING; INHIBITION; EXPRESSION; ISOFORMS; MICE; DERIVATIVES	The potent histamine H-3 receptor antagonist JNJ-10181457 (1) was successfully labeled with C in a novel one-pot reaction sequence, with high chemical yield (decay-corrected yield, 28 +/- 8%) and high specific radioactivity (56 +/- 26 GBq/mu mol). The binding of [C-11]1 to H-3 receptors was studied in vitro in rat brain and in vivo in rats and mice. The in vitro binding of [C-11]1 in rat coronal brain slices showed high binding in the striatum, and this binding was blocked by histamine and by two known H-3 antagonists, JNJ-5207852 (2) and unlabeled Compound (1), in a concentration-dependent manner. The biodistribution of [C-11]1 in rats was measured at 5, 10, 30 and 60 min. The uptake of [C-11]1 in regions rich in H-3 receptors was highest at 30 min, giving 0.98%, 1.41%, 1.28% and 1.72% dose/g for the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, striaturn and cerebral cortex, respectively. However, the binding of [C-11]1 in the rat brain could not be blocked by pretreatment with either Compound (2) (30 min or 24 h pretreatment) or cold Compound (1) (30-min pretreatment). The biodistribution of [C-11]1 in a second species (Balb/c mice) showed a higher overall uptake of the radioligand with an average brain uptake of 8.9% dose/g. In C57BL/6H(3)(-/-) knockout mice, a higher brain uptake was also observed. Analyses of metabolites and plasma protein binding were also undertaken. It appeared that [C-11]1 could not specifically label H-3 receptors in rodent brain in vivo. Possible causes are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The subnanomolar PBR affinity shown by N-benzyl-3-chloromethyl-N-methyl-4-phenyl-2-quinolinecarboxamide (6b) suggested its chlorine atom to be replaced with other halogens in order to optimize the interaction of the quinolinecarboxamide derivatives with PBR and to develop suitable candidates for positron emission tomography (PET) or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies. The binding studies led to the discovery of fluoromethyl derivative 6a, which showed an IC50 value of 0.11 nM and is, therefore, one of the most potent PBR ligands so far described. Fluoromethyl derivative 6a has been labeled with C-11 (t(1/2) = 20.4 min, beta(+) = 99.8%) starting from the corresponding des-methyl precursor (14) using [C-11]CH3I in the presence of tetrabutylammonium hydroxide in DMF with a 35-40% radiochemical yield (corrected for decay) and 1.5 Ci/mu mol of specific radioactivity. Ex vivo rat biodistribution and inhibition (following intravenous pre-administration of PK11195) studies showed that [C-11]6a rapidly and specifically accumulated in PBR-rich tissues such as heart, lung, kidney, spleen, and adrenal, and at a lower level in other peripheral organs and in the brain. The images obtained in mouse with small animal YAP-(S)PET essentially confirmed the result of the ex vivo biodistribution experiments. The biological data suggest that [C-11]6a is a promising radioligand for peripheral benzodiazepine receptor PET imaging in vivo. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Sumanirole, (R)-5,6-dihydro-5-(methylamino)-4H- imidazo[4,5,1-ij] quinolin-2(1H)one (Z)-2-butenedioate (1:1), is unique; it has greater than 200-fold selectivity for the D-2 receptor subtype versus the other dopamine receptor subtypes in radioligand binding assays. In cell-based assays, sumanirole is a fully efficacious agonist, with EC50 values between 17 and 75 nM. In animals, sumanirole elicits many physiological responses attributed to D-2-like receptor function. In rats, sumanirole is a full agonist for elevation of striatal acetylcholine levels (ED50 = 12.1 mu mol/kg i.p.). Sumanirole s.c. dose dependently decreased plasma prolactin levels and depressed dopamine neuron firing rates in the substantia nigra pars compacta with an ED50 of 2.3 mu mol/kg i.v. This high selectivity for D-2 receptors translates into excellent locomotor stimulant activity in animal models of Parkinson's disease. In reserpinized, alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine-treated rats, sumanirole caused a significant and sustained increase in horizontal activity at doses >= 12.5 mu mol/kg s.c. In unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats, sumanirole caused profound, sustained rotational behavior and was substantially more efficacious than any other agonist tested. Sumanirole-stimulated rotational behavior was blocked by the dopamine receptor antagonist haloperidol. Sumanirole dose dependently improved disability scores and locomotor activities of two of three 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-lesioned monkeys. In summary, sumanirole is the first published selective D-2 receptor agonist. The compound has activity in animal models of dopamine hypofunction and has a high level of efficacy in animal models of Parkinson's disease.

[C-11]Methyl iodide was used to label the compounds under basic conditions, and a Pd(0) catalyst was applied to label [C-11]MPEP in a Stille coupling reaction. In vivo microPET imaging studies of the functional accumulation of radiolabeled ligands were conducted in 35 rats (Sprague-Dawley, 8 weeks old male, weight of 300 g). Specific binding was tested using pre-administration of unlabeled mGluR5 antagonist 2-methyl-6-(2-phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP) (10 mg/kg iv 5 min before radioactivity injection). In the radiolabeling of [C-11]MPEP, [C-11]M-MPEP and [C-11]M-PEPy, a specific radioactivity of 700-1200 mCi/mu mol and over 97% radiochemical purity were obtained. The microPET studies showed these three radiolabeled mGIuR5 antagonists having the highest binding in the olfactory bulb followed by striatum, hippocampus and cortex. Pre-administration of the mGluR5 antagonist MPEP induced a 45.1% decrease in [C-11]MPEP binding, a 59.7% decrease in [C-11]M-MPEP binding and an 84.6% decrease in [C-11]M-PEPy binding in the olfactory bulb at 5 min. The feasibility of synthesizing high-affinity and high-selectivity ligands for mGluR5 receptors and their suitability as PET imaging ligands for mGluR5 receptors in vivo are demonstrated.

In radioligand binding (saturation or displacement) experiments, the affinities of a number of competitive antagonists were decreased by the modulators, with no change in receptor number. The binding curves of the partial agonist CGP47656 comprised a high and a low affinity component; the affinity of the former was increased by the allosteric agents. The maximal stimulation of GTP[gamma]S-35 binding via recombinant GABA(B) receptors by CGP47656 was increased 4-fold in the presence of 30 mu M CGP7930 or GS39783. Two compounds known so far as "silent" competitive GABAB receptor antagonists, CGP35348 and 2-OH-saclofen, did not stimulate GTP[gamma]S-35 binding on their own, but became low efficacy partial agonists in the presence of the two modulators. The potency of GABA to inhibit the formation of cAMP induced by a forskolin analog in a recombinant CHO cell line expressing GABAB receptors was increased by the modulators. CGP35348 and 2-OH-saclofen, like CGP47656, were partial agonists on their own in this assay, and the allosteric modulators increased the potency as well as the efficacy of all three compounds. With CGP52432, there was a trend towards inverse agonism in the cAMP assay. These results show that the intrinsic properties of orthosteric ligands are highly dependent on the characteristics of the assay system used and that allosteric modulators are useful tools for elucidating these properties.

Here we report on the first visualization of the A(2A)Rs in the human brain by PET and [C-11]TMSX in a male healthy volunteer, compared with the adenosine A, receptors (A(1)Rs) and dopamine D-2 receptors (D(2)Rs) which were measured by PET with [C-11]MPDX and [C-11]raclopride, respectively. The distribution volume (DV) of [C-11]TMSX in the baseline was relatively high in the head of caudate nucleus, putamen, and thalamus and relatively low in the cortical regions. Infusion of theophylline, a nonselective A(2A)R antagonist (K for A(2A)Rs = 16000 nM for theophylline vs 5.9 nM for TMSX), slightly reduced the DVs in the head of caudate nucleus (8.0% reduction) and putamen (4.5% reduction), but not in the other regions having much lower levels of A(2A)Rs, demonstrating the A(2A)R-specific binding of [C-11]TMSX. On the other hand, the A(1)Rs were widely distributed in the whole brain except for the cerebellum, while the binding potential of [C-11]raclopride was predominantly high in the striatum. We concluded that [C-11]TMSX is an applicable PET ligand for mapping the A(2A)Rs in the caudate nucleus and putamen in clinical studies because of no availability of other radioligands until now. The [C-11]TMSX PET is of great interest for studying the pathophysiology of neurological and psychiatric disorders together with the [C-11]raclopride PET for D(2)Rs evaluation and/or the [C-11]MPDX PET for A(1)Rs evaluation.

However, whether chronic oral T62 retains efficacy in this pain model has not been examined. Therefore, the authors studied antiallodynic effects of chronic oral T62 in spinal nerved-ligated rats, as wen as motor and sedative behavioral effects. Methods: Oral T62, 100 mg/kg, or oral oil was applied daily to spinal nerve-ligated rats for 4 weeks, with rat weights examined daily. Sedation, placing and ambulation scores, and withdrawal threshold were observed for 3 h daily for the first 2 weeks and then once a week. At the end of observation, the animals were killed, and the spinal tissues were collected for radioligand binding. in addition, withdrawal thresholds were also observed in rats with 5 days of treatment with 50 mg/kg oral T62. Furthermore, the effects of intrathecal adenosine on rats with oral T62 or oil treatment were compared. Results: Chronic oral T62, at 100 mg/kg, initially returned the withdrawal threshold to mechanical testing to preinjury levels, with minor or no sedative or motor effects. Tolerance was observed, with a 60% loss of most possible effects in antiallodynia within 5 days of daily administration. Similarly, tolerance also occurred with chronic oral T62 at 50 mg/kg but did not alter the effect of intrathecal adenosine. Furthermore, 4 weeks of exposure to 100 mg/kg T62 resulted in a small reduction in spinal cord A1 receptor number. Conclusion: The results imply that chronically administered At adenosine modulators lose efficacy over time, partly as a result of receptor down-regulation.

Levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) mimics acute dystonic reactionsinduced by antipsychotic agents, possibly mediated by sigma-receptors; however, there are few reports in which the relationship between a-receptors and LID in advanced PD is investigated. The binding potential of cerebellar sigma-receptors before and after a pallidal surgery for dyskinesia in patients with advanced PD is assessed. Methods. Six patients with advanced PD (male/female ratio 3:3, age 56.7 +/- 9.8 years) underwent stereotactic pallidal surgery (two posteroventral pallidotomy procedures and four deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus internus, including one bilateral case). Clinical features of patients with PD were assessed using Hoehn and Yahr (H & Y) stages, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), and the Schwab and England Activities of Daily Life Scale (S & E). The LID was evaluated by LID severity score. The binding potential of cerebellar sigma-receptors was determined before and after the Surgery by C-11-nemonapride positron emission tomoraphy, a specific radioligand for sigma-receptors in the cerebellum. All clinical scores, especially the LID severity score, were dramatically improved after the surgery (p < 0.05). Preoperatively, contralateral cerebellar binding potential was significantly elevated (p < 0.01), and it was reduced after the surgery, but it was still higher than that of healthy volunteers (p < 0.05). The ipsilateral cerebellar binding potential remained unchanged after the surgery. The level of binding potential did not correlate with H & Y stage, UPDRS, or S & E score, but a strong positive correlation was seen between the binding potential and the preoperative LID severity score when the patients were receiving medication (r = 0.893, p < 0.05). Conclusions. Cerebellar sigma-receptors may potentially involve the genesis of LID in advanced PD.

Transfection of GqGi3 into previously validated stable CHO cell lines expressing mGluR2 or mGluR4 allowed for the selection of new double transfectants in which application of L-glutamate and other mGluR agonists resulted in calcium coupling with a high signal:noise ratio (maximal changes in relative fluorescence units up to 20,000). The rank order of agonist potency for the stimulation of calcium mobilization in the mGluR2/GqGi3 stable cell line was LY354740 > L-CCG-I = DCG-IV > L-glutamate greater than or equal to (2R,4R)-APDC greater than or equal to (1S,3R)-ACPD. In the mGluR4/GqGi3 stable cell line the rank order of agonist potency was L-AP4 > L-SOP greater than or equal to ACPT-I = L-CCG-I greater than or equal to L-glutamate = (RS)-PPG. By comparison, equivalent potency orders and a significant correlation in functional activities were observed when the same compounds were profiled in [S-35]GTPgammaS binding assays for each mGluR subtype. These results validate the use of functional calcium assays, amenable to high-throughput applications on the fluorometric imaging plate reader, for the mGluR2 and mGluR4 subtypes when co-expressed in stable cell lines with the GqGi3 chimera.

Autoradiographic studies in control monkeys showed that 5-[I-125]A-85380 ([I-125] A-85380) binds throughout the brain with the characteristics of a nicotinic receptor ligand. Competition experiments with cytisine and nicotine yielded K-i values of similar to1 and 10 nM, respectively, with complete inhibition of [I-125] A-85380 binding at a 10(-6) M concentration of these ligands. In contrast, alpha-conotoxin MII blocked radioligand binding in the striatum by 30% at the highest concentrations, suggesting that a subset of striatal [I-125] A-85380 sites are alpha-conotoxin MII-sensitive. Monkeys treated with the nigrostriatal neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6- tetrahydropyridine showed a selective decrease in striatal [I-125] A-85380 sites, with a 42% reduction in the caudate and putamen of animals with moderate nigrostriatal lesioning and a 53% decline in the striatum of severely lesioned animals. Our previous work had demonstrated that there were two populations of nicotinic receptors eliminated after nigrostriatal damage, an alpha-conotoxin MII-sensitive and an alpha-conotoxin MII-resistant subtype. Analysis of both striatal [I-125] A-85380 and [I-125] epibatidine competition studies extend our earlier studies by demonstrating that the alpha-conotoxin MII- sensitive sites eliminated after moderate nigrostriatal lesioning appear to be composed of two nicotinic receptor subtypes. The data may be important for potential therapeutic approaches because they suggest that there are at least three populations of nicotinic receptors in monkey striatum, of which two are selectively vulnerable to nigrostriatal damage, while the third is more resistant.

Recently, we reported that human cancer cell lines express splice variants (SVs) of the receptors for GHRH. SV1 exhibits the greatest similarity to the pituitary GHRH receptor and is most likely to be functional. To ascertain whether SV1 mediates mitogenic effects on nonpituitary tissues, we expressed SV1 in 3T3 mouse fibroblasts and studied the properties of the transfected cells. Radioligand binding assays with I-125-labeled GHRH antagonist JV-1-42 detected high affinity (K-d = 0.58 +/- 0.17 nM) binding sites for GHRH with a maximal binding capacity (B-max) of 103 +/- 17.4 fmol/mg of membrane protein in 3T3 cells transfected with pcDNA3-SV1, whereas the control cells transfected with the empty vector did not show any GHRH binding. Cell proliferation studies showed that cells expressing SV1 are much more sensitive to GHRH analogs than the pcDNA3 controls. Thus, the expression of SV1 augments the stimulatory responses to GHRH(1-29)NH2 or GHRH agonist JI-38 and inhibitory responses to GHRH antagonist JV-1-38 as compared with pcDNA3 controls. The stimulation of SV1-expressing cells by GHRIH or JI-38 is followed by an increase in cAMP production, but no GH release occurs. Vasoactive intestinal peptide had no effect, and its antagonist JV-1-53 did not inhibit the proliferation of SV1-expressing cells stimulated by GHRH. Our results suggest that SV1 could mediate responses of nonpituitary cells and various tumors to GHRH and GHRIH antagonists. The presence of SV1 in several human cancer cell lines provides a rationale for antitumor therapy based on the blockade of this receptor by specific GHRH antagonists.

The objective of this study was to examine the effects of chronic prenatal ethanol exposure on the number of GABA(A) receptors and relative protein levels for GABA(A) receptor alpha1 and beta2/3 subunits in the adult guinea pig cerebral cortex. Timed pregnant Dunkin-Hartley strain guinea pigs were given one of the following oral treatments daily throughout gestation: 4 gm of ethanol per kilogram of maternal body weight, isocaloric-sucrose with pair feeding, or isovolumetric water with adlibitum access to food. The ethanol treatment resulted in a peak maternal blood ethanol concentration of 328 +/- 55 mg/dl (71.3 +/- 12.0 mM) on gestational day 57 (term, similar to 68 d). Chronic prenatal exposure to ethanol resulted in increased spontaneous locomotor activity throughout development and decreased cerebral cortical weight in adult offspring. The number of cerebral cortical [H-3] muscimol binding sites was increased in adult offspring from the ethanol treatment group, and there was a corresponding increase in the amount of GABA(A) receptor alpha1 and beta2/3 subunit proteins in these same animals. For individual offspring, there were correlations between locomotor activity and cerebral cortical weight, as well as between cerebral cortical weight and GABA(A) receptor neurochemistry. There was no effect of chronic prenatal ethanol exposure on [H-3] MK-801 binding in this tissue. These data demonstrate that chronic prenatal ethanol exposure has long-term consequences on the regulation of GABA(A) receptor expression in the cerebral cortex.

The differential distribution and function of these subtypes are responsible for the multiplicity of endothelin actions in this tissue. This study examines the regulatory effects of experimental diabetes on the gene expression, subtype specificity and localization of ET receptor subtypes, ET isopeptides, and endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1) in the rat adrenal gland. The densities, pharmacological properties and distribution of ET receptor subtypes ETA and ETB in adrenal glands from streptozotocin-induced diabetic, insulin-treated diabetic and age-matched control rats were investigated, using radioligand receptor binding and autoradiographic techniques. The gene expression of ETA and ETB receptors ET-1, ET-3 and ECE-1 was evaluated using relative multiplex reverse transcription/PCR. The induction of diabetes caused a marked reduction in body weight but no significant change in adrenal gland size. The density of ET receptors was significantly increased in the diabetic rat adrenal gland, mainly because of an increase in the expression of ETB receptors. Insulin treatment normalized the diabetes-induced changes in the expression levels of ET receptor subtypes to control levels. The expression level of ET-1 mRNA was up-regulated, whereas ET-3 mRNA was down-regulated in the diabetic adrenal gland compared with the controls. The ECE-1 mRNA level in the adrenal gland was not altered by the induction of diabetes. Autoradiographic studies showed that ETA and ETB are the predominant receptor subtypes in the adrenal medulla and cortex respectively. These results suggest that ETA and ETB receptors are differentially distributed and regulated in the diabetic rat adrenal gland.

Species differences in neurokinin 3 (NK3) receptor pharmacology have led to the preferential use of guinea pigs and gerbils in the characterization of non-peptide NK3 antagonists. Little is known about the central localization of NK3 receptors in the CNS of these species. To study this, [H-3]senktide and [H-3]SR 142801 were used in autoradiography experiments to visualize the NK3 receptors in the guinea pig and gerbil brain and compared to with the distribution of [H-3]senktide binding sites in the rat brain. In the three species, the NK3 receptor was similarly distributed within the cerebral cortex, the zona incerta, the medial habenula, the amygdaloid complex, the superior colliculus and the interpeduncular nucleus. Outside of these structures, our study has revealed that each species displayed a specific distribution pattern of central NK3 receptors. The rat was the only species where NK3 receptors could be visualized in the striatum, the supraoptic nucleus and the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. The guinea pig differed mainly from the two other species by the absence of detectable binding sites in the substantia nigra pars compacta and the ventral tegmental area. A specific localization of NK3 receptors in the anterodorsal and anteroventral thalamic nuclei characterized the gerbil. This last species is also unique by in the higher level of NK3 receptors in the dorsal and median raphe nuclei. All these differences suggest that the NK3 receptor mediates different functions in different species. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The ability of SC17599 to interact with opioid receptors has been studied using radioligand and [S-35]guanosine-5'-O-(3-thio) triphosphate (GTP gamma S) binding assays. SC17599 bound to mu-opioid receptors in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and to recombinant receptors expressed in rat C6 glioma cells and Chinese hamster ovary cells with good affinity and with greater than 100-fold selectivity for mu- over both delta- and kappa-opioid receptors. Binding was much reduced when aspartate 147 in the wild-type mu-opioid receptor was replaced with asparagine. The affinity of SC17599 for the mu-opioid receptor was decreased in the presence of sodium ions, indicating agonist activity. SC17599 stimulated the binding of [S-35]GTP gamma S in a naloxone-reversible manner with good potency and maximal effect equivalent to that of the mu-opioid agonists fentanyl and [D-Ala(2),N-Me-Phe(4),Gly(5)-ol]-enkephalin. In rat brain membranes, SC17599-mediated stimulation of [S-35]GTP gamma S binding was reversed by the antagonist naltrexone. SC17599 lacks an aromatic ring and para-hydroxyl substituent considered critical in the pharmacophore for mu-opioids. The structural relationship between SC17599 and more traditional opioid ligands was investigated through genetic algorithm-based modeling techniques for pharmacophore generation (GASP) and ligand-receptor docking (GOLD). The relatively planar and electron-rich A ring of the steroid compensated for the lack of aromaticity. Modeling of ligand-receptor docking showed that both morphine and SC17599 occupy the same binding pocket within the transmembrane helix bundle of the mu-opioid receptor and that the relationship between their binding modes largely mimicked the pharmacophore alignment.

Previous results in a rat lesion model of AD showed modulation of endocannabinoid receptor activity in the basalo-cortical pathway following a specific lesion of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs), indicating that the glial neuroinflammatory response accompanying the lesion is related to endocannabinoid signaling. In this study, 7 days after the lesion, decreased astrocyte and increased microglia immunoreactivities (GFAP and Iba-1) were observed, indicating microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. Using autoradio-graphic studies, the density and functional coupling to G-proteins of endocannabinoid receptor subtypes were studied in tissue sections from different brain areas where microglia density increased, using CB1 and CB2 selective agonists and antagonists. In the presence of the specific CB1 receptor antagonist, SR141716A, [3H]CP55,940 binding (receptor density) was completely blocked in a dose-dependent manner, while the selective CB2 receptor antagonist, SR144528, inhibited binding to 25%, at best. [35S]GTP gamma S autoradiography (receptor coupling to G(i/0)-proteins) evoked by CP55,940 (CB1/CB2 agonist) and HU308 (more selective for CB2) was abolished by SR141716A in all areas, while SR144528 blocked up to 51.8% of the coupling to G(i/0)-proteins evoked by CP55,940 restricted to the nucleus basalis magnocellularis. Together, these results demonstrate that there are increased microglia and decreased astrocyte immunoreactivities 1 week after a specific deletion of BFCNs, which projects to cortical areas, where the CB1 receptor coupling to G(i/0)-proteins is upregulated. However, at the lesion site, the area with the highest neuroinflammatory response, there is also a limited contribution of CB2.

Specific and non-specific binding of a tracer for the translocator-specific protein in schizophrenia: an [11C]-PBR28 blocking study	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						TSPO; Schizophrenia; Microglia; XBD173		Objective The mitochondrial 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) is expressed by activated microglia and positron emission tomography enables the measurement of TSPO levels in the brain. Findings in schizophrenia have shown to vary depending on the outcome measure used and this discrepancy in TSPO results could be explained by lower non-displaceable binding (V-ND) in schizophrenia, which could obscure increases in specific binding. In this study, we have used the TSPO ligand XBD173 to block the TSPO radioligand [C-11]-PBR28 and used an occupancy plot to quantify V-ND in patients with schizophrenia. Methods A total of 7 patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia were recruited for this study. Each patient received two separate PET scans with [C-11]PBR28, one at baseline and one after the administration of the TSPO ligand XBD173. All patients were high-affinity binders (HABs) for the TSPO gene. We used an occupancy plot to quantify the non-displaceable component (V-ND) using 2TCM kinetic estimates with and without vascular correction. Finally we computed the V-ND at a single subject level using the SIME method. Results All patients showed a global and generalized reduction in [C-11]PBR28 uptake after the administration of XBD173. Constraining the V-ND to be equal for all patients, the population V-ND was estimated to be 1.99 mL/cm(3) (95% CI 1.90 to 2.08). When we used vascular correction, the fractional TSPO occupancy remained similar. Conclusions In schizophrenia patients, a substantial component of the [C-11]PBR28 signal represents specific binding to TSPO. Furthermore, the V-ND in patients with schizophrenia is similar to that previously reported in healthy controls. These results suggest that changes in non-specific binding between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls do not account for discrepant PET findings in this disorder.

We hypothesize higher amyloid levels among APOE epsilon 4 carriers vs APOE epsilon 4 noncarriers. Methods This is a cross-sectional study in a community-based sample of 249 middle-aged Hispanics in New York City who underwent a 3T brain MRI and PET with the amyloid radioligand F-18-florbetaben. APOE genotype was the primary exposure. The primary outcome was amyloid positivity. The secondary outcome was subthreshold amyloid levels examined as a continuous variable. Results APOE epsilon 4 carriers (n = 85) had a higher frequency (15.3%) of amyloid positivity compared to APOE epsilon 4 noncarriers (n = 164, 1.8%). In the subthreshold group of amyloid-negative participants (n = 233), APOE epsilon 4 carriers (n = 72) had a 0.02 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01-0.04) higher global brain amyloid standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) compared to APOE epsilon 4 noncarriers (n = 161). Compared to participants with the epsilon 3/epsilon 3 genotype, participants with epsilon 4/epsilon 4 had the highest frequency of amyloid positivity (28.6%), followed by those with epsilon 3/epsilon 4 (11%). Among amyloid-negative participants (n = 233), compared to participants with epsilon 3/epsilon 3 (n = 134), those with epsilon 4/epsilon 4 (n = 5) had a 0.12 (95% CI 0.07-0.17) higher global brain amyloid SUVR, and those with epsilon 3/epsilon 4 had a 0.02 higher SUVR (95% CI 0.003-0.04). Results were similar when a median split was used for elevated amyloid, when continuous amyloid SUVR was analyzed in all participants, and in nonparametric Mann-Whitney comparisons. Conclusion Middle-aged Hispanic APOE epsilon 4 carriers have higher in vivo brain amyloid burden compared with noncarriers, as reported in non-Hispanics.

Osteopontin/secreted phosphoprotein-1 behaves as a molecular brake regulating the neuroinflammatory response to chronic viral infection	JOURNAL OF NEUROINFLAMMATION			English	Article						Neuroimaging; Neuroinflammation; Microglial activation; DPA-713; Purkinje cells; Human immunodeficiency virus type-1; Peripheral benzodiazepine receptor; Positron emission tomography; RNAscope; Ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1	PROGRESSIVE HIV-1 INFECTION; TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN; MICE LACKING; BRAIN; MICROGLIA; PET; EXPRESSION; PATHOGENESIS; MACROPHAGES; ACTIVATION	Background Osteopontin (OPN) as a secreted signaling protein is dramatically induced in response to cellular injury and neurodegeneration. Microglial inflammatory responses in the brain are tightly associated with the neuropathologic hallmarks of neurodegenerative disease, but understanding of the molecular mechanisms remains in several contexts poorly understood. Methods Micro-positron emission tomography (PET) neuroimaging using radioligands to detect increased expression of the translocator protein (TSPO) receptor in the brain is a non-invasive tool used to track neuroinflammation in living mammals. Results In humanized, chronically HIV-infected female mice in which OPN expression was knocked down with functional aptamers, uptake of TSPO radioligand DPA-713 was markedly upregulated in the cortex, olfactory bulb, basal forebrain, hypothalamus, and central grey matter compared to controls. Microglia immunoreactive for Iba-1 were more abundant in some HIV-infected mice, but overall, the differences were not significant between groups. TSPO(+)microglia were readily detected by immunolabeling of post-mortem brain tissue and unexpectedly, two types of neurons also selectively stained positive for TSPO. The reactive cells were the specialized neurons of the cerebellum, Purkinje cells, and a subset of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons of the substantia nigra. Conclusions In female mice with wild-type levels of osteopontin, increased levels of TSPO ligand uptake in the brain was seen in animals with the highest levels of persistent HIV replication. In contrast, in mice with lower levels of osteopontin, the highest levels of TSPO uptake was seen, in mice with relatively low levels of persistent infection. These findings suggest that osteopontin may act as a molecular brake regulating in the brain, the inflammatory response to HIV infection.

Among 5-HT receptors, 5-HT2A receptor subtype seems to be an important target implicated in the above disorder. Methods: The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of antidepressants, such as imipramine (15 mg/kg), escitalopram (10 mg/kg) and tianeptine (10 mg/kg) as well as drugs with antidepressant activity, including N-acetylcysteine (100 mg/kg) and URB597 (a fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitor, 0.3 mg/kg) on the 5-HT2A receptor labeling pattern in selected rat brain regions. Following acute or chronic (14 days) drug administration, rat brains were analyzed by using autoradiography with the 5HT(2A) receptor antagonist [H-3]ketanserin. Results: Single dose or chronic administration of imipramine decreased the radioligand binding in the claustrum and cortical subregions. The [H-3]ketanserin binding either increased or decreased in cortical areas after acute N-acetylcysteine and URB597 administration, respectively. A similar shift towards reduction of the [H-3]ketanserin binding was detected in the nucleus accumbens shell following either acute treatment with imipramine, escitalopram, N-acetylcysteine and URB597 or repeated administration of imipramine, tianeptine and URB597. Conclusions: In conclusion, the present result indicate different sensitivity of brain 5-HT2A receptors to antidepressant drugs depending on schedule of drug administration and rat brain regions. The decrease of accumbal shell 5-HT2A receptor labeling by antidepressant drugs exhibiting different primary mechanism of action seems to be a common targeting mechanism associated with the outcome of depression treatment.

Methods We synthesized 14 new PSMA-targeted, Lu-177-labeled radioligands (Lu-177-L1-Lu-177-L14) using different chelating agents and linkers. We evaluated them in vitro using human prostate cancer PSMA(+) PC3 PIP and PSMA(-) PC3 flu cells and in corresponding flank tumor models. Efficacy and toxicity after 8 weeks were evaluated at a single administration of 111 MBq for Lu-177-L1, Lu-177-L3, Lu-177-L5 and Lu-177-PSMA-617. Efficacy of Lu-177-L1 was further investigated using different doses, and long-term toxicity was determined in healthy immunocompetent mice. Results Radioligands were produced in high radiochemical yield and purity. Cell uptake and internalization indicated specific uptake only in PSMA(+) PC3 cells. Lu-177-L1, Lu-177-L3 and Lu-177-L5 demonstrated comparable uptake to Lu-177-PSMA-617 and Lu-177-PSMA-I&T in PSMA-expressing tumors up to 72 h post-injection. Lu-177-L1, Lu-177-L3 and Lu-177-L5 also demonstrated efficient tumor regression at 8 weeks. Lu-177-L1 enabled the highest survival rate. Necropsy studies of the treated group at 8 weeks revealed subacute damage to lacrimal glands and testes. No radiation nephropathy was observed 1 year post-treatment in healthy mice receiving 111 MBq of Lu-177-L1, most likely related to the fast renal clearance of this agent. Conclusions Lu-177-L1 is a viable clinical candidate for radionuclide therapy of PSMA-expressing malignancies because of its high tumor-targeting ability and low off-target radiotoxic effects.

These chimeric molecules consist of YGGF sequence, a crucial motif in the N-terminus of natural opioid peptides, and Ac-RYYRIK-NH2, which was isolated from a combinatorial peptide library as an antagonist or partial agonist that inhibits the biological activity of the endogenously occurring heptadecapeptide nociceptin. Solution structures for the peptides were studied by analysing their circular dichroism spectra. Receptor binding affinities were measured by equilibrium competition experiments using four highly selective radioligands. G-protein activating properties of the multitarget peptides were estimated in [S-35] GTP gamma S binding tests. The three compounds were also measured in electrically stimulated mouse vas deferens (MVD) bioassay. H-YGGFGGGRYYRIK-NH2 (BA55), carrying N-terminal opioid and C-terminal nociceptin-like sequences interconnected with GGG tripeptide spacer displayed a tendency of having either unordered or beta-sheet structures, was moderately potent in MVD and possessed a NOP/KOP receptor preference. A similar peptide without spacer H-YGGFRYYRIK-NH2 (BA62) exhibited the weakest effect in MVD, more a-helical periodicity was present in its structure and it exhibited the most efficacious agonist actions in the G-protein stimulation assays. The third hybrid peptide Ac-RYYRIKGGGYGGFL-OH (BA61) unexpectedly displayed opioid receptor affinities, because the opioid message motif is hidden within the C-terminus. The designed chimeric peptide ligands presented in this study accommodate well into a group of multitarget opioid compounds that include opioid-non-opioid peptide dimer analogues, dual non-peptide dimers and mixed peptide- non-peptide bifunctional ligands.

Metyrapone prevents brain damage induced by status epilepticus in the rat lithium-pilocarpine model	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Seizure; Glucocorticoids; Metyrapone; Lithium-pilocarpine model; [18F]FDG PET; [18F]GE180	PROLONGED GLUCOCORTICOID EXPOSURE; CHRONIC EPILEPSY; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; INDUCED SEIZURES; TIME-COURSE; IN-VIVO; HYPOMETABOLISM; STRESS; EPILEPTOGENESIS; CORTICOSTERONE	The status epilepticus (SE) induced by lithium-pilocarpine is a well characterized rodent model of the human temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) which is accompanied by severe brain damage. Stress and gluco-corticoids markedly contribute to exacerbate neuronal damage induced by seizures but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Herein we sought to investigate whether a single administration of metyrapone (150 mg/kg, i.p.), an 11 beta-hydroxylase inhibitor, enzyme involved in the peripheral and central synthesis of corticosteroids, had neuroprotective properties in this model. Two experiments were carried out. In exp. I, metyrapone was administered 3 h before pilocarpine injection whereas in exp. 2, metyrapone administration took place at the onset of the SE. In both experiments, 3 days after the insult, brain metabolism was assessed by in vivo 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-D-glucose ([F-18]FDG) positron emission tomography (PET). Brains were processed for analyses of markers of hippocampal integrity (Nissl staining), neurodegeneration (Fluoro-Jade C), astrogliosis (glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunohistochemistry) and, for a marker of activated microglia by in vitro autoradiography with the TSPO (18 kDa translocator protein) radioligand [F-18]GE180. The SE resulted in a consistent hypometabolism in hippocampus, cortex and striatum and neuronal damage, hippocampal neurodegeneration, neuronal death and gliosis. Interestingly, metyrapone had neuroprotective effects when administered before, but not after the insult. In summary, we conclude that metyrapone administration prior but not after the SE protected from brain damage induced by SE in the lithium-pilocarpine model. Therefore, it seems that the effect of metyrapone is preventive in nature and likely related to its antiseizure properties. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Due to the inherent imprecision of single voxel measurements, spatial smoothing is performed to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of single-voxel estimates. In addition, smoothing compensates for imprecisions in anatomical registration, and allows for the use of cluster-based statistical thresholding. Smoothing has traditionally been applied in three dimensions, without taking the tissue types of surrounding voxels into account. This procedure may be suitable for subcortical structures, but is problematic for cortical regions for which grey matter often constitutes only a small proportion of the smoothed signal. New methods have been developed for cortical analysis in which voxels are sampled to a surface, and smoothing is restricted to neighbouring regions along the cortical grey matter in two dimensions. This procedure has recently been shown to decrease intersubject variability and bias of PET data. The aim of this study was to compare the variability, bias and test-retest reliability of volumetric and surface-based methods as they are applied in practice. Fifteen healthy young males were each measured twice using the dopamine D1 receptor radioligand [C-11] SCH-23390, and analyses were performed at the level of individual voxels and vertices within the cortex. We found that surface-based methods yielded higher BPND values, lower coefficient of variation, less bias, better reliability and more precise estimates of parametric binding. All in all, these results suggest that surface-based methods exhibit superior performance to volumetric approaches for voxelwise analysis of PET data, and we advocate for their use when a ROI-based analysis is not appropriate.

Alternative Radioligands for Investigating the Molecular Pharmacology of Melatonin Receptors	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							BINDING-SITES; MT1; BRAIN; AGOMELATINE; CLONING; ANTIDEPRESSANT; DERIVATIVES; LIGANDS; RETINA; LIGHT	Melatonin exerts a variety of physiologic activities that are mainly relayed through the melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 Low expressions of these receptors in tissues have led to widespread experimental use of the agonist 2-[I-125]-iodomelatonin as a substitute for melatonin. We describe three iodinated ligands: 2-(2-[(2-iodo-4,5-dimethoxyphenyl)methyl]-4,5-dimethoxy phenyl) (DIV880) and (2-iodo-N-2-[5-methoxy-2-(naphthalen-1-yl)1H-pyrrolo[3,2-b]pyridine-3-yl])acetamide (S70254), which are specific ligands at MT2 receptors, and N-[2-(5-methoxy-1H-indol-3-yl) ethyl]iodoacetamide (SD6), an analog of 2-[I-125]iodomelatonin with slightly different characteristics. Here, we further characterized these new ligands with regards to their molecular pharmacology. We performed binding experiments, saturation assays, association/dissociation rate measurements, and autoradiography using sheep and rat tissues and recombinant cell lines. Our results showed that [I-125]-S70254 is receptor, and can be used with both cells and tissue. This radioligand can be used in autoradiography. Similarly, DIV880, a partial agonist [43% of melatonin on guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate binding assay], selective for MT2, can be used as a tool to selectively describe the pharmacology of this receptor in tissue samples. The molecular pharmacology of both human melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2, using a series of 24 ligands at these receptors and the new radioligands, did not lead to noticeable variations in the profiles. For the first time, we described radiolabeled tools that are specific for one of the melatonin receptors (MT2).

Resolvin D2 Supports MCF-7 Cell Proliferation via Activation of Estrogen Receptor	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							LIGAND-INDEPENDENT ACTIVATION; BREAST-CANCER; INFLAMMATION; RESOLUTION; EXPRESSION; D1; PHOSPHORYLATION; MEDIATORS; PATHWAYS; SURVIVAL	Inflammation has been implicated in tumor initiation, angiogenesis, and metastasis, and linked to the development of more aggressive, therapy-resistant estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. Resolvin D2 (RvD2) is a potent anti-inflammatory lipid mediator. As RvD2 may be synthesized within breast tumors by both tumor cells and the surrounding stroma cells and is present in plasma at bioactive concentrations, we sought to characterize the impact of RvD2 on cell processes underlying breast tumor growth and spread. Trypan-blue exclusion, transfection with estrogen response element (ERE) reporter, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, competitive radioligand binding assays, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence were the techniques used. Unexpectedly, whereas RvD2 (10-1000 nM) supported the proliferation of the ER-positive breast tumor (MCF-7) cells, it did not affect the ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cell number. The proliferative effect of RvD2 in MCF-7 cells was attenuated by the ER antagonist ICI 182,780 (7 alpha-[9-[(4,4,5,5,5-pentafluoropentyl)sulfinyl]nonyl]estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17 beta-diol). Furthermore, RvD2 increased ERE transcriptional activity in a number of ER-positive breast and ovarian tumor cell lines. This activation was also inhibited by ICI 182,780. RvD2 altered the expression of a subset of estrogen-responsive genes. Although binding experiments showed that RvD2 did not directly compete with [H-3]17 beta-estradiol for ER binding, prior exposure of MCF-7 cells to RvD2 resulted in a significant reduction in the apparent cytosolic ER density. Confocal immunocytochemistry and Western blotting studies showed that RvD2 promoted nuclear localization of ER alpha. These observations indicate that RvD2 displays significant but indirect estrogenic properties and has the potential to play a role in estrogen-dependent breast cancer progression.

Parametric Imaging and Test-Retest Variability of <SUP>11</SUP>C-(+)-PHNO Binding to D<sub>2</sub>/D<sub>3</sub> Dopamine Receptors in Humans on the High-Resolution Research Tomograph PET Scanner	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						dopamine D2 receptor; dopamine D3 receptor; agonist; positron emission tomography; test-retest study	REFERENCE TISSUE MODEL; D-3 RECEPTOR; RADIOTRACER; AFFINITY; BRAIN; D3	C-11-(+)-4-propyl-9-hydroxynaphthoxazine (C-11-(+)-PHNO) is an agonist radioligand for imaging dopamine D-2 and D-3 receptors in the human brain with PET. In this study we evaluated the reproducibility of C-11-(+)-PHNO binding parameters using a within-day design and assessed parametric imaging methods. Methods: Repeated studies were performed in 8 subjects, with simultaneous measurement of the arterial input function and plasma free fraction. Two C-11-(+)-PHNO scans for the same subject were separated by 5.4 +/- 0.7 h. After compartment models were evaluated, C-11-(+)-PHNO volumes of distribution (V-T) and binding potentials relative to the concentration of tracer in plasma (BPP), nondisplaceable tracer in tissue (BPND), and free tracer in tissue (BPF) were quantified using the multilinear analysis MA1 method, with the cerebellum as the reference region. Parametric images of BPND were also computed using the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) and SRTM2. Results: The test-retest variability of C-11-(+)-PHNO BPND was 9% in D-2-rich regions (caudate and putamen). Among D-3-rich regions, variability was low in the pallidum (6%) but higher in substantia nigra (19%), thalamus (14%), and hypothalamus (21%). No significant mass carry-over effect was observed in D-3-rich regions, although a trend in BPND was present in the substantia nigra (-14% +/- 15%). Because of the relatively fast kinetics, low-noise BPND parametric images were obtained with both SRTM and SRTM2 without spatial smoothing. Conclusion: C-11-(+)-PHNO can be used to compute low-noise parametric images in both D-2- and D-3-rich regions in humans.

Differential regulation of muscarinic M<sub>2</sub> and M<sub>3</sub> receptor signaling in gastrointestinal smooth muscle by caveolin-1	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-CELL PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						caveolin-1; gastric emptying; internalization; muscarinic receptors; smooth muscle	ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR; LIPID RAFTS; INTESTINAL MUSCLE; CARDIAC MYOCYTES; ADENYLYL-CYCLASE; PHOSPHOLIPASE-C; URINARY-BLADDER; CELL BIOLOGY; CONTRACTION; PHOSPHORYLATION	Caveolae act as scaffolding proteins for several G protein-coupled receptor signaling molecules to regulate their activity. Caveolin-1, the predominant isoform in smooth muscle, drives the formation of caveolae. The precise role of caveolin-1 and caveolae as scaffolds for G protein-coupled receptor signaling and contraction in gastrointestinal muscle is unclear. Thus the aim of this study was to examine the role of caveolin-1 in the regulation of G(q)- and G(i)-coupled receptor signaling. RT-PCR, Western blot, and radioligand-binding studies demonstrated the selective expression of M-2 and M-3 receptors in gastric smooth muscle cells. Carbachol (CCh) stimulated phosphatidylinositol (PI) hydrolysis, Rho kinase and zipper-interacting protein (ZIP) kinase activity, induced myosin phosphatase 1 (MYPT1) phosphorylation (at Thr(696)) and 20-kDa myosin light chain (MLC20) phosphorylation (at Ser(19)) and muscle contraction, and inhibited cAMP formation. Stimulation of PI hydrolysis, Rho kinase, and ZIP kinase activity, phosphorylation of MYPT1 and MLC20, and muscle contraction in response to CCh were attenuated by methyl beta-cyclodextrin (M beta CD) or caveolin-1 small interfering RNA (siRNA). Similar inhibition of PI hydrolysis, Rho kinase, and ZIP kinase activity and muscle contraction in response to CCh and gastric emptying in vivo was obtained in caveolin-1-knockout mice compared with wild-type mice. Agonist-induced internalization of M-2, but not M-3, receptors was blocked by M beta CD or caveolin-1 siRNA. Stimulation of PI hydrolysis, Rho kinase, and ZIP kinase activities in response to other G(q)-coupled receptor agonists such as histamine and substance P was also attenuated by M beta CD or caveolin-1 siRNA. Taken together, these results suggest that caveolin-1 facilitates signaling by G(q)-coupled receptors and contributes to enhanced smooth muscle function.

We previously reported that in addition to its antipsychotic action, lurasidone shows beneficial effects on mood and cognition in rats, likely through 5-HT7 receptor antagonistic actions. In this study, we evaluated binding of lurasidone to 5-HT7 receptors in the rat brain by autoradiography using [H-3]SB-269970, a specific radioligand for 5-HT7 receptors. Brain slices were incubated with 4 nM [H-3]SB-269970 at room temperature and exposed to imaging plates for 8 weeks before phosphorimager analysis. Using this method, we first investigated 5-HT7 receptor distribution. We found that 5-HT7 receptors are abundantly localized in brain limbic structures, including the lateral septum, thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala. On the other hand, its distribution was moderate in the cortex and low in the caudate putamen and cerebellum. Secondly, binding of lurasidone, a selective 5-HT7 receptor antagonist SB-656104-A and an atypical antipsychotic olanzapine to this receptor was examined. Lurasidone, SB-656104-A (10-1000 nM), and olanzapine (100-10,000 nM) showed concentration-dependent inhibition of [H-3]SB-269970 binding with IC50 values of 90, 49, and 5200 nM, respectively. Similar inhibitory actions of these drugs were shown in in vitro [H-3]SB-269970 binding to 5-HT7 receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Since there was no marked species difference in rat and human 5-HT7 receptor binding by lurasidone (K-i = 1.55 and 2.10 nM, respectively), these findings suggest that binding to 5-HT7 receptors might play some role in its beneficial pharmacological actions in schizophrenic patients.

Methods: Six healthy subjects (three males and three females) were enrolled in this study. An average of 160.8 MBq of [F-18] FACT was intravenously administered, and then a series of whole-body PET scans were performed. Nineteen male and 20 female source organs, and the remainder of the body, were studied to estimate time-integrated activity coefficients. The mean absorbed dose in each target organ and the effective dose were estimated from the time-integrated activity coefficients in the source organs. Biodistribution data from [F-18] FACT in mice were also used to estimate absorbed doses and the effective dose in human subjects; this was compared with doses of [F-18] FACT estimated from human PET data. Results: The highest mean absorbed doses estimated using human PET data were observed in the gallbladder (333 +/- 251 mu Gy/MBq), liver (77.5 +/- 14.5 mu Gy/MBq), small intestine (33.6 +/- 30.7 mu Gy/MBq), upper large intestine (29.8 +/- 15.0 mu Gy/MBq) and lower large intestine (25.2 +/- 12.6 mu Gy/MBq). The average effective dose estimated from human PET data was 18.6 +/- 3.74 mu Sv/MBq. The highest mean absorbed dose value estimated from the mouse data was observed in the small intestine (38.5 mu Gy/MBq), liver (25.5 mu Gy/MBq) and urinary bladder wall (43.1 mu Gy/MBq). The effective dose estimated from the mouse data was 14.8 mu Sv/MBq for [F-18] FACT. Conclusions: The estimated effective dose from the human PET data indicated that the [F-18] FACT PET study was acceptable for clinical purposes.

Ligand-Specific Roles for Transmembrane 5 Serine Residues in the Binding and Efficacy of Dopamine D<sub>1</sub> Receptor Catechol Agonists	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							SITE-DIRECTED MUTAGENESIS; BETA-ADRENERGIC-RECEPTOR; AMINO-ACIDS; ACTIVATION; POTENT; D1; IDENTIFICATION; SELECTIVITY	To refine further the structure-activity relationships of D-1 dopamine receptor agonists, we investigated the roles of three conserved serine residues [Ser198(5.42), Ser199(5.43), and Ser202(5.46)] in agonist binding and receptor activation. These transmembrane domain 5 (TM5) residues are believed to engage catechol ligands through polar interactions. We stably expressed wild-type or mutant (S198A, S199A, and S202A) D-1 receptors in human embryonic kidney cells. These receptors were expressed at similar levels (approximately 2000 fmol/mg) and bound the radioligand [H-3]R(+)-7-chloro-8-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine (SCH 23390), although S198A and S199A displayed significant losses of affinity compared with that for wild-type receptors. The endogenous agonist, dopamine, had losses of potency at each of the mutant receptors. We tested cyclohexyl-substituted isochroman, carbocyclic, and chroman bicyclic dopamine analogs and found that the mutations affected the chroman to a lesser extent than the other compounds. These results support our hypothesis that the decreased D-1 activity of chroman analogs results from a ligand intramolecular hydrogen bond that impairs the ability of the catechol to engage the receptor. Sensitivities of these rigid catechol agonists to the effects of the serine mutations were dependent on ligand geometry, particularly with respect to the rotameric conformation of the ethylamine side chain and the distance between the amino group and each catechol hydroxyl. Functional experiments in striatal tissue suggest that the ability to engage TM5 serines is largely correlated with agonist efficacy for cAMP stimulation. These results provide a new understanding of the complexities of D-1 ligand recognition and agonist activation and have implications for the design of rigid catechol ligands.

[C-11](+)-PHNO is the first preferential D-3 receptor radioligand in humans, yet there are no blockade studies with a D-3 receptor antagonist in humans. This study characterized the blockade of [C-11](+))-PHNO binding by ABT-925, a D-3 receptor antagonist, in healthy male subjects. Sixteen subjects underwent 2-3 positron emission tomography (PET) scans, at baseline and following one or two doses of ABT-925 ranging from 50 mg to 600 mg. Receptor occupancies were estimated for globus pallidus, substantia nigra, caudate, putamen, and ventral striatum. At the 600-mg dose (n=9), ABT-925 receptor occupancy (mean +/- S.D.) was higher in substantia nigra (75 +/- 10%) and globus pallidus (64 +/- 22%) than in ventral striatum (44 +/- 17%), caudate (40 +/- 18%) and putamen (38 +/- 17%) (ANOVA: F-4,F-140 = 15.02, p<0.001). The fractions of [C-11](+)-PHNO binding attributable to D-3 receptors in D-3 receptor-rich regions were 100% (substantia nigra) and 90% (globus pallidus), and in D-2 receptor-rich regions were 55% (caudate) and 53% (putamen). The ED50 of ABT-925 was 4.37 mu g/ml across regions. Our results demonstrate that [C-11](+)-PHNO binding can be blocked by a D-3 receptor antagonist and confirm preclinical findings that [C-11](+)-PHNO signal in the substantia nigra and globus pallidus is mainly reflective of its binding to D-3 receptors. Thus, [C-11](+)-PHNO seems a suitable PET radiotracer to estimate D-3 receptor occupancy in humans.

Positron Emission Tomography Quantification of Serotonin-1A Receptor Binding in Medication-Free Bipolar Depression	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Bipolar; depression; positron emission tomography (PET); 5-HT1A receptor; serotonin	5-HT1A RECEPTORS; 1A RECEPTOR; MAJOR DEPRESSION; TREATMENT RESPONSE; SUICIDE VICTIMS; RATING-SCALE; BRAIN; PET; POLYMORPHISM; DISORDER	Background: Little is known about the serotonin-1A receptor (5-HT1A) in bipolar depression despite altered 5-HT1A binding in major depressive disorder. Utilizing positron emission tomography (PET) and the radioligand N-(2-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl)ethyl)-N-(2-pyridinyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide ([Carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635), 5-HT1A binding was compared between depressed bipolar disorder (BD) and controls. Methods: Brain 5-HT1A binding potential (BPF = B-max/K-D, where B-max = total available receptors, and 1/K-D = ligand affinity) was measured in 32 currently depressed, medication-free BD subjects and 47 controls. Participants were genotyped for the 5-HT1A promoter polymorphism C(-1019)G. Results: The bipolar depressed group demonstrated higher 5-HT1A BPF across all regions of interest (ROIs; p = .022). Post hoc analyses indicated that male BD patients had higher 5-HT1A BPF than male controls (p = .025), with higher 5-HT1A BPF found in every region (by 102% in raphe nuclei and 29% to 50% in the forebrain ROIs); whereas, female subgroups did not differ in 5-HT1A BPF (p = 32). Serotonin-1A BPF did not correlate with depression severity. The GG genotype was overrepresented at trend level in the BD group (p = .057). Number of G-allele copies was associated with higher 5-HT1A BPF in raphe (p = .0050), amygdala (p = .022), and hippocampus (p = .041). Conclusions: Higher 5-HT1A BPF in bipolar depressed males suggests higher raphe autoreceptor binding, potentially causing less serotonin release and compensatory upregulation of forebrain postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors. The raphe effect may be partly genetic. No difference in 5-HT1A BPF, between BD and control females may reflect greater effect of prior antidepressant exposure in BD females.

Effects of chronic opioid exposure on guinea pig mu opioid receptor in Chinese hamster ovary cells: Comparison with human and rat receptor	BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	36th Annual Meeting of the Society-for-Neuroscience	OCT, 2006	Atlanta, GA	Soc Neurosci		G protein coupled receptor; down-regulation; desensitization; GTP gamma S binding; morphine; methadone	SH-SY5Y CELLS; CHO-CELLS; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; MORPHINE; DESENSITIZATION; INTERNALIZATION; BRAIN; TOLERANCE; BINDING; EFFICACY	Chronic opioid treatment leads to agonist-specific effects at the mu opioid receptor. The molecular mechanisms resulting from chronic opioid exposure include desensitization, internalization and down-regulation of membrane-bound mu opioid receptors (MOP). The purpose of this study was to compare the cellular regulation of guinea pig, human and rat MOP expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, following exposure to two clinically important opioids, morphine and methadone. MOP expressing CHO cells were treated in culture with methadone or morphine for up to 48 h. Radioligand diprenorphine and [D-AIa(2),N-Me-Phe(4),Gly(5)-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO)-stimulated GTP gamma S binding assays were carried out using paired control and opioid-exposed CHO cells. Methadone induced down-regulation of the mu opioid receptor, while morphine induced desensitization of the receptor for all three species. Furthermore, morphine predominantly decreased the potency of DAMGO to stimulate GTP gamma S binding, whereas methadone primarily reduced its efficacy. Changes in DAMGO potency and efficacy differed among species and depended on the opioid used to treat the cells. Our results showed similarities between guinea pig and human MOP for morphine-induced desensitization, but identified differences between the two for methadone-induced desensitization. In contrast, human and rat MOP differed in response to morphine treatment, but were not distinct in their response to methadone treatment. The guinea pig is an excellent and established animal model to study opioid effects, but its molecular opioid pharmacology has not been investigated thus far. These results can assist in understanding species differences in the effects of opioid ligands activating the mu opioid receptor. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Despite extensive characterization, neither the improgan receptor, nor a pharmacological antagonist of improgan has been previously described. Presently, the specific binding of [3 H]cimetidine (3HCIM) in brain fractions was used to discover 4(5)-((4-iodobenzyl)thiomethyl)-1H-imidazole, which behaved in vivo as the first improgan antagonist. The synthesis and pharmacological properties of this drug (named CC12) are described herein. In rats, CC12 (50-500 nmol, i.c.v.) produced dose-dependent inhibition of improgan (200-400 nmol) antinociception on the tail flick and hot plate tests. When given alone to rats, CC12 had no effects on nociceptive latencies, or on other observable behavioral or motor functions. Maximal inhibitory effects of CC12 (500 nmol) were fully surmounted with a large i.c.v. dose of improgan (800 nmol), demonstrating competitive antagonism. In mice, CC12 (200-400 nmol, i.c.v.) behaved as a partial agonist, producing incomplete improgan antagonism, but also limited antinociception when given alone. Radioligand binding, receptor autoradiography, and electrophysiology experiments showed that CC12's antagonist properties are not explained by activity at 25 sites relevant to analgesia, including known receptors for cannabinoids, opioids or histamine. The use of CC12 as an improgan antagonist will facilitate the characterization of improgan analgesia. Furthermore, because CC12 was also found presently to inhibit opioid and cannabinoid antinociception, it is suggested that this drug modifies a biochemical mechanism shared by several classes of analgesics. Elucidation of this mechanism will enhance understanding of the biochemistry of pain relief. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Thienorphine: Receptor binding and behavioral effects in rhesus monkeys	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							KAPPA-OPIOID RECEPTOR; DISCRIMINATIVE-STIMULUS; HEROIN-ADDICTS; CLINICAL-TRIAL; BUPRENORPHINE; MORPHINE; NALTREXONE; AGONIST; ANTAGONIST; WITHDRAWAL	Thienorphine is an oripavine with long-lasting antinociceptive effects in mice that are thought to be mediated by mu-opioid receptors. This study examined the receptor binding of thienorphine in cell membrane homogenates and its behavioral effects in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). Affinity and potency were determined using radioligand displacement and stimulation of guanosine 5'-O-( 3-[S-35] thio) triphosphate binding in C6 (mu, delta) and Chinese hamster ovary (kappa) cell membranes. Thienorphine displayed high affinity for kappa-, mu-, and delta-opioid receptors with K-i values of 0.14, 0.22, and 0.69 nM, respectively. Thienorphine partially stimulated kappa-opioid (75%) and mu-opioid (19%) receptors and not mu- opioid receptors. Thienorphine dose-dependently increased tail-withdrawal latency for 50 degrees C water and not 55 degrees C water with effects lasting for more than 7 days. The mu- opioid receptor antagonist nor-binaltorphimine (nor-BNI) (3.2 mg/kg) and a large dose (1.0 mg/ kg) of naltrexone prevented thienorphine-induced antinociception. Thienorphine enhanced the antinociceptive effects of morphine and U50,488 [trans-3, 4-dichloro-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-cyclohexyl]-benzeneacetamide] with 50 degrees C water; with 55 degrees C water, thienorphine enhanced the effects of morphine and attenuated the effects of U50,488. In other monkeys, thienorphine decreased responding in both components of a multiple schedule of food presentation and stimulus shock termination for up to 8 days; naltrexone and nor-BNI partially prevented these rate-decreasing effects. In morphine-treated monkeys discriminating naltrexone, thienorphine, and U50,488 neither substituted for nor modified the naltrexone discriminative stimulus. Thienorphine and U50,488 produced the same directly observable signs. These results show that thienorphine has long-lasting effects that seem to be mediated by low-efficacy agonism at kappa-opioid receptors, both in vitro and in vivo.

A variety of models have been applied to such data in several published articles; however to date, these models have not been validated with test-retest data. We recruited 11 healthy subjects and conducted two identical scans on each subject on the same day. We considered four different models (one-and two-tissue compartment kinetic models, likelihood estimation in graphical analysis (LEGA; a bias-free alternative to the graphical method), and basis pursuit) along with fast noniterative approximations to the kinetic models. We considered four different outcome measures (total volume of distribution (VT), binding potential with (BP) and without (BP1), free-fraction adjustment, and specific-to-nonspecific equilibrium partition coefficient (BP2)). To assess the performance of each model, we compared results using six different metrics ( percent difference (PD) and within-subject mean sum of squares for reproducibility, interclass coefficient for reliability, variance across subjects, identifiability based on bootstrap resampling of residuals for each method, and time stability analysis to determine minimal required scanning time). We considered analysis of both at the voxel level and at the region of interest (ROI) level and compared results from these two approaches to assess agreement. We determined that 100 mins of scanning time is adequate and that for ROI- level analysis, LEGA gives best results. Average PD is 5.51 for VT, 20.7 for BP, 17.2 for BP1, and 16.5 for BP2 across all regions. For voxel-level analysis we determined that the one-tissue compartment noniterative model is best.

The aim of this study was to determine the influence of late pregnancy in the uterus-relaxing effect of terbutaline in the rat in vitro. Rat uterine tissues from late pregnancy (days 15, 18, 20 and 22) were used. In vitro electrical field-stimulation (EFS) was used to evoke contractions. The radioligand-binding technique, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and radioimmunoassay technique were used to determine the beta-adrenergic receptor density and mRNA level and the plasma sex hormone level, respectively. The activated G-protein level of the P-adrenergic receptors was investigated by a radiolabelled GTP binding assay. EFS-induced contractions were inhibited by terbutaline. This effect decreased towards term with respect to both the EC50 and maximal inhibition values. A drop in plasma progesterone level was also detected. Binding studies revealed an increase in beta-adrenergic receptor number on the last day of pregnancy, which correlated with the change in receptor mRNA level. The G-protein-activating effect of terbutaline decreased continuously between days 15 and 20. Surprisingly, terbutaline decreased the G-protein activation to below the basal level on day 22. However, progesterone pretreatment set back the uterine action of terbutaline, increased the density of the beta(2)-adrenergic receptors and their mRNA level and increased the G-protein-activating property of terbutaline. These data provide evidence of a pregnancy-induced decrease in activated G-protein level after beta 2-agonist stimulation. The decrease in plasma progesterone level has a crucial role in this process. The effects Of beta(2)-adrenergic receptor agonists in tocolytic therapy may possibly be potentiated with progesterone.

In the present study, we show for the first time that the adenine receptor is expressed in membrane preparations of native tissues and cell lines in high density, including rat brain cortex, rat brain striatum, and the mouse neuroblastoma X rat glioma hybrid cell line NG108-15. Saturation analysis with [H-3] adenine at rat brain cortical membranes exhibited a single high-affinity binding site with a K-D value of 27.2 nM, and a binding capacity of 2.28 pmol/mg of protein. Kinetic studies revealed unusual binding kinetics of [H-3] adenine with rapid association and slow dissociation. A series of compounds were investigated in [H-3] adenine competition experiments at rat brain cortex. Only minor substitution of the adenine structure was tolerated, the most potent compounds of the present series being 2-fluoroadenine (K-i value of 620 nM), 8-thioadenine (K-i value of 2.77 muM), N-6-methyladenine (K-i value of 3.64 muM), and 7-methyladenine (K-i value of 4.13 muM), all of which were partial agonists (40-60% intrinsic activity). Adenine dose dependently inhibited forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase in membrane preparations of NG108-15 cells as well as in intact cells, showing that the receptor is functional in NG108-15 cells. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction experiments followed by sequencing indicate that the NG108-15 cells express the murine ortholog of the adenine receptor. Moreover, preliminary radioligand binding studies with [H-3] adenine at membranes of human astrocytoma 1321N1 cells suggest that a human ortholog of the rat adenine receptor exists.

All compounds showed high affinity for the DAT. The IC50 values ranged from 0.5 to 26 nM. With the exception of 3e and 3f, which have no substituent on the 2beta-(1,2-isoxazole) ring, all compounds were selective for the DAT relative to the 5-HTT and NET. No compound showed death when dosed at 100 mg/kg; however, most compounds did show signs typical of dopamine activity. The ED50 values for 2beta-(1,2-isoxazoles) that caused locomotor stimulation ranged from 0.2 to 12.8 mg/kg. Most compounds showed slower on-set and longer duration of action relative to cocaine. Surprisingly, 3beta-(4-methylphenyl)-2beta-[3-(4'-chlorophenyl)isoxazol-5-yl]tropane (3p) and 3beta-(4-methylphenyl)-2beta-[3-(4'-methylphenyl)isoxazol-5-yl]tropane (3r) did not produce significant increases in locomotor activity. In the cocaine discrimination test, all analogues showed full or at least 50% generalization with the exception of 3p, which did not show generalization. Importantly, both the locomotor activity and the cocaine discrimination ED50 values were correlated with the DAT binding but not 5-HTT and NET binding. This provides further support for the dopamine hypothesis of cocaine abuse. High DAT affinity and selectivity, increased locomotor activity with slow onset and long duration of action, and generalization to cocaine shown by the 3beta-(substituted phenyl)-2beta-(3-substituted isoxazol-5-yl)tropanes are properties thought necessary for a pharmacotherapy for treating cocaine abuse.

Following a convenient labelling protocol, the radiopeptide, [Tc-99m]Demobesin 1, formed in nearly quantitative yields and with high specific activities. Both unlabelled and labelled peptide demonstrated high-affinity binding in membrane preparations of the human androgen-independent prostate adenocarcinoma PC-3 cell line. The IC50 values determined for Demobesin 1 and [Tyro]BN were 0.70+/-0.08 nM and 1.5+/-0.20 nM, respectively, while the K-d defined for [Tc-99m/Tc-99g]Demobesin 1 was 0.67+/-0.10 nM. [Tc-99m]Demobesin 1 was rather stable in murine plasma, whereas it degraded rapidly in kidney and liver homogenates. After injection in healthy Swiss albino mice, [Tc-99m]Demobesin 1 accumulated very efficiently in the target organs (pancreas, intestinal tract) via a GRP-R-mediated process, as shown by in vivo receptor blocking experiments. An equally high and GRP-R-mediated uptake was exhibited by [Tc-99m]Demobesin 1 after injection in PC-3 tumour-bearing athymic mice. The initial high radioligand uptake of 16.2+/-3.1%ID/g in the PC-3 xenografts at 1 h p.i. remained at a similar level (15.61+/-1.19%ID/g) at 4 h p.i. Even after 24 h p.i., when the radioactivity had cleared from all other tissues, a value of 5.24+/-0.67%ID/g was still observed in the tumour. The high and prolonged localization of [Tc-99m]Demobesin 1 at the tumour site and its rapid background clearance are very promising qualities for GRP-R-targeted tumour imaging in man.

According to their molecular, biological, and pharmacological characteristics, they ore subdivided into alpha(1)-, alpha(2)- and beta(1)-, beta(2)-, beta(3)-, beta(4)-adrenoceptors. In cardiac disease, there is often a selective downregulation of beta(1)-adrenoceptors associated with a relative increase in beta(2)- and alpha(1)-adrenoceptors. Functional imaging techniques like single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) provide the unique capability for non-invasive assessment of cardiac adrenoceptors. Radioligands with high specific binding to cardiac alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors suitable for radiolabelling are required for clinical studies. The non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist [C-11]CGP-12177 was used to quantify beta-adrenoceptor density using PET in patients with heart disease. New non-selective ligands (e. g. [C-11]CGP-12388, [F-18]CGP-12388, [C-11]corozolol and [F-18]fluorocarazolol) are currently evaluated; PI-selective radioligands (e. g. [C-11]CGP-26505, [C-11]bisoprolol, [C-11]HX-CH 44) and beta(2)-Selective radioligands (e. g. [C-11]formoterol, [C-11]ICI-118551) were assessed in animals. None of them turned out as suitable for cardiac PET. Potential radioligands for imaging cardiac alpha(1)-adrenoceptors ore based on prozosin. Whereas [C-11]prozosin shows low specific binding to myocardium, its derivative [C-11]GB67 looks more promising. The putative alpha(2)-adrenoceptor radioligand [C-11]MK-912 shows high uptake in rodent myocardium but has not yet been evaluated in man. A number of radioligands were evaluated for assessing cardiac adrenoceptors using PET. New radioligands are needed to provide more insight into cardiac pathophysiology which may influence the therapeutic management of patients with cardiovascular disease.

[F-18]MPPF is a useful radioligand for quantitative imaging of 5-HT1A receptors in human subjects. Previous studies have shown that the binding of some radioligands is sensitive to changes in neurotransmitter concentration, whereas in other cases, binding is not affected. In the present study we investigated if [F-18]MPPF binding to the 5-HT1A receptor is sensitive to changes in 5-HT. Changes in 5-HT levels were achieved by influencing its synthesis through tryptophan depletion, including a tryptophan-free amino acid drink 4.5 h prior to the PET scan and tryptophan infusion (10 mg/ml, 50 mg/kg, 30 min, starting 60 min prior to the PET scan). Binding of [F-18]MPPF in the brain of six healthy, male volunteers was compared in these two conditions. Mean binding potentials in the medial temporal cortex, cortical regions, and raphe nucleus did not significantly differ between the two conditions. The results of the study show that, under the experimental conditions used, [F-18]MPPF binding was not affected. It is hypothesized that the increases in 5-HT levels needed to produce a measurable effect on [F-18]MPPF binding would be significantly greater than that possible with tryptophan manipulation. Therefore, in pathological conditions, where such large increases in 5-HT levels are not expected, [F-18]MPPF seems a useful ligand to measure 5-HT1A receptor distribution without the interference of endogenous 5-HT.

Methods: Whole-body scans were obtained up to 48 h after intravenous injection of 555 MBq Tc-99m-RP527 in each of 6 subjects. Blood samples were taken at various times up to 48 h after injection. Urine was collected up to 48 h after injection for calculation of renal clearance and whole-body clearance. Time-activity curves were generated for the thyroid, heart, breasts in women, testes in men, and liver by fitting the organ-specific geometric mean counts, obtained from regions of interest, on the respective images as a function of the time after injection. The MIRD formulation was applied to calculate the absorbed radiation dose for various organs. Results: The serial whole-body images showed rapid hepatobiliary excretion, resulting in low background and potentially high-contrast imaging of the thoracic region. Imaging of abdominal tumors may prove problematic, however, because of the extensive bowel activity. Tc-99m-RP527 was predominantly cleared by the kidneys and to a lesser extent by the gastrointestinal tract. The mean excretion in the urine (+/- SD) at 48 h after injection was 58.3 +/- 5.4 percentage of the injected activity corrected for decay to the time of injection. The highest absorbed doses were received by the excretory organs (i.e., the urinary bladder and gallbladder wall). The average effective dose of Tc-99m-RP527 was estimated to be 0.0095 mSv/MBq. Conclusion: The biodistribution of Tc-99m-RP527 revealed low lung, myocardial, and liver uptake, which allowed early imaging of the supradiaphragmatic region with a favorable dosimetry (including effective dose) for administered activities required for SPECT imaging.

Though generally safe, side effects frequently occur that cause patient discomfort and sometimes lead to premature termination of the study or require aminophylline administration. Recently, a new class of A(2A) Ado receptor agonists was synthesized. ATL193 and ATL146e are 2-propynylcyclohexyl-5'-N-ethylcarboxamido derivatives of Ado. The study goals were to evaluate the potency and selectivity of these new compounds on-recombinant canine Ado receptors and to evaluate their hemodynamic properties in dogs to assess their usefulness as vasodilators for myocardial perfusion imaging. Methods and Results-In assays of recombinant canine Ado receptors, ATL-193 and ATL-146e were highly selective for the A(2A) over the A(1) and A(3) receptors and were more potent than MRE-0470 and CGS-21680. In 16 anesthetized dogs, the agonists were administered by infusion (ATL-193; n=7 normal) or bolus injection (ATL-146e; n=9 critical left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis), and hemodynamic responses were compared with those of Ado. Both agonists produced dose-dependent coronary flow (CF) elevation without provoking the hypotension observed with Ado. After an ATL-146e bolus, the CF increase was sustained for several minutes, providing ample time for injection and myocardial uptake of Tc-99m-sestamibi, and CF returned to baseline within 20 minutes. The CF increase was completely blocked by the selective A(2A) antagonist ZM241385 (3 mug . kg(-1) . min(-1)). Conclusions-ATL-193 and ATL-146e are highly potent and selective Ado A(2A) receptor agonists with excellent potential for use as vasodilators for myocardial perfusion imaging. An important advantage of ATL-146e is the ability to administer it by bolus injection.

Previous analyses of bolus injection [F-18]altanserin data provided 5-HT2A specific binding measures that were highly correlated with the in vitro distribution of 5-HT2A receptors and reflected decreased binding after ketanserin (5-HT2A antagonist) administration. These observations were made in the presence of a nonspecific tissue component that was consistent with blood-brain barrier (BBB) passage of radiolabeled metabolites (radiometabolites). In this work, we evaluated the in vivo kinetics of [18F]altanserin and two major radiometabolites of [F-18]altanserin, focusing on the kinetics of free and nonspecifically-bound radioactivity. PET studies were performed in baboons after the bolus injection of [F-18]altanserin or one of its major radiometabolites, either [F-18]altanserinol or [F-18]4-(4-fluorobenzoyl)piperidine, at baseline and after pharmacologic receptor blockade (blocking data). The cerebellar and blocking data were analyzed using either single (parent radiotracer) or dual (parent radiotracer and radiometabolites) input function methods. After bolus injection of either [F-18]altanserin metabolite, radioactivity crossed the BBB and localized nonspecifically. The radiometabolites were found to contribute to nonspecific "background" radioactivity that was similar in receptor-poor and receptor-rich regions. After bolus injection in baboons, two of the major radiometabolites of [F-18]altanserin crossed the BBB and contributed to a fairly uniform background of nonspecific radioactivity. This uniformity suggests that conventional analyses are appropriate for human bolus injection [F-18]altanserin PET data, although these methods may overestimate [F-18]altanserin nonspecific binding.

The functional effects of brucine were examined on the M-1 muscarinic receptors in the rabbit isolated vas deferens preparation. Brucine (10-100 muM) enhanced the effects of the muscarinic agonist McN-A-343 at presynaptic M-1 muscarinic receptors in the rabbit isolated vas deferens preparation, but only when brucine was added prior to McN-A-343. This effect is indicative of a positive allosteric action. It was poorly reversed on washing. Brucine did not affect the responses to the mamba venom muscarinic toxins MT2 and MT4, which are also allosteric activators in this preparation. Brucine (10-100 muM) caused a significant decrease in the twitch response to electrical stimulation in the rabbit vas deferens preparation, which was not antagonised by 100 nM pirenzepine (an M-1 muscarinic antagonist). Brucine and MT4, but not MT2, caused significant decreases (p < 0.05) in the responses to noradrenaline in the rabbit vas deferens preparation. Responses to ATP and KCl were not affected. In radioligand binding assays, brucine displaced the <alpha>(1)-adrenoceptor ligand prazosin from its specific binding sites in membranes made from rat cerebral cortex and rat vas deferens. The apparent K-i values were 150 and 3.4 muM in the cortical and vas deferens membranes, respectively. The positive allosterism found with brucine at cloned M-1 receptors seems to be mirrored at native M-1 receptors. However, the unexpected blocking effects at alpha (1)-adrenoceptors indicates that more selective ligands than brucine are required as starting points for the design of specific enhancers of the activity of M-1 receptors with therapeutic potential.

Using a restraint stress paradigm, bath normotensive Wistar. Kyoto (WKY) and Spontaneously Hypertensive mts (SHR) underwent acute (1 h restraint in a perspex tube), chronic (1 h restraint for ten consecutive days) or no restraint (control) stress. Following cessation of restraint, rats were processed by incubating sections of brain stem and kidney with [I-125]-HO-LVA (0.03 nM) or [I-125]Sar(1)Ile(8)-AngiorensinII (0.5 nhl), in the presence of PD123319 (10 muM) or losartan (10 muM), to determine the distribution and density of vasopressin V-1A, angiotensin AT(1) and AT(2) receptors, respectively, Analysis of autoradiograms indicated changes in the density of radioligand binding in acutely and chronically-stressed rats, as compared to controls. For example, V-1A binding in the medial nucleus tractus solitarius (SolM) decreased in the WKY but increased in the SHR. AT(1) binding in SolM did not significantly change in the WKY but decreased in the SHR with repeated restraint. In kidney slices, AT(1) binding decreased with stress in the WKY (-17%) but increased in SHR (+10-15%). AT(2) binding in the kidney showed a pattern similar to that of AT(1) binding in SHR, but not WKY. Graded increases in V-1A binding were measured in kidney medulla and cortex of both strains (+50-60% with chronic restraint). These results suggest that physiological adaptation to restraint is associated with specific changes in V-1A, AT(1) and AT(2) receptor density within brain nuclei and kidney.

Neurokinin (NK)A is the endogenous ligand for the tachykinin NK2 receptor. In the present study, tachykinins and selective receptor agonists were tested as contractile agonists in human colon circular muscle and [I-125]-NKA was used to localize binding sites in human colon. 2. In strips of circular muscle, removal of mucosa and submucosa significantly (P < 0.05) increased the potency and the maximum response achieved by NKA. 3. The rank order of potency of tachykinin and selective receptor agonists in contracting circular muscle strips was NKA greater than or equal to [Lys(5),MeLeu(9),Nle(10)]NKA(4-10) greater than or equal to neuropeptide (NP)gamma greater than or equal to [beta Ala(8)]NKA(4-10) >> NKB > substance P (SP) >> senktide approximate to [Pro(9)]SP. 4. Specific binding sites for [I-125]-NKA were densely localized over circular muscle and muscularis mucosae. Weak specific binding was seen on longitudinal muscle and taenia coli, whereas no binding sites were seen on mucosa, ganglia or blood vessels. 5. In circular muscle, the selective NK2 receptor agonist [Lys(5),MeLeu(9),Nle(10)]NKA(4-10) produced weak increases (maximum 37%) in inositol monophosphate formation with a pD(2) of 6.8 +/- 0.51 (n = 3). Carbachol (100 mu mol/L) was also a weak stimulant (maximum 45%). These agonists were over 10-fold more efficacious in stimulation of inositol monophosphate in rat urinary bladder. 6. In conclusion, [I-125]-NKA binding sites localized on human colon circular muscle were characterized as NK2 receptors. Functionally, the tachykinin NK2 receptor is mediating circular smooth muscle contraction. Although the human NK2 receptor is coupled to the phosphatidylinositol pathway, other second messenger mechanisms may also operate in this tissue.

However, the interaction between the two cardioprotective adenosine receptors and the question of which receptor is the more important anti-ischemic receptor remain largely unexplored. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that activation of both receptors exerted a cardioprotective effect that was significantly greater than activation of either receptor individually. This was accomplished by using a novel design in which new binary conjugates of adenosine A(1) and A(3) receptor agonists were synthesized and tested in a novel cardiac myocyte model of adenosine-elicited cardioprotection. Binary drugs having mixed selectivity for both A(1) and A(3) receptors were created through the covalent linking of functionalized congeners of adenosine agonists, each being selective for either the A(1) or A(3) receptor subtype. MRS 1740 and MRS 1741, thiourea-linked, regioisomers of a binary conjugate, were highly potent and selective in radioligand binding assays for A(1) and A(3) receptors (K-i values of 0.7-3.5 nM) versus A(2A) receptors. The myocyte models utilized cultured chick embryo cells, either ventricular cells expressing native adenosine A(1) and A(3) receptors, or engineered atrial cells, in which either human A(3) receptors alone or both human A(1) and A(3) receptors were expressed. The binary agonist MRS 1741 coactivated A(1) and A(3) receptors simultaneously, with full cardioprotection (EC50 similar to 0.1 nM) dependent on expression of both receptors, Thus, co-activation of both adenosine A(1) and A(3) receptors by the binary A(1)/A(3) agonists represents a novel general cardioprotective approach for the treatment of myocardial ischemia.

We aimed to evaluate the association between serum NfL (sNfL) and TSPO-PET-measurable microglial activation in the brain of patients with MS. MethodsMicroglial activation was detected using PET and the TSPO-binding radioligand [C-11]PK11195. Distribution volume ratio (DVR) was used to evaluate specific [C-11]PK11195-binding. sNfL levels were measured using single molecule array (Simoa). The associations between [C-11]PK11195 DVR and sNfL were evaluated using correlation analyses and false discovery rate (FDR) corrected linear regression modelling. Results44 patients with MS (40 relapsing-remitting and 4 secondary progressive) and 24 age-matched and sex-matched healthy controls were included. In the patient group with elevated brain [C-11]PK11195 DVR (n=19), increased sNfL associated with higher DVR in the lesion rim (estimate (95% CI) 0.49 (0.15 to 0.83), p(FDR)=0.04) and perilesional normal appearing white matter (0.48 (0.14 to 0.83), p(FDR)=0.04), and with a higher number and larger volume of TSPO-PET-detectable rim-active lesions defined by microglial activation at the plaque edge (0.46 (0.10 to 0.81), p(FDR)=0.04 and 0.50 (0.17 to 0.84), p(FDR)=0.04, respectively). Based on the multivariate stepwise linear regression model, the volume of rim-active lesions was the most relevant factor affecting sNfL. ConclusionsOur demonstration of an association between microglial activation as measured by increased TSPO-PET signal, and elevated sNfL emphasises the significance of smouldering inflammation for progression-promoting pathology in MS and highlights the role of rim-active lesions in promoting neuroaxonal damage.

We aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of this treatment in real-world practice. Methods We included Japanese men treated with Ra-223 for bone-metastatic CRPC from 10 institutions, retrospectively. Primary endpoint was OS. Secondary endpoint was maximum decline of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase, and prostate-specific antigen values, the rate of adverse events, and time to pathological fracture after Ra-223 treatment. Exploratory endpoint was the associations between clinical parameters and OS. Results In total, 73 men with bone metastatic CRPC treated with Ra-223 were enrolled. The median OS was 20.9 months. ALP levels decreased significantly from pre-treatment (p = 0.03). Anemia occurred in three (4.1%) patients. Grade >= 3 non-pathological fractures occurred in four (5.5%) men. Nine (12.3%) patients presented pathological fracture; 7/30 (23.3%) were in men without concomitant use of a bone-modifying agent (BMA) while 2/43 (4.7%) were in patients with concomitant BMA (p = 0.03). The median OS in patients with >= 3 cycles treatment (27.2 months, p < 0.001) or hemoglobin >= 12 g/dl (27.2 months, p = 0.001) or absence of bone pain (36.3 months, p = 0.004) was significantly longer compared to those who with <= 2 cycles or hemoglobin<12 g/dl or presence of bone paint, respectively. Conclusions This study has shown the outcomes of Ra-223 treatment in real-world practice, where the number of treatment cycles, baseline anemia and bone pain may be useful to predict OS in Ra-223 treatment.

Temporal and spatial changes in synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) under kainic acid induced epileptogenesis: An autoradiographic study	EPILEPSY RESEARCH			English	Article						[H-3]UCB-J; SV2A; Epileptogenesis	LOBE EPILEPSY; BINDING-SITE; PROTEIN 2A; MODEL; SEIZURE; MECHANISMS; EXPRESSION; NEURONS; PATTERN; BRAIN	Synaptic Vesicle Glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) has been proposed as a presynaptic marker in several neurological disorders. Not only is SV2A the target for the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam, but also considered a marker of mature pre-synapses. In this study, we aimed to assess the binding of [H-3]UCB-J as a selective radioligand for SV2A to visualize and determine changes during different stages of epileptogenesis by in-vitro autoradiography in rat models of temporal lobe epilepsy. Two different kainic acid (KA) injection routes were used to model temporal lobe epilepsy in the rat; a systemic (10 mg/kg KA injected intraperitoneally) and a local model (1.875 mM KA injected intrahippocampally). Brain tissue was sampled at different time points after the initial status epilepticus and semi-quantitative [H-3]UCB-J autoradiography was performed to determine temporal and spatial changes under the progression of epileptogenesis. A decrease in [H-3]UCB-J binding was observed in many brain areas in the acute phases after both types of kainic acid administration. Peak reductions occurred slightly before in systemic-treated animals (within 3-10 days) than after local-treated animals (within 5-15 days). Interestingly in the systemic model, we observed a full restoration in the binding level 30 days after the treatment in most areas probably reflecting neuronal reorganization. However, after the local injection in the hippocampus, the binding in the hippocampus, and in temporal and piriform cortices did not return to basal levels. The time-course profile displayed lateralization in the local model. These results demonstrate changes in the amount of a pre synaptic SV2A binding site after seizures and suggest that SV2A may have importance in eliciting spontaneous seizures and/or be a biomarker for epileptogenesis. The present study shows that SV2A is a biomarker of acute phase epileptogenesis in specific brain regions.

Synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 A (SV2A) is a potential marker reported to be localized in the endocrine pancreas. [C-11]UCB-J is a novel positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer that binds to SV2A and was previously evaluated as a synaptic marker in the central nervous system. Here, we evaluated whether [C-11]UCB-J could be utilized as a PET tracer for the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas by targeting SV2A. The mRNA transcription of SV2A was evaluated in human isolated islets of Langerhans and exocrine tissue. In vitro autoradiography was performed on pancreas and brain sections from rats and pigs, and consecutive sections were immunostained for insulin. Sprague-Dawley rats were examined with PET-MRI and ex vivo autoradiography at baseline and with administration of levetiracetam (LEV). Similarly, pigs were examined with dynamic PET-CT over the pancreas and brain after administration of [C-11]UCB-J at baseline and after pretreatment with LEV. In vivo radioligand binding was assessed using a one-compartment tissue model. The mRNA expression of SV2A was nearly 7 times higher in endocrine tissue than in exocrine tissue (p < 0.01). In vitro autoradiography displayed focal binding of [C-11]UCB-J in the pancreas of rats and pigs, but the binding pattern did not overlap with the insulin-positive areas or with ex vivo autoradiography. In rats, pancreas binding was higher than that in negative control tissues but could not be blocked by LEV. In pigs, the pancreas and brain exhibited accumulation of [C-11]UCB-J above the negative control tissue spleen. While brain binding could be blocked by pretreatment with LEV, a similar effect was not observed in the pancreas. Transcription data indicate SV2A to be a valid target for imaging islets of Langerhans, but [C-11]UCB-J does not appear to have sufficient sensitivity for this application.

[C-11]OMDV has a high binding affinity for VAChT both in vitro and in vivo. Racemic OMDV ando-trimethylstannyl-trans-decalinvesamicol (OTDV), which are precursors for synthesis of [C-11]OMDV, were separated into (-)-optical isomers ((-)-OMDV and (-)-OTDV) and (+)-optical isomers ((+)-OMDV and (+)-OTDV) by HPLC. In the in vitro binding assay, (-)-OMDV(7.2 nM) showed eight times higher binding affinity (Ki) to VAChT than that of (+)-OMDV(57.5 nM). In the biodistribution study, the blood-brain barrier permeability of both enantiomers ((-)-[C-11]OMDV and (+)-[C-11]OMDV) was similarly high (about 1.0%ID/g) at 2 min post-injection. However, (+)-[C-11]OMDV clearance from the brain was faster than (-)-[C-11]OMDV. In the in vivo blocking study, accumulation of (-)-[C-11]OMDV in the cortex was markedly decreased (approximately 30% of control) by coadministration of vesamicol, and brain uptake of (-)-[C-11]OMDV was not significantly altered by coadministration of (+)-pentazocine or (+)-3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-propylpiperidine ((+)-3-PPP). PET-CT imaging revealed inhibition of the rat brain uptake of (-)-[C-11]OMDV by coadministration of vesamicol. In conclusion, (-)-[C-11]OMDV, which is an enantiomer of OMDV, selectively binds to VAChT with high affinity in the rat brain in vivo. (-)-[C-11]OMDV may be utilized as a potential PET ligand for studying presynaptic cholinergic neurons in the brain.

These receptors have been shown to be involved in brain diseases, for example, Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy. To understand the functional role of AMPA receptors at the molecular level and their potential as targets for drugs, development of tool compounds is essential. We have previously reported the synthesis of six bicyclic pyrimidinedione-based analogues of willardiine with differences limited to the pyrimidinedione-fused five-membered rings. Despite minor molecular differences, we observed >500-fold difference in binding affinity of the compounds at full-length GluA2. Here, we report binding affinities and the binding mode of these compounds at the ligand-binding domain of GluA2 using X-ray crystallography. The structures revealed similar binding modes, with distinct differences in the interaction between GluA2 and the compounds. The methylene (2) and sulfur (3) containing compounds showed the greatest binding affinities. Changing the dihydrothiophene (3) into pyrrolidine (4), N-methyl pyrrolidine (5), or dihydrofuran (6) induced flexibility in the position of a binding-site water molecule and changes in the hydrogen-bonding network between compound, water, and GluA2. This might be essential for explaining the reduced binding affinity of these compounds. The weakest binding affinity was observed when the aliphatic oxygen containing dihydrofuran (6) was changed into an aromatic furan system (7). Molecular docking studies revealed two possible orientations of 7, whereas only one binding mode was observed for the other analogues. This could likely contribute to the weakest binding affinity of 7 at GluA2.

We also evaluated the relation between tracer uptake, clinical symptoms and peripheral immunological markers. Method: Second-generation radioligand [F-18]-PBR111 TSPO PET-CT was used for longitudinal dynamic imaging in 14 male psychosis patients and 17 male age-matched healthy control subjects. Patients were first scanned during an acute psychotic episode followed by a second scan after treatment. Prior genotyping of subjects for the rs6917 polymorphism distinguished high- and mixed-affinity binders. The main outcome was regional volume of distribution (V-T), representing TSPO binding. Plasma concentrations of CRP, cytokines and kynurenines were measured at each timepoint. Results: We found a significant three-way interaction between time of scan, age and cohort (cortical grey matter F6.50, p.020). Age-dependent differences in V-T existed between cohorts during the psychotic state, but not at follow-up. Patients' relative change in V-T over time correlated with age (cortical grey matter Pearson's r.574). PANSS positive subscale scores correlated with regional V-T during psychosis (cortical grey matter r.767). Plasma CRP and quinolinic acid were independently associated with lower V-T. Conclusions: We identified a differential age-dependent pattern of TSPO binding from psychosis to follow-up in our cohort of male psychosis patients. We recommend future TSPO PET studies in psychosis patients to differentiate between clinical states and consider potential age-related effects.

Herein we report on the pharmacological properties (potency, affinity and efficacy) of the new compound, 14-O-methylmorphine (14-OMeM) in in vitro. Additionally, we also investigated the antinociceptive effect of the novel compound, as well as its inhibitory action on gastrointestinal transit in in vivo. The potency and efficacy of test compound were measured by [35S] GTP.S binding, isolated mouse vas deferens (MVD) and rat vas deferens (RVD) assays. The affinity of 14-O-MeM for opioid receptors was assessed by radioligand binding and MVD assays. The antinociceptive and gastrointestinal effects of the novel compound were evaluated in the rat tail-flick test and charcoal meal test, respectively. Morphine, DAMGO, Ile(5,6) deltorphin II, deltorphin II and U-69593 were used as reference compounds. 14-O-MeM showed higher efficacy (Emax) and potency (EC50) than morphine in MVD, RVD or [ 35S] GTP.S binding. In addition, 14-O-MeM compared to morphine showed higher affinity for ae-opioid receptor (MOR). In vivo, in rat tail-flick test 14-O-MeM proved to be stronger antinociceptive agent than morphine after peripheral or central administration. Additionally, both compounds inhibited the gastrointestinal peristalsis. However, when the antinociceptive and antitransit doses for each test compound are compared, 14-O-MeM proved to have slightly more favorable pharmacological profile. Our results affirm that 14-O-MeM, an opioid of high efficacy and affinity for MOR can be considered as a novel analgesic agent of potential clinical value.

Antidepressant-like properties were investigated in the forced swim test (FST) in mice and rats. Anxiolytic-like activity was evaluated in the four-plate test in mice and elevated plus maze test (EPM) in rats. Imipramine and escitalopram were used as reference drugs in the FST, and diazepam was used as a standard anxiolytic drug in animal models of anxiety. Our results indicate that HBK-14 and HBK-15 possess high or moderate affinity for serotonergic 5-HT2, adrenergic alpha(1), and dopaminergic D-2 receptors as well as being full 5-HT1A and 5-HT7 receptor antagonists. We also present their potent antidepressant-like activity (HBK-14-FST mice: 2.5 and 5 mg/kg; FST rats: 5 mg/kg) and (HBK-15-FST mice: 1.25, 2.5 and 5 mg/kg; FST rats: 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg). We show that HBK-14 (four-plate test: 2.5 and 5 mg/kg; EPM: 2.5 mg/kg) and HBK-15 (four-plate test: 2.5 and 5 mg/kg; EPM: 5 mg/kg) possess anxiolytic-like properties. Among the two, HBK-15 has stronger antidepressant-like properties, and HBK-14 displays greater anxiolytic-like activity. Lastly, we demonstrate the involvement of serotonergic system, particularly 5-HT1A receptor, in the antidepressant-and anxiolytic-like actions of investigated compounds.

Moreover, the present study attempted to assess some of the mechanisms involved in the pharmacological activity of these compounds. In the previous studies it was shown that these compounds were highly active in the phenylbenzoquinone-induced 'writhing syndrome' test and had much lower activity in the hot plate, which indicates that mainly peripheral mechanisms of analgesia are involved in their effects. In these extended studies the analgesic activity of two tested compounds (4c, 4f) was confirmed in some animal models of pain. The studied compounds showed a significant and dose-related antinociceptive effect in the models of pain induced by formalin, capsaicin and glutamic acid. Both compounds decreased the edema formation and one of them (4c) attenuated mechanical hyperalgesia in carrageenan-induced paw inflammation in rats. Furthermore, both compounds inhibited cell migration, plasma exudation and nociceptive reaction in zymosan A-induced mouse peritonitis. In the subsequent studies, including experiments on isolated organs (ileum, trachea, aorta), radioligand assays and biochemical tests, it was demonstrated that analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of the investigated structures are largely due to their competitive antagonism for histamine H-1 receptor. The influence on the level of cAMP in inflammatory cells (shown in RAW 264.7 macrophages) and subsequent inhibition of cytokine (TNF alpha, IL-1 beta) release can also be one of the important mechanisms of their action. Moreover some additional mechanisms may also be involved in the eventual analgesic effect of tested pyrrolo[3,4-d]pyridazinone derivatives. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

GSK588045 is a novel compound with antagonist activity at 5-HT1A/1B/1D receptors and nanomolar affinity for the serotonin transporter, which was in development for the treatment of depression and anxiety. Here we present the results of an in vivo assessment of the relationship between plasma exposure and 5-HT1A receptor occupancy. Six Cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were scanned using the PET ligand [C-11]WAY100635 before and after dosing with GSK588045 (0.03, 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg 60 min i.v. infusion). Data was quantified using a simplified reference tissue model, with the cerebellar time-activity curve used as an input function. Plasma levels of GSK588045 were measured, and the EC50 of GSK588045 for 5-HT1A receptor occupancy was estimated. An E-max model described the relationship between the GSK588045 plasma concentration and 5-HT1A receptor occupancy data well. EC50 estimates (and 95% confidence intervals) for raphe nuclei and the frontal cortex were 6.99 (2.48 to 11.49) and 7.80 (2.84 to 12.76) ng/ml respectively. GSK588045 dose dependently blocked the signal of the PET ligand [C-11]WAY100635, confirming its brain entry and occupancy of 5-HT1A receptors in the primate brain. The estimated EC50 at the post-synaptic heteroreceptors and somatodendritic autoreceptors is similar. 5-HT1 receptor blockade by compounds such as GSK588045 may provide a faster alternate mechanism of antidepressant and anxiolytic action than standard SSRI treatment.

In this work we aimed to determine whether, as other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), H(3)Rs desensitize in response to agonist exposure. By using CHO-K1 cells stably transfected with the human H3R (hH(3)R) we show that functional responses (inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation in intact cells and stimulation of [S-35]-GTP gamma S binding to cell membranes) were markedly reduced after agonist exposure. For cAMP accumulation assays the effect was significant at 60 min with a maximum at 90 min. Agonist exposure resulted in decreased binding sites for the radioligand [H-3]-N-methyl-histamine ([H-3]-NMHA) to intact cells and modified the sub-cellular distribution of H(3)Rs, as detected by sucrose density gradients and [H-3]-NMHA binding to cell membranes, suggesting receptor internalization. The reduction in the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP formation observed after agonist pre-incubation was prevented by incubation in hypertonic medium or in ice-cold medium. Agonist-induced loss in binding sites was also prevented by hypertonic medium or incubation at 4 degrees C, but not by filipin III, indicating clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Immunodetection showed that CHO-K1 cells express GPCR kinases (GRKs) 2/3, and both the GRK general inhibitor ZnCl2 and a small interfering RNA against GRK-2 reduced receptor desensitization. Taken together these results indicate that hH(3)Rs experience homologous desensitization upon prolonged exposure to agonists, and that this process involves the action of GRK-2 and internalization via clathrin-coated vesicles.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate novel I-123-labeled pyridyl benzofuran derivatives as SPECT probes for A beta imaging. The formation of a pyridyl benzofuran backbone was accomplished by Suzuki coupling. [I-123/I-125]-labeled pyridyl benzofuran derivatives were readily prepared by an iododestannylation reaction. In vitro A beta binding assays were carried out using A beta(1-42) aggregates and postmortem human brain sections. Biodistribution experiments were conducted in normal mice at 2, 10, 30, and 60 min postinjection. A beta labeling in vivo was evaluated by small-animal SPECT/CT in Tg2576 transgenic mice injected with [I-123]8. Ex vivo autoradiography of the brain sections was performed after SPECT/CT. Iodinated pyridyl benzofuran derivatives showed excellent affinity for A beta(1-42) aggregates (2.4 to 10.3 nM) and intensely labeled A beta plaques in autoradiographs of postmortem AD brain sections. In biodistribution experiments using normal mice, all these derivatives displayed high initial uptake (4.03-5.49% ID/g at 10 min). [I-125]8 displayed the quickest clearance from the brain (1.30% ID/g at 60 min). SPECT/CT with [I-123]8 revealed higher uptake of radioactivity in the Tg2576 mouse brain than the wild-type mouse brain. Ex vivo autoradiography showed in vivo binding of [I-123]8 to Ab plaques in the Tg2576 mouse brain. These combined results warrant further investigation of [I-123]8 as a SPECT imaging agent for visualizing A beta plaques in the AD brain.

Species-specific vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) expression in mammalian pancreatic beta cells: implications for optimising radioligand-based human beta cell mass (BCM) imaging in animal models	DIABETOLOGIA			English	Article						Beta cell mass; Imaging; Pancreas; Tetrabenazine; Vesicular monoamine transporter	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; ENDOCRINE PANCREAS; GENE-EXPRESSION; RAT PANCREAS; 2 ISOFORMS; DISEASE; BINDING; PET; DIHYDROTETRABENAZINE; TETRABENAZINE	Aims/hypothesis Imaging of beta cell mass (BCM) is a major challenge in diabetes research. The vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) is abundantly expressed in human beta cells. Radiolabelled analogues of tetrabenazine (TBZ; a low-molecular-weight, cell-permeant VMAT2-selective ligand) have been employed for pancreatic islet imaging in humans. Since reports on TBZ-based VMAT2 imaging in rodent pancreas have been fraught with confusion, we compared VMAT2 gene expression patterns in the mouse, rat, pig and human pancreas, to identify appropriate animal models with which to further validate and optimise TBZ imaging in humans. Methods We used a panel of highly sensitive VMAT2 antibodies developed against equivalently antigenic regions of the transporter from each species in combination with immunostaining for insulin and species-specific in situ hybridisation probes. Individual pancreatic islets were obtained by laser-capture microdissection and subjected to analysis of mRNA expression of VMAT2. Results The VMAT2 protein was not expressed in beta cells in the adult pancreas of common mouse or rat laboratory strains, in contrast to its expression in beta cells (but not other pancreatic endocrine cell types) in the pancreas of pigs and humans. VMAT2- and tyrosine hydroxylase co-positive (catecholaminergic) innervation was less abundant in humans than in rodents. VMAT2-positive mast cells were identified in the pancreas of all species. Conclusions/interpretation Primates and pigs are suitable models for TBZ imaging of beta cells. Rodents, because of a complete lack of VMAT2 expression in the endocrine pancreas, are a 'null' model for assessing interference with BCM measurements by VMAT2-positive mast cells and sympathetic innervation in the pancreas.

Global decrease of serotonin-1A receptor binding after electroconvulsive therapy in major depression measured by PET	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						antidepressant; [carbonyl-C-11]WAY100635; electroconvulsive therapy; major depression; positron emission tomography; serotonin-1A receptor	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; BRAIN GLUCOSE-METABOLISM; 5-HT2 RECEPTORS; RESISTANT DEPRESSION; SHOCK; TRANSPORTER; DISORDERS; AMYGDALA; AUTORECEPTORS; TRYPTOPHAN	Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a potent therapy in severe treatment-refractory depression. Although commonly applied in psychiatric clinical routine since decades, the exact neurobiological mechanism regarding its efficacy remains unclear. Results from preclinical and clinical studies emphasize a crucial involvement of the serotonin-1A receptor (5-HT1A) in the mode of action of antidepressant treatment. This includes associations between treatment response and changes in 5-HT1A function and density by antidepressants. Further, alterations of the 5-HT1A receptor are consistently reported in depression. To elucidate the effect of ECT on 5-HT1A receptor binding, 12 subjects with severe treatment-resistant major depression underwent three positron emission tomography (PET) measurements using the highly selective radioligand [carbonyl-C-11]WAY100635, twice before (test-retest variability) and once after 10.08+/-2.35 ECT sessions. Ten patients (similar to 83%) were responders to ECT. The voxel-wise comparison of the 5-HT1A receptor binding (BPND) before and after ECT revealed a widespread reduction in cortical and subcortical regions (P<0.05 corrected), except for the occipital cortex and the cerebellum. Strongest reductions were found in regions consistently reported to be altered in major depression and involved in emotion regulation, such as the subgenual part of the anterior cingulate cortex (-27.5%), the orbitofrontal cortex (-30.1%), the amygdala (-31.8%), the hippocampus (-30.6%) and the insula (-28.9%). No significant change was found in the raphe nuclei. There was no significant difference in receptor binding in any region comparing the first two PET scans conducted before ECT. This PET study proposes a global involvement of the postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptor binding in the effect of ECT.

High-resolution metabolic profiling towards G protein-coupled receptors: Rapid and comprehensive screening of histamine H<sub>4</sub> receptor ligands	JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A			English	Article						Accurate-mass; MS/MS; Selectivity; Comprehensive metabolic profiling; High-resolution fractionation; G protein-coupled receptor	ACETYLCHOLINE BINDING-PROTEIN; NATURAL-PRODUCTS; DRUG DISCOVERY; ONLINE; IDENTIFICATION; TECHNOLOGY; TARGET; POTENT; ASSAY	In the past years we developed high-resolution screening platforms involving separation of bioactive mixtures and on-line or at-line bioassays for a wide variety of biological targets with parallel mass spectrometric detection and identification. In the current research, we make a major step forward in the development of at-line bioassays by implementation of radioligand receptor binding and functional cellular assays to evaluate bioactvity and selectivity. We demonstrate a new platform for high-resolution metabolic profiling of lead compounds for functional activity and selectivity toward the human histamine H-4 receptor (hH(4)R), a member of the large family of membrane-bound G protein-coupled receptors. In this platform analytical chemistry, cell biology and pharmacology are merged. The methodology is based on chromatographic separation of metabolic mixtures by HPLC coupled to high-resolution fractionation onto (multiple) microtiter well plates for complementary assaying. The methodology was used for efficient and rapid metabolic profiling of the drug clozapine and three selective hH(4)R lead compounds. With this new platform metabolites with undesired alterations in target selectivity profiles can be readily identified. Moreover, the parallel identification of metabolite structures. with accurate-mass measurements and MS/MS, allowed identification of liable metabolic 'hotspots' for further lead optimization and plays a central role in the workflow and in this study. The methodology can be easily adapted for use with other receptor screening formats. The efficient combination of pharmacological assays with analytical techniques by leveraging high-resolution at-line fractionation as a linking technology will allow implementation of comprehensive metabolic profiling in an early phase of the drug discovery process.

[C-11](R)-2-CH3O-N-n-propylnorapomorphine ([C-11]MNPA), which has an agonistic property to dopamine D-2 receptors (D(2)Rs), is expected to bind preferentially to D-2,D-high. The occupancy of dopamine D(2)Rs by antagonists to receptors has not been investigated using [C-11]MNPA. We compared dopamine D2R occupancies by risperidone, an antagonist to receptors, between [C-11]MNPA and [C-11]raclopride to confirm whether risperidone occupies D-2,D-high and D-2,D-low at almost identical proportions. PET studies were performed on 11 healthy men under resting condition and following oral administration of a single dose of risperidone (0.5-2.0 mg). Striatal receptor occupancy for each radioligand was calculated. The relationship between dose or plasma concentration of risperidone and dopamine D2R occupancy was calculated. Striatal dopamine D2R occupancies measured with [C-11]MNPA and [C-11]raclopride were 22-65% and 24-69%, respectively. In the striatum, ED50 values measured with [C-11]MNPA and [C-11]raclopride were 0.98 and 1.03 mg, respectively. The striatal ED50 values as calculated from plasma concentration were 9.15 ng/ml and 8.01 ng/ml, respectively. Almost identical occupancies and ED50 values were observed between the two radioligands, indicating that risperidone bound to D-2,D-high and D-2,D-low at almost identical proportions in a dose-dependent manner.

Influence of fluorophore and linker composition on the pharmacology of fluorescent adenosine A<sub>1</sub> receptor ligands	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						GPCRs; fluorescent ligands; molecular pharmacology; reporter genes; ligand binding; adenosine	SINGLE LIVING CELLS; MEMBRANE MICRODOMAINS; AGONIST; ANTAGONIST; COMPLEXES; PROTEINS	Background and purpose: The introduction of fluorescence-based techniques, and in particular the development of fluorescent ligands, has allowed the study of G protein-coupled receptor pharmacology at the single cell and single molecule level. This study evaluated how the physicochemical nature of the linker and the fluorophore affected the pharmacological properties of fluorescent agonists and antagonists. Experimental approach: Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing the human adenosine A(1) receptor and a cyclic 3',5' adenosine monophosphate response element-secreted placental alkaline phosphatase (CRE-SPAP) reporter gene, together with whole cell [H-3]-8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX) radioligand binding, were used to evaluate the pharmacological properties of a range of fluorescent ligands based on the antagonist xanthine amine congener (XAC) and the agonist 5' (N-ethylcarboxamido) adenosine (NECA). Key results: Derivatives of NECA and XAC with different fluorophores, but equivalent linker length, showed significant differences in their binding properties to the adenosine A(1) receptor. The BODIPY 630/650 derivatives had the highest affinity. Linker length also affected the pharmacological properties, depending on the fluorophore used. Particularly in fluorescent agonists, higher agonist potency could be achieved with large or small linkers for dansyl and BODIPY 630/650 derivatives, respectively. Conclusions and implications: The pharmacology of a fluorescent ligand was critically influenced by both the fluorophore and the associated linker. Furthermore, our data strongly suggest that the physicochemical properties of the fluorophore/linker pairing determine where in the environment of the target receptor the fluorophore is placed, and this, together with the environmental sensitivity of the resulting fluorescence, may finally decide its utility as a fluorescent probe.

Lack of effect of the α<sub>2C</sub>-adrenoceptor Del322-325 polymorphism on inhibition of cyclic AMP production in HEK293 cells	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						adrenoceptor; alpha(2C); Del322-325; polymorphism; signalling; heart failure; adenylyl cyclase	ADRENERGIC-RECEPTOR POLYMORPHISMS; HEART-FAILURE; ALPHA(2)-ADRENERGIC RECEPTORS; DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY; DRUG-THERAPY; H-3 RX821002; HUMAN-BRAIN; SUBTYPE; MICE; BINDING	Background and purpose: The alpha(2C)-adrenoceptor has multiple functions, including inhibiting release of noradrenaline from presynaptic nerve terminals. A human alpha(2C) polymorphism, Del322-325, a potential risk factor for heart failure, has been reported to exhibit reduced signalling in CHO cells. To further understand the role of the Del322-325 polymorphism on receptor signalling, we attempted to replicate and further study the reduced signalling in HEK293 cells. Experimental approach: Human alpha(2C) wild-type (WT) and Del322-325 adrenoceptors were stably transfected into HEK293 cells. Radioligand binding was performed to determine affinities for both receptors. In intact cells, inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production by WT and Del322-325 clones with a range of receptor densities (200-2320 fmol . mg(-1) protein) was measured following agonist treatment. Key results: Noradrenaline, brimonidine and clonidine exhibited similar binding affinities for WT and Del322-325. Brimonidine and clonidine also had similar efficacies and potencies for both receptors for the inhibition of cyclic AMP production at all receptor densities tested. A linear regression analysis comparing efficacy and potency with receptor expression levels showed no differences in slopes between WT and Del322-325. Conclusions and implications: The alpha(2C) WT and Del322-325 adrenoceptors exhibited similar binding properties. Additionally, inhibition of cyclic AMP production by Del322-325 was similar to that of WT over a range of receptor densities. Therefore, in intact HEK293 cells, the alpha(2C)-Del322-325 polymorphism does not exhibit reduced signalling to adenylyl cyclase and may not represent a clinically important phenotype.

Characterization of Anandamide-Stimulated Cannabinoid Receptor Signaling in Human ULTR Myometrial Smooth Muscle Cells	MOLECULAR ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article							ACTIVATED PROTEIN-KINASE; BLOOD MONONUCLEAR-CELLS; CB1 RECEPTOR; REGULATED KINASE; MARIJUANA USE; ENDOCANNABINOID SYSTEM; KROX-24 EXPRESSION; PRENATAL EXPOSURE; MESSENGER-RNA; PREGNANCY	Accumulating evidence highlights the importance of the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) as a key mediator in reproductive physiology. Current data suggest potential roles for AEA in gametogenesis, fertilization, and parturition. AEA exerts its actions through two G protein-coupled receptors, termed cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1), and 2 (CB2), and the ligand-gated transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor type 1 (TRPV1) ion channel. At present, the cellular mechanism( s) and consequences of AEA signaling in reproductive tissues, especially the myometrium, are poorly understood. Here, we examine the expression of CB1, CB2, and TRPV1 in the human myometrial smooth muscle cell-line (ULTR) and characterize intracellular signaling after stimulation with AEA. Radioligand binding analysis revealed a total CB receptor expression of 76 +/- 24 fmol/mg protein, with both quantitative PCR and competition binding studies indicating a negligible CB2 component. AEA caused G alpha(i/o)-dependent inhibition of adenylate cyclase to reduce intracellular cAMP levels. In addition, AEA caused a 2.5- to 3.5-fold increase in ERK activation, which was ablated by inhibition of G alpha(i/o), phosphoinositide-3-kinase and Src-kinase activities, but not by inhibition of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase or protein kinase C activities. TRPV1 channel activation with capsaicin failed to activate ERK. Consistent with these findings, the selective agonists, arachidonyl-2-chloroethylamide (CB1) and L759656 (CB2), and selective antagonists AM251 (CB1) and JTE907 (CB2), provided pharmacological evidence that the ERK signaling pathway is activated through endogenously expressed CB1. These findings provide an insight into myometrial AEA signaling, highlighting a potential role for endocannabinoids in the regulation of gene expression in myometrial smooth muscle cells.

Pharmacological profile of essential oils derived from <i>Lavandula angustifolia</i> and <i>Melissa officinalis</i> with anti-agitation properties: focus on ligand-gated channels	JOURNAL OF PHARMACY AND PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; BEHAVIORAL SYMPTOMS; RECEPTOR-BINDING; DOUBLE-BLIND; AROMATHERAPY; CALOPOROSIDE; MODULATION; MANAGEMENT; MECHANISM; DEMENTIA	Both Melissa officinalis (Mo) and Lavandula angustifolia (La) essential oils have putative anti-agitation properties in humans, indicating common components with a depressant action in the central nervous system. A dual radioligand binding and electrophysiological study, focusing on a range of ligand-gated ion channels, was performed with a chemically validated essential oil derived from La, which has shown clinical benefit in treating agitation. La inhibited [S-35] TBPS binding to the rat forebrain gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor channel (apparent IC50 = 0.040 +/- 0.001 mg mL(-1)), but had no effect on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) or nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. A 50:50 mixture of Mo and La essential oils inhibited [H-3] flunitrazepam binding, whereas the individual oils had no significant effect. Electrophysiological analyses with rat cortical primary cultures demonstrated that La reversibly inhibited GABA-incluced currents in a concentration-dependent manner (0.01-1 mg mL(-1)), whereas no inhibition of NMDA- or AMPA-induced currents was noted. La elicited a significant dose-dependent reduction in both inhibitory and excitatory transmission, with a net depressant effect on neurotransmission (in contrast to the classic GABA(A) antagonist picrotoxin which evoked profound epileptiform burst firing in these cells). These properties are similar to those recently reported for Mo. The anti-agitation effects in patients and the depressant effects of La we report in neural membranes in-vitro are unlikely to reflect a sedative interaction with any of the ionotropic receptors examined here. These data suggest that components common to the two oils are worthy of focus to identify the actives underlying the neuronal depressant and anti-agitation activities reported.

Intrathecal administration of the alpha 3 beta 2*/alpha 6 beta 2* selective alpha-conotoxin MII (alpha-CTX MII) dose- and time - dependently reduced paw withdrawal thresholds to mechanical pressure in normal rats. The pronociceptive effect of alpha-CTX MII was partially blocked by NMDA receptor antagonism and lost completely following ablation of C-fibers. The effect of spinal nerve ligation on alpha-CTX MII-induced mechanical hypersensitivity was also assessed. Sensitivity was lost in the hind paw ipsilateral to spinal nerve ligation, but maintained in the contralateral hind paw at control levels. Radioligand binding in spinal cord membranes revealed high and low affinity alpha-CTX MII binding sites. Spinal nerve ligation did not significantly alter alpha-CTX MII binding ipsilateral to ligation. Finally, no evidence for the presence of alpha 6-containing nAChRs was identified. The results of these studies show the presence of 2 populations of alpha-CTX MII-sensitive nAChRs containing the alpha 3 and beta 2, but not the alpha 6, subunits in the rat spinal cord that function to inhibit the transmission of nociceptive mechanical stimuli via inhibiting the release of glutamate from C-fibers. Spinal nerve ligation produces a unilateral loss of alpha-CTX MII-induced mechanical hypersensitivity without altering alpha-CTX MII binding sites. Our data support a peripheral injury-induced loss of a cholinergic inhibitory tone at spinal alpha 3 beta 2* nAChRs, without the loss of the receptors themselves, which may contribute to mechanical hypersensitivity following spinal nerve ligation.

Cortical and subcortical 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor binding in neuroleptic-naive first-episode schizophrenic patients	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						PET; positron emission tomography; serotonin; 5-HT2A receptor; schizophrenia; molecular imaging	OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE SYMPTOMS; SEROTONIN(2A) RECEPTORS; FRONTAL-CORTEX; DOPAMINE D-1; PET IMAGES; METAANALYSIS; ASSOCIATION; CLOZAPINE; DENSITIES; DISORDER	The serotonin 5-HT2A receptor is suspected to be involved in a number of psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia. In particular, atypical antipsychotics have antagonistic effects on the 5-HT2A receptors, supporting a specific role of the 5-HT2A receptor in the pathophysiology of this disease. The aim of this study is to investigate cortical and subcortical 5-HT2A binding in neuroleptic-naive schizophrenic patients. Fifteen neuroleptic-naive patients diagnosed with schizophrenia (age 27.5 +/- 4.5 years), 11 men and 4 women, and 15 healthy control subjects matched for age (28.5 +/- 5.7 years) and gender underwent a 40 min positron emission tomography (PET) study using the 5-HT2A antagonist, [F-18] altanserin, as a radioligand. PET images were co-registered to 3 T magnetic resonance images (MRIs) for each individual subject, and ROIs were applied automatically onto the individual MRIs and PET images. The cerebellum was used as a reference region. The binding potential of specific tracer binding (BPP) was used as the outcome measure. No significant difference was seen in cortical receptor distribution between patients and controls. An increase in 5-HT2A receptor binding in the caudate nucleus was detected in the group of schizophrenic patients (0.7 +/- 0.1) when compared to the healthy controls (0.5 +/- 0.3) (p = 0.02). Our results confirm other in vivo findings of no difference in cortical 5-HT2A receptor binding between first-episode antipsychotic-naive schizophrenic patients and age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects. However, a preliminary finding of increased 5-HT2A binding in the caudate nucleus requires further investigation to explore the relation of subcortical and cortical 5-HT2A receptor binding.

The availability of a positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand would facilitate studies of the addictive and medicinal properties of compounds that bind to this receptor. Among the known classes of ligands for CB1 receptors, the pyrazoles are attractive targets for radiopharmaceutical development because they are antagonists and are generally less lipophilic than the other classes. Methods: A convenient high-yield synthesis of N-(4-[F-18]fluorophenyl)-5-(4-bromoplienyl)-1-(2,4-dichloroplienyl)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide (AM5144) was devised by coupling the appropriate pyrazole-3-carboxyl chloride compound with 4-[F-18]fluoroaniline. The labeled precursor was synthesized from 1-[F-18]fluoro-4-nitrobenzene in 60% radiochemical yield for 10 min using an improved procedure involving sodium borohydride reduction with cobalt chloride catalysis. The product was purified by HPLC to give a specific activity >400 mCi/mu mol and a radiochemical purity >95%, and a PET study was conducted ill a baboon. Results: Although the regional uptake of AM5144 in baboon brain was consistent with binding to cannabinoid CB1 receptors, absolute uptake at <0.003% injected radioactivity per cubic centimeter was lower than the previously reported uptake of the radioiodinated pyrazole AN4281. Conclusions: The relatively poor brain uptake of AM5144 and other pyrazole CB1 receptor ligands is not surprising because of their high lipophilicity as compared with most brain PET radiotracers. However, for nine pyrazole compounds for which rodent data are available, brain uptake and calculated logP values are not correlated. Thus, high logP values should not preclude evaluation of radiotracers for targets such as the CB1 receptor that may require very lipophilic ligands. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Sapindus trifoliatus is a medium-sized deciduous tree growing wild in south India that belongs to the family Sapindaceae. The pericarp is reported for various medicinal properties. A thick aqueous solution of the pericarp is used for the treatment of hemicrania, hysteria or epilepsy in folklore medicine. We have investigated the antihyperalgesic effects of the lyophilized aqueous extract of S. trifoliatus in animal models predictive of experimental migraine models using morphine withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia on the hot-plate test and on 0.3% acetic acid-induced abdominal constrictions in adult male Swiss albino mice. The extract significantly (N = 10, P < 0.05) increased the licking latency in the hot-plate test when administered ip at 10 mg/kg (6.70 +/- 0.39 s in saline control vs 18.76 +/- 0.96 s in S. trifoliatus-treated animals) and significantly (N = 10, P < 0.001) reduced the abdominal constrictions when administered ip at 2 and 10 mg/kg (40.20 +/- 1.36 in saline control vs 30.20 +/- 1.33 and 23.00 +/- 0.98 for 2 and 10 mg/kg, ip, respectively, in S. trifoliatustreated animals). Furthermore, when administered ip at 20 and 100 mg/kg, the extract significantly (N = 10, P < 0.05) inhibited the apomorphine-induced climbing behavior in mice (climbing duration 15.75 +/- 5.0 min for saline control vs 11.4 +/- 1.28 and 3.9 +/- 1.71 min for 20 and 100 mg/kg, respectively, in S. trifoliatus-treated animals). In receptor radioligand-binding studies, the extract exhibited affinity towards D-2 receptors. The findings suggest that dopamine D-2 antagonism could be the mechanism involved in the antihyperalgesic activity of the aqueous extract of S trifoliatus.

These derivatives represent an extension of our previous work on this class of compounds with high affinity toward A(1) adenosine receptors.(19) The results of radioligand binding assays indicate that a large number of the 1,8-naphthyridine derivatives proved to be A(1) selective, with a high affinity toward bovine adenosine receptors in the low nanomolar range, and one (29) in the subnanomolar range. Furthermore, the new series of 1,8-naphthyridine derivatives (29-44 and 46-52), together with the analogous derivatives 1-28 previously studied,(19) were tested to evaluate their affinity toward human cortical A(1) receptors and human striatal A(2A) receptors. The results indicate that all the 1,8-naphthyridine compounds generally possess a higher affinity toward the bovine A(1) receptor compared with the human A(1) receptor. As regards the affinity toward the A(2A) bovine receptor, only a few compounds possess a moderate affinity, which for some compounds remained approximately the same toward the A(2A) human receptor. A molecular modeling study of the docking of the 1,8-naphthyridine compounds with both the bovine and the human A(1) adenosine receptors was carried out with the aim of explaining the marked decrease in the affinity toward human A(1) adenosine receptors in comparison with bovine A(1) adenosine receptors. This study indicated that the structural differences, albeit small, of the active sites of the two receptors make differences in the dimensions of the site and this influenced the ability of the title compounds to interact with the two A(1) receptors.

MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; DOPAMINE RELEASE; MEDIATED RELEASE; SH-SY5Y CELLS; AGONIST; CALCIUM; BINDING; PHYSOSTIGMINE; GALANTHAMINE; SYNAPTOSOMES	Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( nAChR) modulate a variety of cellular responses, including Ca2+ signals and neurotransmitter release, which can influence neuronal processes such as synaptic efficacy and neuroprotection. In addition to receptor activation through the agonist binding site, an allosteric modulation of nAChR has also been described for a novel class of allosteric ligands. Of these, the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and Alzheimer drug galantamine represents the prototypical allosteric ligand, based on its potentiation of nAChR-evoked single-channel and whole-cell currents. The aim of this study was to establish whether the allosteric potentiation of nAChR currents is transduced in downstream cellular responses to nAChR activation, namely increases in intracellular Ca2+ and [H-3] noradrenaline release. In SH-SY5Y cells, galantamine potentiated nicotine-evoked increases in intracellular Ca2+ and [H-3] noradrenaline release with a bell-shaped concentration-response profile; maximum enhancement of nicotine-evoked responses occurred at 1 muM galantamine. This potentiation was blocked by mecamylamine, whereas galantamine had no effect on these measures in the absence of nicotine. Galantamine did not compete for radioligand binding to the agonist binding sites of several nAChR subtypes, consistent with an allosteric mode of action. Unlike galantamine, the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors rivastigmine and donepezil did not potentiate nAChR-mediated responses, whereas donepezil was a reasonably potent inhibitor of nicotine- and KCl-evoked increases in Ca2+. nAChR-mediated [H-3] noradrenaline release from hippocampal slices was also potentiated by galantamine, with an additional component attributable to acetylcholinesterase inhibition and subsequent increase in acetylcholine. These results indicate that the allosteric regulation of nAChR results in the potentiation of receptor-dependent cellular processes relevant to many of the physiological consequences of nAChR activation.

Loss of potassium (K+), chloride (Cl-), and water from RBCs is thought to contribute to the production of these dehydrated cells. One main route of K+ loss in the RBC is the Gardos channel, a calcium (Ca2+)-activated K+ channel. Clotrimazole (CLT), an inhibitor of the Gardos channel, has been shown to reduce RBC dehydration in vitro and in vivo. We have developed a chemically novel compound, ICA-17043, that has greater potency and selectivity than CLT in inhibiting the Gardos channel. ICA-17043 blocked Ca2+-induced rubidium flux from human RBCs with an IC50 value of 11+/-2 nM (CLT IC50=100+/-12 nM) and inhibited RBC dehydration with an IC50 of 30+/-20 nM. In a transgenic mouse model of sickle cell disease (SAD), treatment with ICA-17043 (10 mg/kg orally, twice a day) for 21 days showed a marked and constant inhibition of the Gardos channel activity (with an average inhibition of 90% +/-27%, P<.005), an increase in RBC K+ content (from 392 +/- 19.9 to 479.2 +/- 40 mmol/kg hemoglobin [Hb], P<.005), a significant increase in hematocrit (Hct) (from 0.435+/-0.007 to 0.509+/-0.022 [43.5%+/-0.7% to 50.9%+/-2.2%], P<.005), a decrease in mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) (from 340 +/- 9.0 to 300 +/- 15 g/L [34.0 +/- 0.9 to 30 +/- 1.5 g/dL], P<.05), and a left-shift in RBC density curves. These data indicate that ICA-17043 is a potent inhibitor of the Gardos channel and ameliorates RBC dehydration in the SAD mouse.

The current study evaluates different kinetic modeling strategies for quantification of [C-11]-DASB binding in five healthy humans. Kinetic analyses of tissue data were performed with a one-tissue (1CM) and a two-tissue (2CM) compartment model. Time-activity curves were well described by a 1CM for all regions. A 2CM model with four parameters failed to converge reliably. Reliable fits of the data were obtained only if no more than three parameters were allowed to vary. However, even then, the rate constants k(3) and k(4) were estimated with poor precision. Only the ratio k(3)/k(4) was stable. Goodness of fit was not improved by using a 2CM as compared with a 1CM. The minimal study duration required to obtain stable k(3)/k(4) estimates was 80 minutes. For routine use of [C-11]-DASB, several simplified methods using the cerebellum as a reference region to estimate nonspecific binding were also evaluated. The transient equilibrium, the linear graphical analysis, the ratio of target to reference region, and the simplified reference tissue methods all gave binding potential values consistent with those obtained with the 2CM, The suitability of [C-11]-DASB for research on the SERT using PET is thus supported by the observations that tissue data can be described using a kinetic analysis and that simplified quantitative methods, using the cerebellum as reference, provide reliable estimates of SERT binding parameters.

We ascertained whether CrylF, Cry9C, or Cry9E recognizes the CrylAb binding site on the O. nubilalis brush border by three approaches. An optical biosensor technology based on surface plasmon resonance measured binding of brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) injected over a surface of immobilized Cry toxin. Preincubation with CrylAb reduced BBMV binding to immobilized CrylAb, whereas preincubation with CrylF, Cry9C, or Cry9E did not inhibit BBMV binding. BBMV binding to a CrylF-coated surface was reduced when vesicles were preincubated in CrylF or CrylAb but not Cry9C or Cry9E, A radioligand approach measured I-125-CrylAb toxin binding to BBMV in the presence of homologous (CrylAb) and heterologous (CrylAc, CrylF, Cry9C, or Cry9E) toxins. Unlabeled CrylAc effectively competed for I-125-CrylAb binding in a manner comparable to CrylAb itself, Unlabeled Cry9C and Cry9E toxins did not inhibit I-125-CrylAb binding to BBMV. CrylF inhibited (125)-CrylAb binding at concentrations greater than 500 nM. CrylF had low-level affinity for the CrylAb binding site. Ligand blot analysis identified CrylAb, CrylAc, and CrylF binding proteins in BBMV. The major CrylAb signals on ligand blots were at 145 kDa and 154 kDa, but a strong signal was present at 220 kDa and a weak signal was present at 167 kDa. CrylAc and CrylF binding proteins were detected at 220 and 154 kDa. Anti-Manduca sexta aminopeptidase serum recognized proteins of 145, 154, and 167 kDa, and anti-cadherin serum recognized the 220 Mfa protein. We speculate that isoforms of aminopeptidase and cadherin in the brush border membrane serve as CrylAb, CrylAc, and CrylF binding proteins.

The aim of this study was to compare the frequency of ICA and GADA and/or IA2-ab not only at, but also after the diagnosis of diabetes. ICA, GADA and IA2-ab were therefore assessed at and up to 11 y after the diagnosis of diabetes in 86 children (1-15-y-old). At diagnosis, ICA were found in 74 (86%) and GADA and/or IA2-ab in 79 (92%) of the diabetic children. Hence, there was no major difference in frequency between ICA and GADA and/or IA2-ab at diagnosis of diabetes. At follow-up, however, ICA were less frequent than GADA and/or IA2-ab; 1-3 y after diagnosis ICA were found in 12 (44%) and GADA and/or IA2-ab in 24 (89%) of 27 children (p = 0.001); 4-6 y after diagnosis ICA were found in 7 (24%) and GADA and/or IA2-ab in 27 (93%) of 29 children (p < 0.0001); 7-11 y after diagnosis ICA were found in 4 (13%) and GADA and/or IA2-ab in 21 (70%) of 30 children (p < 0.0001). We conclude that the frequency of ICA does not always correspond to that of GADA and/or IA2-ab. Many years after diagnosis of diabetes, measurements of GADA and IA2-ab, but not ICA, detect autoimmunity in high frequency.

Initial studies have shown promising results with Lutetium-177 prostate-specific membrane antigen (Lu-177-PSMA) therapy for advanced prostate cancer. However, most of the published efficacy and safety data is retrospective. The purpose of the study was to prospectively evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety results of Lu-177-PSMA therapy in mCRPC patients after 2 cycles.Methods Twenty-five patients of mCRPC, treated with standard care treatment were enrolled for 2 cycles of Lu-177-PSMA therapy. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, Visual Analogue Score (VAS) and Analgesic Quantification Scale (AQS) for efficacy and hemoglobin, total leukocyte, platelets and serum creatinine for toxicity were recorded pre and post-therapy. Paired sample t-test was used for statistical analysis.Results Treated patients with mean PSA level of 157 ng/ml received mean dose of 6.84 GBq of Lu-177-PSMA. For PSA, partial response (PR) was seen in 11/25 (44%), stable disease (SD) in 8/25 (32%) and progressive disease (PD) in 6/25 (24%) patients. Grade 1 and 2 hemoglobin toxicity was seen in 5/25 (20%) and 6/25 (24%) patients respectively. No patient developed grade 3 or 4 bone marrow toxicities. Grade 1 and 2 nephrotoxicity was seen in 1 patient each. Statistically significant difference was seen in ECOG, VAS and AQS scores (P < 0.001). No significant nephrotoxicity was observed (P = 0.558).Conclusion Efficacy and safety of Lu-177-PSMA therapy after 2 cycles have shown significant PSA response and pain palliation in heavily pretreated mCRPC patients.

Sulbactam confers neuronal protection against ischemic insults in the hippocampal CA1 region accompanied by the upregulation of GLT-1 expression in rats. The present study further investigates the effect of sulbactam on the binding property and uptake capacity of GLT-1 for glutamate, and the change in extracellular glutamate concentration in the hippocampal CA1 region of rats with global brain ischemia. The binding property and uptake capacity of GLT-1 were measured using a radioligand binding and uptake assay, respectively, with L-H-3-glutamate. The extracellular glutamate concentration was detected using microdialysis and high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Neuropathological evaluation was performed based on thionin staining. It was shown that sulbactam pre-treatment changed GLT-1 binding property, including increased B-max and decreased K-d values, increased GLT-1 uptake capacity for glutamate, and inhibited the elevation of extracellular glutamate concentration in rats with global cerebral ischemia. These effects of sulbactam were accompanied by its neuronal protection on the hippocampal CA1 neurons against delayed neuronal death resulted from ischemic insult. Furthermore, administration of GLT-1 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, which inhibited the expression of GLT-1, blocked the aforementioned sulbactam-related effects, which suggested that GLT-1 upregulation mediated the above effect although other mechanisms independent of the upregulation of GLT-1 expression could not be excluded. It could be concluded that sulbactam improves the binding property and uptake capacity of GLT-1 for glutamate and then reduces the glutamate concentration and excitotoxicity during global cerebral ischemia, which contributes to the neuroprotection of sulbactam against brain ischemia.

J	Mizutani, H; Sakakibara, F; Sasaki, E				Mizutani, Hiroya; Sakakibara, Fukumitsu; Sasaki, Eiji			TAS-303 Ameliorates Carbachol-Induced Detrusor Overactivity in Rats, Revealing Its Therapeutic Potential for Overactive Bladder	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							BETA-ADRENOCEPTOR SUBTYPES; URINARY-TRACT SYMPTOMS; AFFERENT ACTIVITY; BETA(3)-ADRENOCEPTOR AGONIST; MUSCARINIC RECEPTORS; MIRABEGRON; EXPRESSION; RELEASE; INHIBITION; STIMULATION	Urinary incontinence is defined as an involuntary leakage of urine and is categorized into three types: stress urinary incontinence (SUI), urge urinary incontinence (UUI), and mixed urinary incontinence, which includes symptoms of SUI and UUI. As the underlying mechanisms of SUI and UUI are different, no drug is approved to treat all three types of urinary incontinence. TAS303 is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and has therapeutic potential for patients with SUI. In this report, we describe newly discovered pharmacological properties of TAS303 and its effects on bladder function. Radioligand binding studies showed that TAS-303 inhibits M3 muscarinic receptor binding, with a Ki value of 547 n M. TAS-303 at 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg dose-dependently prolonged the intercontraction interval of carbachol-induced detrusor overactivity in rats, exhibiting a maximal effect that was comparable to tolterodine. These effects may result from coordinated regulation of bladder afferent activity via M3 muscarinic inhibition and beta 3 adrenoreceptor activation by norepinephrine elevation due to norepinephrine transporter inhibition. Moreover, TAS-303 at the effective dose for bladder function did not induce dry mouth or constipation in rats, showing that this compound may have a lower risk of antimuscarinic side effects. Thus, TAS-303 is expected to be a new profile agent with therapeutic potential for all types of urinary incontinence. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Urinary incontinence is categorized into stress, urge, and mixed urinary incontinence, but because the underlying mechanisms of each differ, no drugs are available that treat all three. TAS-303 has therapeutic potential for stress urinary incontinence. This study describes newly discovered pharmacological properties of TAS-303, which ameliorated bladder afferent activity partly via M3 muscarinic inhibition, indicating improvement in urge urinary incontinence, and highlights the potential of TAS-303 as a new therapeutic agent for all types of urinary incontinence.

Substituted 4-phenylthiazoles: Development of potent and selective A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>3</sub> and dual A<sub>1</sub>/A<sub>3</sub> adenosine receptor antagonists	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Adenosine receptors; A(1) adenosine receptor; A(3) adenosine receptor antagonist; Allosteric modulator; Alzheimer's disease; Inverse agonist; Multi-target drugs; Selectivity; Species differences; Structure-activity relationships; Synthesis; Thiazole	ACUTE HEART-FAILURE; A(2A) RECEPTOR; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; ROLOFYLLINE; RADIOLIGAND; DERIVATIVES; AFFINITY; BINDING; FORCE; CAFFEINE	Adenosine acts as a powerful signaling molecule via four distinct G protein-coupled receptors, designated A(1), A(2A), A(2B) and A(3) adenosine receptors (ARs). A(2A) and A(2B) ARs are G(s)-coupled, while A(1) and A(3) ARs inhibit cAMP production via G, proteins. Antagonists for A(1) and A(3) ARs may be useful for the treatment of (neuro)inflammatory diseases including acute kidney injury and kidney failure, pulmonary diseases, and Alzheimer's disease. In the present study, we optimized the versatile 2-amino-4-phenylthiazole scaffold by introducing substituents at N2 and C5 to obtain A t and A3 AR antagonists including dual-target compounds. Selective A(1) antagonists with (sub)nanomolar potency were produced, e.g. 11 and 13. These compounds showed species differences being significantly more potent at the rat as compared to the human A(1) AR, and were characterized as inverse agonists. Several potent and selective A(3) AR antagonists, e.g. 7, 8, 17 and 22 (K-i values of 5-9 nM at the human A(3) AR) were prepared, which were much less potent at the rat orthologue. Moreover, dual A(1)/A(3) antagonists (10, 18) were developed showing K-i values between 8 and 42 nM. Docking and molecule dynamic simulation studies using the crystal structure of the A(1) AR and a homology model of the A(3) AR were performed to rationalize the observed structure-activity relationships.

Studies have implicated 11 beta-HSD1 in metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes and obesity, as well as stress-related disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, such as depression and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have previously developed [C-11]AS2471907 as a PET radiotracer to image 11 beta-HSD1 in the brain of nonhuman primates and humans. However, the radiosynthesis of [C-11]AS2471907 was unreliable and low-yielding. Here, we report the development of the F-18-labeled version [F-18]AS2471907, including the synthesis of two iodonium ylide precursors and the optimization of F-18-radiosynthesis. Preliminary PET experiments, composed of a baseline scan of [F-18]AS2471907 and a blocking scan with the reversible 11 beta-HSD1 inhibitor ASP3662 (0.3 mg/kg), was also conducted in a rhesus monkey to verify the pharmacokinetics of [F-18]AS2471907 and its specific binding in the brain. The iodonium ylide precursors were prepared in a seven-step synthetic route with an optimized overall yield of similar to 2% [F-18]AS2471907 was synthesized in good radiochemical purity, with the ortho regioisomer of iodonium ylide providing greater radiochemical yield as compared with the para regioisomer. In monkey brain, [F-18]AS2471907 displayed high uptake and heterogeneous distribution, while administration of the 11 beta-HSD1 inhibitor ASP3662 significantly reduced radiotracer uptake, thus demonstrating the binding specificity of [F-18]AS2471907. Given the longer half-life of F-18 and feasibility for central production and distribution, [F-18]AS2471907 holds great promise to be a valuable PET radiotracer to image 11 beta-HSD1 in the brain.

In-111-F(ab)(2)-cetuximab tumor targeting and biodistribution were evaluated by SPECT in BalbC nude mice bearing primary colorectal tumors. The efficacy of In-111-F(ab)(2)-cetuximab to assess therapy efficacy was performed on BalbC nude mice bearing colorectal tumors receiving 17-DMAG, an HSP90 inhibitor. Therapeutic efficacy of the radioimmunotherapy based on Lu-177-F(ab)(2)-cetuximab was evaluated in SWISS nude mice bearing A431 tumors.ResultsRadiolabeling procedure did not change F(ab)(2)-cetuximab and cetuximab immunoreactivity nor affinity for HER1 in vitro. In-111-DOTAGA-F(ab)(2)-cetuximab exhibited a peak tumor uptake at 24h post-injection and showed a high tumor specificity determined by a significant decrease in tumor uptake after the addition of an excess of unlabeled-DOTAGA-F(ab)(2)-cetuximab. SPECT imaging of In-111-DOTAGA-F(ab)(2)-cetuximab allowed an accurate evaluation of tumor growth and successfully predicted the decrease in tumor growth induced by 17-DMAG. Finally, Lu-177-DOTAGA-F(ab)(2)-cetuximab radioimmunotherapy showed a significant reduction of tumor growth at 4 and 8MBq doses.Conclusions(111)In-DOTAGA-F(ab)(2)-cetuximab is a reliable and stable tool for specific in vivo tumor targeting and is suitable for therapy efficacy assessment. Lu-177-DOTAGA-F(ab)(2)-cetuximab is an interesting theranostic tool allowing therapy and imaging.

In this study, we investigated the effect of a 10-day treatment with high doses of morphine (10 mg/kg per day) on major components and functional state of the beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) signaling system in the rat cerebral cortex. beta-ARs were characterized by radioligand binding assays and amounts of various G protein subunits, adenylyl cyclase (AC) isoforms, G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), and beta-arrestin were examined by Western blot analysis. AC activity was determined as a measure of functionality of the signaling system. We also assessed the partitioning of selected signaling proteins between the lipid raft and non-raft fractions prepared from cerebrocortical plasma membranes. Morphine treatment resulted in a significant upregulation of beta-ARs, GRK3, and some AC isoforms (AC-I, -II, and -III). There was no change in quantity of G proteins and some other signaling molecules (AC-IV, AC-V/VI, GRK2, GRK5, GRK6, and beta-arrestin) compared with controls. Interestingly, morphine exposure caused a partial redistribution of beta-ARs, G(s)alpha, G(o)alpha, and GRK2 between lipid rafts and bulk plasma membranes. Spatial localization of other signaling molecules within the plasma membrane was not changed. Basal as well as fluoride- and forskolin-stimulated AC activities were not significantly different in membrane preparations from control and morphine-treated animals. However, AC activity stimulated by the beta-AR agonist isoprenaline was markedly increased. This is the first study to demonstrate lipid raft association of key components of the cortical beta-AR system and its sensitivity to morphine.

The Immune Response of the Human Brain to Abdominal Surgery	ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; POSTOPERATIVE COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION; PROTEIN 18 KDA; VIVO RADIOLIGAND BINDING; IN-VIVO; TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; MICROGLIAL ACTIVATION; BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTORS; NEUROFILAMENT LIGHT	Objective: Surgery launches a systemic inflammatory reaction that reaches the brain and associates with immune activation and cognitive decline. Although preclinical studies have in part described this systemic-to-brain signaling pathway, we lack information on how these changes appear in humans. This study examines the short-and long-term impact of abdominal surgery on the human brain immune system by positron emission tomography (PET) in relation to blood immune reactivity, plasma inflammatory biomarkers, and cognitive function. Methods: Eight males undergoing prostatectomy under general anesthesia were included. Prior to surgery (baseline), at postoperative days 3 to 4, and after 3 months, patients were examined using [C-11]PBR28 brain PET imaging to assess brain immune cell activation. Concurrently, systemic inflammatory biomarkers, ex vivo blood tests on immunoreactivity to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, and cognitive function were assessed. Results: Patients showed a global downregulation of gray matter [C-11]PBR28 binding of 26 +/- 26% (mean +/- standard deviation) at 3 to 4 days postoperatively compared to baseline (p=0.023), recovering or even increasing after 3 months. LPS-induced release of the proinflammatory marker tumor necrosis factor-a in blood displayed a reduction (41 +/- 39%) on the 3rd to 4th postoperative day, corresponding to changes in [C-11]PBR28 distribution volume. Change in Stroop Color-Word Test performance between postoperative days 3 to 4 and 3 months correlated to change in [C-11]PBR28 binding (p=0.027). Interpretation: This study translates preclinical data on changes in the brain immune system after surgery to humans, and suggests an interplay between the human brain and the inflammatory response of the peripheral innate immune system. These findings may be related to postsurgical impairments of cognitive function.

Alterations in DRN 5-HT1A receptor availability cause phenotypes characterized by fearful behavior in preclinical models. However, it is unknown whether 5-HT1A receptor availability is linked specifically to the processing of aversive emotions in humans or whether it modulates connectivity in brain networks involved in emotion processing. To answer this question, we investigated the relationship between DRN 5-HT1A receptor availability and amygdala reactivity to aversive emotion and functional connectivity within the amygdala-cortical network. METHODS: We studied 15 healthy human participants who underwent positron emission tomography scanning with [C-11]CUMI-101, a 5-HT1A partial agonist radioligand, and functional magnetic resonance imaging of brain responses during an incidental emotion processing task including happy, fearful, and neutral faces. Regional estimates of 5-HT1A receptor binding potential (nondisplaceable) were obtained by calculating total volumes of distribution for presynaptic DRN and amygdala. Connectivity between the amygdala and corticolimbic areas was assessed using psychophysiologic interaction analysis with the amygdala as the seed region. RESULTS: Analysis of the fear versus neutral contrast revealed a significant negative correlation between amygdala response and DRN binding potential (nondisplaceable) (r = 2.87, p < .001). Availability of DRN 5-HT1A receptors positively correlated with amygdala connectivity with middle frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex, bilateral precuneus, and left supramarginal gyrus for fearful (relative to neutral) faces. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that DRN 5-HT1A receptor availability is linked specifically to the processing of aversive emotions in the amygdala and the modulation of amygdala-cortical connectivity.

J	Spahn, V; Stein, C; Zöllner, C				Spahn, Viola; Stein, Christoph; Zoellner, Christian			Modulation of Transient Receptor Vanilloid 1 Activity by Transient Receptor Potential Ankyrin 1	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							DEPENDENT PROTEIN-KINASE; CAPSAICIN-ACTIVATED CURRENTS; ROOT GANGLION NEURONS; RAT SENSORY NEURONS; ION-CHANNEL TRPA1; PAIN PATHWAY; MUSTARD OIL; TRPV1; DESENSITIZATION; COLD	Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) is a nonselective ligand-gated cation channel responding to noxious heat, protons, and chemicals such as capsaicin. TRPV1 is expressed in sensory neurons and plays a critical role in pain associated with tissue injury, inflammation, and nerve lesions. Transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) is coexpressed with TRPV1. It is activated by compounds that cause a burning sensation (e. g., mustard oil) and, indirectly, by components of the inflammatory milieu eliciting nociceptor excitation and pain hypersensitivity. Previous studies indicate an interaction of TRPV1 and TRPA1 signaling pathways. Here we sought to examine the molecular mechanisms underlying such interactions in nociceptive neurons. We first excluded physical interactions of both channels using radioligand binding studies. By microfluorimetry, electrophysiological experiments, cAMP measurements, and site-directed mutagenesis we found a sensitization of TRPV1 after TRPA1 stimulation with mustard oil in a calciumand cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent manner. TRPA1 stimulation enhanced TRPV1 phosphorylation via the putative PKA phosphorylation site serine 116. We also detected calcium-sensitive increased TRPV1 activity after TRPA1 activation in dorsal root ganglion neurons. The inhibition of TRPA1 by HC-030031 (1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-1,3-dimethyl-N-[4-(1-methylethyl)phenyl]-2,6-dioxo-7H-purine-7acetamide, 2-(1,3-dimethyl-2,6-dioxo-1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-7H-purin-7-yl)-N-(4-isopropylphenyl) acetamide) after its initial stimulation (and the calcium-insensitive TRPA1 mutant D477A) still showed increased capsaicin-induced TRPV1 activity. This excludes a calcium-induced additive TRPA1 current after TRPV1 stimulation. Our study shows sensitization of TRPV1 via activation of TRPA1, which involves adenylyl cyclase, increased cAMP, subsequent translocation and activation of PKA, and phosphorylation of TRPV1 at PKA phosphorylation residues. This suggests that cross-sensitization of TRP channels contributes to enhanced pain sensitivity in inflamed tissues.

Quinacrine clearly stained A beta plaques in the brain sections of A beta deposition model transgenic mice (Tg2576 mice). Similarly, the quinacrine analog, 2-methoxy-9-(4-(dimethyl-1-methyl) -N-butyl) amino-6-iodo acridine (5), labeled A beta plaques in the brain slices of Tg2576 mice. In addition, [I-125]5 showed modest affinity for A beta(1-42) aggregates with a K-d value of 48 nM. Biodistribution studies using normal mice demonstrated that [I-125]5 displayed poor initial brain uptake. Next, I-125-labeled acridines without aliphatic amino groups were synthesized and characterized. Similar to quinacrine and 5, these compounds could detect A beta plaques in the brain sections of Tg2576 mice. It should be noted that the acridines showed much higher binding affinity for A beta aggregates and greater in vivo blood brain barrier permeability than [I-125]5. Among them, 13 (6-Iodo-2-methoxy-9-methylaminoacridine) and 25 (2,9-Dimethoxy-6-iodo acridine) exhibited high affinity for the A beta aggregates with K-i values of 14 and 29 nM, respectively. In the in vivo studies, [I-125]13 and [I-125]25 showed excellent initial brain uptake (3.0 and 4.4% dose/g, respectively, at 2 min) with fast washout from the brain (0.33 and 0.37% dose/g, respectively, at 60 min). These acridine derivatives are demonstrated to be promising SPECT imaging probes for amyloid in the living brain. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between glucose homeostasis and the endocrine IGF-I axis in Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. The plasma levels of glucose, insulin, growth hormone, free IGF-I, total IGF-I (associated to insulin-like growth factor binding proteins plus free), and corticosterone were measured in 13-week-old ZDF rats and in age-matched controls under fasting and postprandial conditions. The plasma IGF-I binding capacity was measured by radioligand binding. In ZDF rats, fasting total and free IGF-I levels were reduced by 22% and 92%, respectively, compared with controls. Postprandial free IGF-I was reduced by 35%, whereas total IGF-I was unaffected. The plasma IGF-I binding capacity in ZDF rats was reduced by 24% after fasting and by 13% under postprandial conditions. A clear correlation between free IGF-I and insulin was observed in postprandial controls but not in ZDF rats. A principal component analysis clearly separated ZDF and control rats into 2 main components under both fasting and postprandial conditions. The first component was determined equally by total IGF-I, bound IGF-I, the free to total IGF-I ratio, and the IGF-I binding capacity. The second component was determined mostly by glucose and insulin. Our results show a marked alteration of the plasma IGF-I levels and of the capacity of plasma to bind IGF-I, and a disturbed relationship between IGF-I and postprandial insulinemia in a rat model of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

At the dopamine D-2S receptor, this voltage sensitivity is agonist-specific; some agonists, including dopamine, exhibit decreased potency at depolarized potentials, whereas others are not significantly affected. In the present study, we examined some of the receptor-agonist interactions contributing to these differences, and investigated how dopamine D-2S receptor voltage sensitivity affects clinically used dopamine agonists. GIRK channel activation in voltage-clamped Xenopus oocytes was used as readout of receptor activation. Structurally distinct agonists and complementary site-directed mutagenesis of the receptor's binding site were used to investigate the role of agonist-receptor interactions. We also confirmed that the depolarization-induced decrease of dopamine potency in GIRK activation is correlated by decreased binding of radiolabeled dopamine, and by decreased potency in G protein activation. In the mutagenesis experiments, a conserved serine residue as well as the conserved aspartate in the receptor's binding site were found to be important for voltage sensitive potency of dopamine. Furthermore, the voltage sensitivity of the receptor had distinct effects on different therapeutic D-2 agonists. Depolarization decreased the potency of several compounds, whereas for others, efficacy was reduced. For some agonists, both potency and efficacy were diminished, whereas for others still, neither parameter was significantly altered. The present work identifies some of the ligand receptor interactions which determine agonist-specific effects of voltage at the dopamine D-2S receptor. The observed differences between therapeutic agonists might be clinically relevant, and make them potential tools for investigating the roles of dopamine D-2 receptor voltage sensitivity in native tissue.

In this study, we replicated this finding with a primary focus on recent onset cases. Participants and Methods: Participants included (1) 90 cases with cataplexy, (2) 57 cases without cataplexy, and (3) 156 age-sex matched controls, including 73 human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQB1*0602 allele carriers. A radioligand binding assay was used to detect anti-TRIB2 antibodies. Results: Anti-TRIB2 antibodies were prevalent in HLA-DQB1*0602 positive cases with cataplexy (25.0% of 76) and rare in cases without cataplexy (3.5% of 57, OR = 9.2, 95% CI = 2.5 - 33.5, P = 6.0 x 10(-4)) or controls (4.5% of 156, OR = 7.1, 95% CI = 3.1 - 16.2, P = 9.3 x 10(-6)). Anti-TRIB2 positivity in controls was not associated with DQB1*0602. In DQB1*0602 narcolepsy-cataplexy cases, the presence of anti-TRIB2 was associated with short disease duration (2.3 years from cataplexy onset), with 41.0% positive in this group (OR = 7.4 versus cases with onset > 2.3 years, 95% CI = 1.9 - 28.5, P = 9.0 x 10(-4)). Anti-TRIB2 positivity in 39 DQB1*0602 positive recent onset cases was associated with increased ASO antibody (> 200 IU) (OR = 6.2, 95% CI = 1.6 - 24.6, P = 0.01), but did not correlate with age, gender, or body mass index. Conclusion: Anti-TRIB2 autoantibodies are strongly associated with narcolepsy close to cataplexy onset (<= 2.3 years). Anti-TRIB2 was rarely found in cases without cataplexy or with distant onset.

Anti-Inflammatory Role of the Murine Formyl-Peptide Receptor 2: Ligand-Specific Effects on Leukocyte Responses and Experimental Inflammation	JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article							N-FORMYLPEPTIDE RECEPTOR; SERUM-AMYLOID-A; ASPIRIN-TRIGGERED LIPOXINS; PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR; A(4) RECEPTOR; IN-VIVO; UP-REGULATION; LIPOCORTIN 1; RESOLUTION; ACTIVATION	The human formyl-peptide receptor (FPR)-2 is a G protein-coupled receptor that transduces signals from lipoxin A(4), annexin A1, and serum amyloid A (SAA) to regulate inflammation. In this study, we report the creation of a novel mouse colony in which the murine FprL1 FPR2 homologue, Fpr2, has been deleted and describe its use to explore the biology of this receptor. Deletion of murine fpr2 was verified by Southern blot analysis and PCR, and the functional absence of the G protein-coupled receptor was confirmed by radioligand binding assays. In vitro, Fpr2(-/-) macrophages had a diminished response to formyl-Met-Leu-Phe itself and did not respond to SAA-induced chemotaxis. ERK phosphorylation triggered by SAA was unchanged, but that induced by the annexin A1-derived peptide Ac2-26 or other Fpr2 ligands, such as W-peptide and compound 43, was attenuated markedly. In vivo, the antimigratory properties of compound 43, lipoxin A(4), annexin A1, and dexamethasone were reduced notably in Fpr2(-/-) mice compared with those in wild-type littermates. In contrast, SAA stimulated neutrophil recruitment, but the promigratory effect was lost following Fpr2 deletion. Inflammation was more marked in Fpr2(-/-) mice, with a pronounced increase in cell adherence and emigration in the mesenteric microcirculation after an ischemia-reperfusion insult and an augmented acute response to carrageenan-induced paw edema, compared with that in wild-type controls. Finally, Fpr2(-/-) mice exhibited higher sensitivity to arthrogenic serum and were completely unable to resolve this chronic pathology. We conclude that Fpr2 is an anti-inflammatory receptor that serves varied regulatory functions during the host defense response. These data support the development of Fpr2 agonists as novel anti-inflammatory therapeutics. The Journal of Immunology, 2010,184: 2611-2619.

In particular, activation of AT(1) receptors in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) has been suggested to contribute to hypertension. However, the characteristics of AT(1) receptors in the RVLM of rat, the species in which the most experimental work has been done, are not well documented. This study evaluated AT(1) receptor binding along a 2.7-mm length of rat medulla, which included the full extent of the RVLM and the caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM). Sections of medulla from female rats cut on a cryostat were incubated with five concentrations of I-125-sarcosine(1), isoleucine(8) angiotensin II to assess the density (B-max) and dissociation constant (K-D) of the receptors for the radioligand. The dorsomedial medulla (DMM) displayed a high density of AT(1) binding (1207 +/- 100 fmol/g), which peaked at 0.4 mm rostral to the calamus scriptorius (approximately 14 mm caudal to Bregma). The RVLM and CVLM displayed significantly lower (p < 0.01) densities of AT(1) binding, 278 +/- 38 and 379 +/- 64 fmol/g, respectively. However, the dissociation constants were significantly lower (i.e., higher affinity) in RVLM and CVLM (164 +/- 38 and 178 +/- 27 pM, respectively,) than in DMM (328 +/- 12 pM, p<0.01 and p<0.05, respectively). These results provide an anatomical and pharmacological framework for future studies on the role in cardiovascular regulation of AT(1) receptors in the caudal brainstem. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Increased binding to 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors is associated with large vessel infarction and relative preservation of cognition	BRAIN			English	Article						vascular dementia; stroke; serotonin; cognition	SUBCORTICAL VASCULAR DEMENTIA; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; GERBIL HIPPOCAMPUS; CEREBRAL INFARCTS; SEROTONIN; ANTAGONIST; PERFORMANCE; LECOZOTAN; EFFICACY; CRITERIA	Vascular dementia accounts for similar to 15-20% of all dementias. In addition, a significant subset of people with Alzheimer's disease have concurrent cerebrovascular disease. Vascular dementia is caused by different cerebrovascular morphological abnormalities including large artery territory infarction (multi-infarct vascular dementia) and sub-cortical ischaemic vascular dementia. Despite this distinction, there is a lack of studies examining the neurochemistry of individual vascular dementia subtypes. Serotonin is believed to play an important role in cognition, and serotonin receptors may provide a novel target for future anti-dementia therapeutics. This study aimed to determine levels of two serotonin receptors in subtypes of vascular dementia and relate any changes to cognition. We have determined, using saturation radioligand binding, the binding parameters (affinity and maximal binding) of (H-3)-WAY 100635 binding to 5-HT1A receptors and (H-3)-ketanserin binding to 5-HT2A receptors in post-mortem tissue from the frontal and temporal cortices of patients with either multi-infarct vascular dementia, sub-cortical ischaemic vascular dementia, mixed Alzheimer's disease/vascular dementia or stroke no dementia (SND). 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptor binding was significantly increased in the temporal cortex of patients with either multi-infarct vascular dementia or SND, compared to age-matched controls. 5-HT1A receptor maximal binding in the temporal cortex was also positively correlated with cognition as determined by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Cambridge Assessment of Mental Health for the Elderly scores (CAMCOG). These results reveal an important distinction between the neurochemistry of multi-infarct vascular dementia/SND and sub-cortical ischaemic vascular dementia, suggesting that pharmacological manipulation of serotonin offers the possibility to develop novel therapies for stroke and multi-infarct vascular dementia patients. The results also highlight the importance of the cortical 5-HT1A receptor in mediating cognition.	[Elliott, Mark S.

Mechanism of action of species-selective P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor antagonists	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						P2X(7); ATP; BzATP; AZ11645373; GW791343; species selectivity	DISCOVERY; IDENTIFICATION; CLONING; POTENT; PAIN	AZ11645373 and N-{2-methyl-5-[(1R, 5S)-9-oxa-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]non-3-ylcarbonyl]phenyl}-2-tricyclo[3.3.1.13,7]dec-1-ylacetamide hydrochloride (compound-22) are recently described P2X(7) receptor antagonists. In this study we have further characterized these compounds to determine their mechanism of action and interaction with other species orthologues. Antagonist effects at recombinant and chimeric P2X(7) receptors were assessed by ethidium accumulation and radioligand-binding studies. AZ11645373 and compound-22 were confirmed as selective non-competitive antagonists of human or rat P2X(7) receptors respectively. Both compounds were weak antagonists of the mouse and guinea-pig P2X(7) receptors and, for each compound, their potency estimates at human and dog P2X(7) receptors were similar. The potency of compound-22 was moderately temperature-dependent while that of AZ11645373 was not. The antagonist effects of both compounds were slowly reversible and were not prevented by decavanadate, suggesting that they were allosteric antagonists. Indeed, the compounds competed for binding sites labelled by an allosteric radio-labelled P2X(7) receptor antagonist. The species selectivity of AZ11645373, but not compound-22, was influenced by the nature of the amino acid at position 95 of the P2X(7) receptor. N-2-(3,4-difluorophenyl)-N-1-[2-methyl-5-(1-piperazinylmethyl)phenyl]glycinamide dihydrochloride, a positive allosteric modulator of the rat receptor, reduced the potency of compound-22 at the rat receptor but had little effect on the actions of AZ11645373. AZ11645373 and compound-22 are allosteric antagonists of human and rat P2X(7) receptors respectively. The differential interaction of the two compounds with the receptor suggests there may be more than one allosteric regulatory site on the P2X(7) receptor at which antagonists can bind and affect receptor function.

Prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> couples through EP<sub>4</sub> prostanoid receptors to induce IL-8 production in human colonic epithelial cell lines	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						PGE(2); IL-8; EP receptors; colonic epithelial cells	SMOOTH-MUSCLE-CELLS; RNA INTERFERENCE; GENE-EXPRESSION; INFLAMMATION; COLITIS; RELEASE; GROWTH	Prostaglandin (PG) E-2 and interleukin (IL)-8 are simultaneously increased during the inflammation that characterizes numerous pathologies such as inflammatory bowel disease. IL-8 is a potent neutrophil chemo-attractant and activator, and can initiate and/or exacerbate tissue injury. PGE(2) signals principally through prostanoid receptors of the EP2 and/or EP4 subtypes to promote cAMP-dependent cellular functions. The aim of this study was to identify the role of the EP2 and EP4 receptor subtype(s) on two human colonic epithelial cell lines (Caco-2 and T84), in regulating PGE(2)-induced IL-8 production. To identify the causative receptor, we knocked-down and over-expressed EP2 and EP4 receptor subtypes in colonic epithelial cells and studied the effect of several selective EP2/EP4 receptor agonists and antagonists. The inductions of IL-8 and EP receptor mRNA and protein expression were determined by real-time PCR and western blot analysis. The affinity of PGE(2) and Bmax values for the EP2 and EP4 receptor on colonic epithelial cells were determined by radioligand-binding assays with [H-3]PGE(2). PGE(2) had the highest affinity for the EP4 receptor subtype and promoted a robust stimulation of cAMP-dependent IL-8 synthesis. This effect was mimicked by a selective EP4 receptor agonist, ONO-AE1-329, and abolished by silencing the EP4 receptor gene by using siRNA techniques, a selective EP4 receptor antagonist (ONO-AE3-208) and a selective inhibitor (Rp-cAMP) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. These findings suggest that initiation and progression of colonic inflammation induced by IL-8 could be mediated, at least in part, by PGE(2) acting via the EP4 receptor subtype.

Pharmacology and antitussive efficacy of 4-(3-trifluoromethylpyridin2-yl)-piperazine-1-carboxylic acid (5-trifluoromethylpyridin2-yl)-amide (JNJ17203212), a transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 antagonist in guinea pigs	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							CAPSAICIN RECEPTOR; TRPV1 ANTAGONIST; COUGH REFLEX; CITRIC-ACID; CAPSAZEPINE; CHANNEL; VR1; NERVES; HEAT; PAIN	Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) plays an integral role in modulating the cough reflex, and it is an attractive antitussive drug target. The purpose of this study was to characterize a TRPV1 antagonist, 4-(3-trifluoromethyl-pyridin-2-yl)piperazine- 1-carboxylic acid (5-trifluoromethyl-pyridin-2-yl)amide ( JNJ17203212), against the guinea pig TRPV1 receptor in vitro followed by a proof-of-principle study in an acid-induced model of cough. The affinity of JNJ17203212 for the recombinant guinea pig TRPV1 receptor was estimated by radioligand binding, and it was functionally characterized by antagonism of low-pH and capsaicin-induced activation of the ion channel (fluorometric imaging plate reader and electrophysiology). The nature of antagonism was further tested against the native channel in isolated guinea pig tracheal rings. Following pharmacokinetic characterization of JNJ17203212 in guinea pigs, pharmacodynamic and efficacy studies were undertaken to establish the antitussive efficacy of the TRPV1 antagonist. The pK(i) of JNJ17203212 for recombinant guinea pig TRPV1 was 7.14 +/- 0.06. JNJ17203212 inhibited both pH (pIC(50) of 7.23 +/- 0.05) and capsaicin (pIC(50) of 6.32 +/- 0.06)-induced channel activation. In whole-cell patch clamp, the pIC(50) for inhibition of guinea pig TRPV1 was 7.3 +/- 0.01. JNJ17203212 demonstrated surmountable antagonism in isolated trachea, with a pK(B) value of 6.2 +/- 0.1. Intraperitoneal administration of 20 mg/kg JNJ17203212 achieved a maximal plasma exposure of 8.0 +/- 0.4 mu M, and it attenuated capsaicin evoked coughs with similar efficacy to codeine (25 mg/ kg). Last, JNJ17203212 dose-dependently produced antitussive efficacy in citric acid-induced experimental cough in guinea pigs. Our data provide preclinical support for developing TRPV1 antagonists for the treatment of cough.

A role of SRIF in the control of seizures has been proposed, although its exact contribution requires some clarification. In particular, SRIF knockout (KO) mice do not exhibit spontaneous seizures, indicating that compensatory changes may occur in KO. In the KO hippocampus, we examined whether specific SRIF receptors and/or the cognate peptide cortistatin-14 (CST) compensate for the absence of SRIF. We found increased levels of both sst(2) receptors (sst(2)) and CST, and we explored the functional consequences of sst(2) compensation on bursting activity and synaptic responses in hippocampal slices. Bursting was decreased by SRIF in wild-type (WT) mice, but it was not affected by either CST or sst(2) agonist and antagonist. sst(4) agonist increased bursting frequency in either WT or KO. In WT, but not in KO, its effects were blocked by agonizing or antagonizing sst(2), suggesting that sst(2) and sst(4) are functionally coupled in the WT hippocampus. Bursting was reduced in KO as compared with WT and was increased upon application of sst(2) antagonist, while SRIF, CST and sst(2) agonist had no effect. At the synaptic level, we observed that in WT, SRIF decreased excitatory postsynaptic potentials which were, in contrast, increased by sst(2) antagonist in KO. We conclude that sst(2) compensates for SRIF absence and that its upregulation is responsible for reduced bursting and decreased excitatory transmission in KO mice. We suggest that a critical density of sst(2) is needed to control hippocampal activity.

It is, however, currently unknown to what extent data obtained with either tracer are directly comparable. The aim of this study was to compare binding characteristics of these two radiotracers in rat brain with respect to affinity (K-d), receptor binding density (B-max), binding potential (BP), and nonspecific binding. Further, binding kinetics, sensitivity towards competition with the endogenous transmitter serotonin, and the competitive/noncompetitive interaction between the two radioligands were evaluated. In addition, the selectivity of [F-18]altanserin for the 5-HT2A receptor was assessed. The Kd value of [F-18]altanserin and [H-3]MDL 100907 was in the order of 0.3 nM. B-max in frontal cortex was 523 and 527 fmol/mg protein, respectively. The binding of [F-18]altanserin was not influenced by blocking either the 5-HT2B/2C or the alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors. At 37 degrees C the association t(1/2) was 2.8 and 2.7 min and the dissociation t(1/2) was 11 and 13.5 min for [F-18]altanserin and [H-3]MDL 100907, respectively. Both radioligands were displaced by 5-HT, only at high concentrations; the K-i value of 5-HT ranging between 650 and 3,300 nM. This indicates that binding of both radioligands in PET studies is not directly influenced by changes in endogenous 5-HT. Overall, the binding of [F-18]altanserin and [H-3]MDL 100907 to the 5-HT2A receptor was very comparable, showing selective high affinity binding in the subnanomolar range.

This protein was 89% identical to the human and 85% identical to the rat CCK1 receptor. 3 The canine CCK1 receptor was expressed in CHO-K cells for pharmacological characterization. In competition studies, using [I-125] BH-CCK-8S as radioligand, the affinity values estimated for CCK receptor-selective compoundswere not significantly different between the canine and human CCK1 receptors (pK(I) +/- s. e. m. at canine CCK1 receptor; L-364,718 = 8.82 +/- 0.08, L-365,260 = 6.61 +/- 0.05, YF476 = 7.91 +/- 0.15, YM022 = 8.28 +/- 0.06 anddexloxiglumide = 7.53 +/- 0.11). Furthermore, the selectivity of these compounds between canine CCK1 and CCK2 receptors was consistent with the selectivitybetween the human CCK1 and CCK2 receptors. 4 Two additional forms of the canine CCK1 receptor were identified during the cloning procedure. These had three (variant #1) and six (variant #2) amino-acid differences from the wild-type canine CCK1 receptor. Variant #1 bound [I-125] BH-CCK-8S and displayed an identical pharmacological profile to the wild-type receptor using the ligands described above. No significant bindingwas measured with variant #2. 5 In conclusion, we have cloned and pharmacologically characterized the canineCCK1 receptor. The data obtained will facilitate the interpretation of numerous pharmacological experiments that have been performed using canine tissue toelucidate the actions of CCK and gastrin.

Tetraponerines are a group of alkaloids occurring in the venoms of ants belonging to the genus Tetraponera. Eight compounds had been isolated and their structures elucidated, but their mechanisms of action had not yet been reported. We have studied the actions of several of these tetraponerines on vertebrate neuromuscular, ganglionic, and brain nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) using a variety of techniques including muscle contracture, cultured cell functional assays, neuronal patch clamping, and radioligand binding methods. 2. Potency for inhibition of the frog muscle carbachol-elicited contracture increased as the carbon 9 side chain alkyl group was increased in length to 10 - 12 carbons, then decreased when the chain was 18-carbons long. Potency differences between T-7 and T-8, which differ only in the stereochemistry of the carbon pentyl side chain were rather small. Quaternization of either N atom in a T-8 analog bearing a 10-carbon length alkyl substituent did not greatly affect potency for inhibition of the muscle response; thus the ionized form is an active form of this tetraponerine. 3. T-7 inhibited the nicotine-stimulated efflux of Rb-86 from cultured PC12 cells, which primarily express alpha3-beta4 ganglionic type nicotinic receptors. T-8 blockade of BTX-sensitive and insensitive neuronal nAChRs, as studied by patchclamp recordings from cultured rat brain neurons, was also consistent with a noncompetitive type of inhibition. 4. T-7 displaced binding of the nAChR ion channel binding ligand thienylcyclophenidyl (TCP), an analog of PCP, to Torpedo neuromuscular type receptors. The affinity of the TCP binding site for T-7 did not depend upon the desensitization state of the receptor. 5. We conclude that the tetraponerines act at a site on nAChRs different from the ACh binding site which is probably located within the ion channel.

Cyclosporin A (CsA), a potent immunosuppressive agent, can be nephrotoxic. Because clinical studies have suggested that the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system may be involved in the mechanism responsible for CsA nephrotoxicity, we have analysed the effects of CsA on angiotensin II (Ang II) receptors in medullary thick ascending limb (mTAL) cells known to be sensitive to the action of CsA. Methods. Experiments were carried out on subcultured mouse mTAL cells. The expression of mRNA of Ang II subtype 1 and 2 (AT(1) and AT(2)) receptors was investigated using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). [H-3]Ang II was used for radioligand and binding studies. Fluorimetric recordings using the fluorescent dye fura-2/AM were performed to determine the effect of CsA on the intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) content of untreated and Ang II-treated mTAL cells. Results. Subcultured mTAL cells expressed AT, and AT(2) Ang II receptor mRNAs, and binding studies revealed that the AT, receptors were the predominant Ang II receptor subtype (similar to90%) in mTAL cells. CsA (100 ng/ml, 24h) increased (1.7-fold) the number of Ang II receptors (untreated, 315.8; +CsA, 543.6 fmol/ mg protein) without altering the K-D (untreated, 7.16; +CsA, 7.06 nM). CsA also significantly increased the level of [Ca2+]i measured in cultured mTAL cells both in the basal state (-CSA, 72.2; +CsA, 93.4nM/10(6) cells) and in the presence of Ang II (-CSA, 97.8; +CsA, 206.3 nM/10(6) cells). Conclusions. These findings suggest that the increase in Ang II AT, receptors and [Ca2+]i caused by CsA may be involved in the mechanism(s) responsible for CsA nephrotoxicity.

The neutral "3+1" mixed-ligand complex combines 4-(6-mercaptohexyl)-1-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazine as monodentate and 3-(N-methyl)azapentane-1,5-dithiol as tridentate unit with oxotechnetium(V). The analogous rhenium complex was synthesized for complete structural characterization and used in receptor binding assays. In competition experiments both complexes display subnanomolar affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor (IC50 0.24 nm for Re, 0.13 nM for Tc) but also very high affinities for the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor (IC50 0.05 nM for Re. 0.03 nM for Tc). Biodistribution studies show a brain uptake in rat of 0.22% ID five minutes post injection. In vitro atuoradiographic studies in rat brain and postmortem human brain indicate accumulation of the Tc-99m complex in brain areas which are rich in 5-HT1A receptors or in alpha 1-adreneigic receptors. This in vitro enrichment can be blocked respectively by the 5-HT1A. receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT or by prazosin hydrochloride, an alpha 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist. Ex vivo autoradiographic studies in rats show a slight accumulation of the Tc-99m complex in 5-HT1A receptor-rich areas of the brain, which could not be blocked, as well as in regions rich in alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, which could be blocked by prazosin hydrochloride.

In common with many cytokines, it has been observed that chemokines have the potential to bind heparin-like glycosaminoglycan molecules, which are normally expressed an proteoglycan components of the cell surface and extracellular matrix. The significance of this interaction for chemokine activity remains a subject of debate. In this study, Chinese hamster ovary cells were transfected separately with the human chemokine receptors CCR1 and CCR5, and these receptors were shown to induce an intracytoplasmic Ca2+ flux and cellular chemotaxis following stimulation with the natural CC chemokine ligands (MIP-1 alpha, RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed), and MIP-1 beta). In further experiments, mutant CHO cells, with a defect in normal glycosaminoglycan (GAG) expression, were also transfected with, and shown to express similar levels of, CCR1 and CCR5. Although these receptors were functional, it was found that the mutant cells required exposure to higher concentrations of ligands than the wild-type cells in order to produce the same intracytoplasmic Ca2+ flux. Radioligand binding experiments demonstrated that specific chemokine receptors expressed by wild-type cells had a significantly greater affinity for MIP-1 alpha than similar receptors expressed by GAG-deficient mutants. However, there was no significant difference between these cells in their affinity for RANTES or MIP-1 beta. In conclusion, it has been demonstrated clearly that GAG expression is not necessary for the biological activity of the chemokines MIP-1 alpha, RANTES, or MIP-1 beta. However, the presence of cell surface GAGs does enhance the activity of low concentrations of these chemokines by a mechanism that appears to involve sequestration onto the cell surface.

Design and synthesis of the series (2-16) of new O-and S-containing ether derivatives of 1,3,5-triazines with the double-ring aromatic region have been performed. The new compounds were examined within the comprehensive pharmacological screening, including: radioligand binding assays, functional and ADMET studies in vitro as well as behavioral tests in rats. Crystallographic aspects and computer-aided structure-activity relationship were analyzed, as well. The comprehensive approach led to selection of compound 12 (4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-6-(2-(naphthalen-2-ylthio)propan-2-yl)-1,3,5-triazin-2amine) with the most significant dual 5-HT6/5-HT2AR antagonistic action (5-HT6R K-i = 11 nM, 5-HT2AR K-i = 39 nM). Moreover, the compound 12 has satisfactory ADMETox properties in vitro, i.e.: the high permeability through biological membranes, high metabolic stability, neither mutagenic nor hepatotoxic effects, and moderate ability to inhibit CYP3A4. Above all, 12 showed ability to reverse the pharmacologically-induced (MK-801) memory impairment at low doses (1-3 mg/kg) in Novel Object Recognition (NOR) test in rats. Our results indicate a promising potency of dual 5-HT6/5-HT2AR antagonism in the search for novel strategy to fight Alzheimer's disease, which remains an unmet clinical need.

Additional biomarkers are needed to confirm MSA and to advance the understanding of pathophysiology. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of the translocator protein (TSPO), expressed by glia cells, has shown elevations in MSA. Objective In this multicenter PET study, we assess the performance of TSPO imaging as a diagnostic marker for MSA. Methods We analyzed [C-11]PBR28 binding to TSPO using imaging data of 66 patients with MSA and 24 patients with PD. Group comparisons were based on regional analysis of parametric images. The diagnostic readout included visual reading of PET images against clinical diagnosis and machine learning analyses. Sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating curves were used to discriminate MSA from PD and cerebellar from parkinsonian variant MSA. Results We observed a conspicuous pattern of elevated regional [C-11]PBR28 binding to TSPO in MSA as compared with PD, with "hotspots" in the lentiform nucleus and cerebellar white matter. Visual reading discriminated MSA from PD with 100% specificity and 83% sensitivity. The machine learning approach improved sensitivity to 96%. We identified MSA subtype-specific TSPO binding patterns. Conclusions We found a pattern of significantly increased regional glial TSPO binding in patients with MSA. Intriguingly, our data are in line with severe neuroinflammation in MSA.

In this prospective study (NCT03828838), we analyzed toxicity, radiation doses, and treatment effect of Lu-177-PSMA in pateints with low-volume mHSPC. Patients and Methods: Ten progressive patients with mHSPC following local treatment, with a maximum of ten metastatic lesions on [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/diagnostic-CT imaging (PSMA-PET) and serum PSA doubling time <6 months received two cycles of Lu-177-PSMA. Whole-body single-photon emission CT/CT (SPECT/CT) and blood dosimetry was performed to calculate doses to the tumors and organs at risk (OAR). Adverse events (AE), laboratory values (monitoring response and toxicity), and quality of life were monitored until week 24 after cycle 2, the end of study (EOS). All patients underwent PSMA-PET at screening, 8 weeks after cycle 1, 12 weeks after cycle 2, and at EOS. Results: All patients received two cycles of Lu-177-PSMA without complications. No treatment-related grade III-IV adverse events were observed. According to dosimetry, none of the OAR reached threshold doses for radiation-related toxicity. Moreover, all target lesions received a higher radiation dose than the OAR. All 10 patients showed altered PSA kinetics, postponed androgen deprivation therapy, and maintained good quality of life. Half of the patients showed a PSA response of more than 50%. One patient had a complete response on PSMA-PET imaging until EOS and two others had only minimal residual disease. Conclusions: Lu-177-PSMA appeared to be a feasible and safe treatment modality in patients with low-volume mHSPC.	[Prive, Bastiaan M.; Peters, Steffie M. B.; Janssen, Marcel J.

Association of neuroinflammation with episodic memory: a [<SUP>11</SUP>C]PBR28 PET study in cognitively discordant twin pairs	BRAIN COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						mild cognitive impairment; neuroinflammation; PET imaging; Alzheimer's disease; twins	ALZHEIMER-DISEASE; TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN; MICROGLIAL ACTIVATION; RADIOLIGAND BINDING; REFERENCE REGION; IN-VIVO	Alzheimer's disease is associated with chronic response of innate immune system, referred as neuroinflammation. PET radioligands binding to the 18kDa translocator protein are potential biomarkers of neuroinflammation. Translocator protein PET studies in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease have indicated controversial results, possibly reflecting interindividual variation and heterogeneity of study populations. We controlled for genetic and environmental effects by studying twin pairs discordant for episodic memory performance. Episodic memory impairment is a well-known cognitive hallmark of early Alzheimer's disease process. Eleven same-sex twin pairs (four monozygotic pairs, six female pairs, age 72-77 years) underwent [C-11]N-acetyl-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)-2-phenoxy-5-pyridinamine ([C-11]PBR28) PET imaging, structural magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychological testing in 2014-17. Main PET outcome was the volume-weighted average standardized uptake value of cortical regions vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease pathology. Ten pairs were discordant for episodic memory performance. In the eight pairs with identical translocator protein genotype, twins with poorer episodic memory had similar to 20% higher cortical [C-11]PBR28 binding compared with their better-performing co-twins (mean intra-pair difference 0.21 standardized uptake value, 95% confidence interval 0.05-0.37, P = 0.017). The result remained the same when including all discordant pairs and controlling for translocator protein genotype. Increased translocator protein PET signal suggests that increased microglial activation is associated with poorer episodic memory performance. Twins with worse episodic memory performance compared with their co-twins had on average 20% higher uptake of the neuroinflammatory marker translocator protein PET tracer (11)[C-11]PBR28. The findings support a negative association between neuroinflammation and episodic memory and the use of translocator protein positron emission tomography as a useful indicator of Alzheimer's disease process.

Metastases were identified using Ga-68-PSMA-PET, CT, MRI and follow-up scans. Different parameters including, maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) of the healthy liver and liver metastases were assessed by two- and three-dimensional regions of interest (2D/3D ROI).ResultsOne hundred three liver metastases in 18 of 739 PC patients were identified. In total, 80 PSMA-positive (77.7%) and 23 PSMA-negative (22.3%) metastases were identified. The mean SUVmax of PSMA-positive liver metastases was significantly higher than that of the normal liver tissue in both 2D and 3D ROI (p0.05). The mean SUVmax of PSMA-positive metastases was 9.844.94 in 2D ROI and 10.27 +/- 5.28 in 3D ROI; the mean SUVmax of PSMA-negative metastases was 3.25 +/- 1.81 in 2D ROI and 3.40 +/- 1.78 in 3D ROI, and significantly lower than that of the normal liver tissue (p0.05). A significant (p0.05) correlation between SUVmax in PSMA-positive liver metastases and both size ((Spearman)=0.57) of metastases and PSA serum level ((Spearman)=0.60) was found.ConclusionsIn Ga-68-PSMA-PET, the majority of liver metastases highly overexpress PSMA and is therefore directly detectable. For the analysis of PET images, it has to be taken into account that also a significant portion of metastases can only be detected indirectly, as these metastases are PSMA-negative.

In vitro pharmacology plays a role in therapeutic drug development, drug-protein in silico interaction modeling, and drug scheduling.ObjectivesThe goal of this research was to determine mechanisms of action that may indicate NPS abuse liability.MethodsAffinities to displace the radioligand [I-125]RTI-55 and potencies to inhibit [H-3]neurotransmitter uptake for 22 cathinones, 6 benzofurans and another stimulant were characterized using human embryonic kidney cells stably expressing recombinant human transporters for dopamine, norepinephrine, or serotonin (hDAT, hNET, or hSERT, respectively). Selected compounds were tested for potencies and efficacies at inducing [H-3]neurotransmitter release via the transporters. Computational modeling was conducted to explain plausible molecular interactions established by NPS and transporters.ResultsMost -pyrrolidinophenones had high hDAT potencies and selectivities in uptake assays, with hDAT/hSERT uptake selectivity ratios of 83-360. Other substituted cathinones varied in their potencies and selectivities, with N-ethyl-hexedrone and N-ethyl-pentylone having highest hDAT potencies and N-propyl-pentedrone having highest hDAT selectivity. 4-Cl-ethcathinone and 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-propylcathinone had higher hSERT selectivity. Benzofurans generally had low hDAT selectivity, especially 1-(2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-5-yl)-N-methylpropan-2-amine, with 25-fold higher hSERT potency. Consistent with this selectivity, the benzofurans were releasers at hSERT. Modeling indicated key amino acids in the transporters' binding pockets that influence drug affinities.ConclusionsThe -pyrrolidinophenones, with high hDAT selectivity, have high abuse potential. Lower hDAT selectivity among benzofurans suggests similarity to methylenedioxymethamphetamine, entactogens with lower stimulant activity.

The aim of this study was to investigate the cerebral density of A(1)Rs in Parkinson's disease (PD) in its early stages, using PET scans with the radioligand 8-dicyclopropylmethyl-1-C-11-methyl-3-propylxanthine (C-11-MPDX). We studied 10 drug-naive patients with early PD. Each patient was also examined for dopamine transporters (DATs) and D(2)Rs by PET using C-11-2--carbomethoxy-3--(4-fluorophenyl)-tropane (C-11-CFT) and C-11-raclopride (C-11-RAC), respectively. Ten elderly, healthy volunteers were recruited as controls for C-11-MPDX PET scanning and eight elderly volunteers were recruited as controls for C-11-CFT and C-11-RAC PET scanning. The PET scans revealed a decrease in the uptake ratio index (URI) of C-11-CFT and an increase in the URI of C-11-RAC in patients. In the temporal lobe, the binding potential for C-11-MPDX was higher in the patient group than in healthy subjects, but not in the other regions examined, including the striatum. In patients, we observed motor-symptom asymmetry and a relationship between parkinsonism and the striatal density of DATs, but not A(1)R density. In the putamen of early PD, asymmetrical down-regulation of A(2A)Rs is likely a compensatory mechanism in response to a decrease in dopamine. However, our study suggests that A(1)Rs are unaltered in the putamen of early PD.

To reduce imaging measurements of defects, there is a demand for proper LC-ESI-MS/MS method to carry out with its specificity and sensitivity. This study describes a rapid and simple liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem-MS/MS (LC-ESI-MS/MS) method for determination of both PET tracers: N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide (WAY-100635) and 4-fluoro-N-[2-[4-(2-methoxylphenyl)-1-piperazino]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide (FCWAY). Both target compounds were prepared by one-step protein precipitation with acetonitrile and methanol (1:1, v/v), and analyzed using a C-18 column. This simple method has an excellent linearity, selectivity and sensitivity. Precision and accuracy values for the intra-day and inter-day validation were below 12 %. The limit of quantification (LOQ) for both target compounds was defined as 1 ng/mL in plasma and 5 ng/mL in brain homogenate. The stability of both compounds is considered stable under a various experimental conditions. The in vitro MDR-MDCK cell permeability showed the both compounds have high permeability (P-app,P- A -> B a parts per thousand yen 20 x 10(-6) cm/s) and low efflux ratio (a parts per thousand currency sign2.0). Brain to blood (AUC(brain)/AUC(blood)) distribution ratios in rats were 3.15 +/- A 0.42 for WAY-100635 and 2.20 +/- A 0.34 for FCWAY, respectively, and these results suggest that LC-ESI-MS/MS method might be a supplementary way for the identifying and understanding of radiopharmaceuticals.

We recently characterized and C-11-labeled a new VAChT inhibitor, (-)-TZ659. Here we report the in vitro and ex vivo characterization of (-)-TZ659. A stably transfected PC12(A123.7) cell line which expresses human VAChT (hVAChT) was used for the in vitro binding characterization of (-)-[H-3]TZ659. A saturated binding curve was obtained with K-d= 1.97 +/- 0.30 nM and B-max=3240 +/- 145.9 fmol/mg protein. In comparison, a PC12(A123.7) cell line that expresses mutant hVAChT showed decreased binding affinity (K-d=15.94 +/- 0.28 nM). Competitive binding assays using a panel of other CNS ligands showed no inhibition of (-)-[H-3]-TZ659 binding. On the other hand, binding inhibitions were observed only using VAChT inhibitors (K-i=0.20 - 31.35 nM). An in vitro assay using rat brain homogenates showed that (-)-[H-3]TZ659 had higher binding in striatum than in cerebellum, with a target: non target ratio > 3.46. Even higher ex vivo striatum-to-cerebellum ratios (9.56 +/- 1.11) were observed using filtered homogenates of brain tissue after rats were injected intravenously with (-)-[C-11]TZ659. Ex vivo autoradiography of (-)-[C-11]TZ659 confirmed high striatal uptake, with a consistently high striatum-to-cerebellum ratio (2.99 +/- 0.44). In conclusion, (-)-TZ659 demonstrated high potency and good specificity for VAChT in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that (-)-[C-11]TZ659 may be a promising PET tracer to image VAChT in the brain. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We investigated the cross-talk between beta-AR agonist-mediated effects on beta(2)-AR function and expression and cytokine release in human bronchial epithelial cells. In 16HBE14o(-) cells grown in the presence and absence of beta-AR agonists and/or antagonists, the beta(2)-AR density was assessed by radioligand binding; the receptor protein and mRNA was determined using laser scanning cytometer and RT-PCR; cAMP generation, the cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 release were determined using AlphaScreen Assay and ELISA, respectively. Isoprenaline (ISO) and salbutamol (Salbu) induced a concentration- and time-dependent significant decrease in beta(2)-AR density. Both Salbu and ISO reduced cAMP generation in a concentration-dependent manner while in same cell culture the IL-6 and IL-8 release was significantly enhanced. These effects were antagonized to a greater extent by ICI 118.551 than by propranolol, but CGP 20712A had no effect. Reduction of the beta(2)-AR protein and mRNA could be seen when cells were treated with ISO for 24 h. Our findings indicate a direct link between cytokine release and altered beta(2)-AR expression and function in airway epithelial cells. beta(2)-AR desensitization and downregulation induced by long-term treatment with beta(2)-AR agonists during asthma may account for adverse reactions also due to enhanced release of pro-inflammatory mediators and should, thus, be considered in asthma therapy.

Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of small molecule-based PET radioligands for the 5-hydroxytryptamine 7 receptor	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							IN-VIVO EVALUATION; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; SEROTONIN 5-HT7 RECEPTOR; 18 KDA; BRAIN; CLONING; ANTAGONIST; AFFINITY; CYCLASE; LIGAND	The 5-HT7 receptor is a recently cloned G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is important in regulating sleep, depression, and circadian rhythms. However, the potential pathophysiological roles of 5-HT7 have not been fully elucidated, and no 5-HT7 positron emission tomography (PET) radioligands are available, thus limiting imaging studies of his receptor in humans. Here, we present the radiosynthesis and biological evaluation of 5-(4-([C-11]methoxyphenyl)-1-methyl-4-nitro-1H-imidazole ([C-11]1) as a new PET ligand for 5-HT7. Three-dimensional pharmacophore evaluation and docking studies confirmed its high affinity for 5-HT7, and in vitro binding assays showed that the binding affinity was 16.8 +/- 0.9 nM. The specific activity was found to be 48 +/- 29 GBq mmol(-1) for [C-11]1 in a synthetic time of 26 +/- 3 min (n = 8), having 38 +/- 7% radiochemical yield (decay-corrected) based on [C-11]CO2. Ligand interactions with human serum albumin were studied by fluorescence quenching to obtain a Stern-Volmer plot, which showed a binding constant of 1.15 x 10(4) M-1. Whole-body biodistribution patterns were evaluated in normal mice by 1 h dynamic PET imaging; this analysis showed rapid clearance of radioactivity from the main peripheral organs, with the exception of the liver. Preliminary PET studies in rat brains showed rapid accumulation of radioactivity in the brain. The regional radioactivity reached a maximum within 0-2 min after the radioligand injection and then decreased rapidly, resulting in minimal radiation burden in the brain during the scan. In summary, this specific biaryl system has shown potential as a 5-HT7 ligand and further optimization and longitudinal studies may yield the first small molecule-based PET ligand for 5-HT7 in clinical settings.

Florbetapir F 18 Study	Radiation dosimetry of florbetapir F 18	EJNMMI RESEARCH			English	Article							INTERNAL DOSE ASSESSMENT; ALZHEIMER-DISEASE; BRAIN; PET; RADIOLIGAND; SOFTWARE; HUMANS; MODELS	Background: Florbetapir is one of several F-18-labeled amyloid plaque imaging tracers for positron emission tomography (PET). As the bio-distribution and radiation dose of PET tracers in human research are important for estimating the relative risks and benefits, a study was conducted to obtain this information on florbetapir. Methods: Nine cognitively normal subjects (six females and three males, age 58 +/- 10 years, weight 81 +/- 17 kg) received an intravenous bolus injection of 395 +/- 27.9 MBq of florbetapir, and whole-body emission scans were performed over approximately 6 h. Computed tomography scans were acquired for attenuation correction. Volumes of interest (VOIs) for source organs including the brain, liver, lung, heart wall, and vertebrae were defined on the PET images. The VOIs of the gallbladder, urinary bladder, and large and small intestines were also defined. Using reference man organ volumes (ICRP 30), total activity was calculated per organ for each time point. The resultant time-activity curves (TACs) were fitted with constrained exponentials. Kinetic data were entered into OLINDA/EXM software to calculate dose estimates; the dynamic urinary bladder and ICRP 30 GI tract models were employed. The effective dose (ED) for each subject was estimated from the acquired data using the adult model. Results: The mean ED determined for nine healthy volunteers was 18.60 +/- 4.26 mu Sv/MBq or 6.88 mSv for a 370-MBq dose. The organs that received the highest radiation absorbed doses were the gallbladder, upper large intestine, small intestine, liver, and urinary bladder at 143.0 +/- 80.20, 74.50 +/- 34.20, 65.50 +/- 29.60, 64.40 +/- 22.10, and 27.10 +/- 11.70 mu Sv/MBq, respectively. Conclusions: The ED for florbetapir has been calculated for nine healthy volunteers. At a dose of 370 MBq florbetapir, the total average ED is approximately 6.88 mSv.

Oestradiol Modulation of Serotonin Reuptake Transporter and Serotonin Metabolism in the Brain of Monkeys	JOURNAL OF NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						17-oestradiol; serotonin; serotonin reuptake transporter; ovariectomised monkey; brain	OVARIAN-STEROID REGULATION; HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY; MESSENGER-RNA EXPRESSION; AGED FEMALE RATS; DORSAL RAPHE; DOPAMINE NEUROTRANSMISSION; RHESUS MACAQUES; BINDING-SITES; BASAL GANGLIA; SERT-BINDING	Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) is an important brain neurotransmitter that is implicated in mental and neurodegenerative diseases and is modulated by ovarian hormones. Nevertheless, the effect of oestrogens on 5-HT neurotransmission in the primate caudate nucleus, putamen and nucleus accumbens, which are major components of the basal ganglia, and the anterior cerebral cortex, mainly the frontal and cingulate gyrus, is not well documented. The present study evaluated 5-HT reuptake transporter (SERT) and 5-HT metabolism in these brain regions in response to 1-month treatment with 17-oestradiol in short-term (1month) ovariectomised (OVX) monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). SERT-specific binding was measured by autoradiography using the radioligand [3H]citalopram. Biogenic amine concentrations were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography. 17-Oestradiol increased SERT in the superior frontal cortex and in the anterior cingulate cortex, in the nucleus accumbens, and in subregions of the caudate nucleus of OVX monkeys. 17-Oestradiol left [3H]citalopram-specific binding unchanged in the putamen, as well as the dorsal and medial raphe nucleus. 17-Oestradiol treatment decreased striatal concentrations of the precursor of 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptophan, and increased 5-HT, dopamine and 3-methoxytyramine concentrations in the nucleus accumbens, caudate nucleus and putamen, whereas the concentrations of the metabolites 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid remained unchanged. No effect of 17-oestradiol treatment was observed for biogenic amine concentrations in the cortical regions. A significant positive correlation was observed between [3H]citalopram-specific binding and 5-HT concentrations in the caudate nucleus, putamen and nucleus accumbens, suggesting their link. These results have translational value for women with low oestrogen, such as those in surgical menopause or perimenopause.	[Sanchez, M.

High affinity of CEP-26401 for H3R was demonstrated in radioligand binding displacement assays in rat brain membranes (K-i = 2.7 +/- 0.3 nM) and recombinant rat and human H3R-expressing systems (K-i = 7.2 +/- 0.4 and 2.0 +/- 1.0 nM, respectively). CEP-26401 displayed potent antagonist and inverse agonist activities in [S-35]guanosine 5'-O-(gamma-thio)triphosphate binding assays. After oral dosing of CEP-26401, occupancy of H3R was estimated by the inhibition of ex vivo binding in rat cortical slices (OCC50 = 0.1 +/- 0.003 mg/kg), and antagonism of the H3R agonist R-alpha-methylhistamine-induced drinking response in the rat dipsogenia model was demonstrated in a similar dose range (ED50 = 0.06 mg/kg). CEP-26401 improved performance in the rat social recognition model of short-term memory at doses of 0.01 to 0.1 mg/kg p.o. and was wake-promoting at 3 to 30 mg/kg p.o. In DBA/2NCrl mice, CEP-26401 at 10 and 30 mg/kg i.p. increased prepulse inhibition (PPI), whereas the antipsychotic risperidone was effective at 0.3 and 1 mg/kg i.p. Coadministration of CEP-26401 and risperidone at subefficacious doses (3 and 0.1 mg/kg i.p., respectively) increased PPI. These results demonstrate potent behavioral effects of CEP-26401 in rodent models and suggest that this novel H3R antagonist may have therapeutic utility in the treatment of cognitive and attentional disorders. CEP-26401 may also have therapeutic utility in treating schizophrenia or as adjunctive therapy to approved antipsychotics.

Main methods: Rats were administered nicotine (4.3 mu mol/kg) subcutaneously (sc) twice a day for 10 days. The messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of nicotinic and muscarinic receptors in the bladder was examined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and by a radioligand binding assay using [N-methyl-(3)H] scopolamine methyl chloride ([(3)H]NMS). The concentrations of nicotine and cotinine in plasma, tissues, and urine were estimated by ultra-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (UPLC/ESI-MS). Key findings: mRNA of nicotinic receptor subunits (alpha 1-alpha 7, beta 1-beta 4, epsilon) and muscarinic receptor subtypes (M(1)-M(5)) was detected in the rat bladder. There was a significant increase in the mRNA expression of alpha 3, beta 1, beta 2 and beta 4 in the nicotine-treated rats (4.3 mu mol/kg, s.c., bid.) compared to the saline-treated group. Repeated administration of nicotine significantly increased the mRNA expression of the M(2) and M(3) muscarinic receptor subtypes in the rat bladder with a significant enhancement of [(3)H]NMS binding sites, compared to the saline-treated tissue. Nicotine was distributed at higher concentrations in the bladder than the heart and cerebral cortex. Furthermore, nicotine was excreted in rat urine at high concentrations. Significance: The present study is the first to show that repeated treatment with nicotine affects pharmacologically-relevant nicotinic and muscarinic receptors in the bladder. Such changes may contribute to the etiology of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to cigarette smoking. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AZL inhibited the specific binding of I-125-Sar(1)-Ile(8)-AII to human angiotensin type 1 receptors with an IC50 of 2.6 nM. The inhibitory effect of AZL persisted after washout of the free compound (IC50 value of 7.4 nM). Olmesartan, telmisartan, valsartan, and irbesartan also inhibited the specific binding with IC50 values of 6.7, 5.1, 44.9, and 15.8 nM, respectively. However, their inhibitory effects were markedly attenuated with washout (IC50 values of 242.5, 191.6, >10,000, and >10,000 nM). AZL also inhibited the accumulation of AII-induced inositol 1-phosphate (IP1) in the cell-based assay with an IC50 value of 9.2 nmol; this effect was resistant to washout (IC50 value of 81.3 nM). Olmesartan and valsartan inhibited IP1 accumulation with IC50 values of 12.2 and 59.8 nM, respectively. The activities of these compounds were markedly reduced after washout (IC50 value of 908.5 and 22,664.4 nM). AZL was defined as an inverse agonist in an experiment by using a constitutively active mutant of human angiotensin type 1 receptors. In isolated rabbit aortic strips, AZL reduced the maximal contractile response to AII with a pD(2)' value of 9.9. The inhibitory effects of AZL on contractile responses induced by AII persisted after the strips were washed; these inhibitory effects were more potent than those of olmesartan. These results suggest that AZL is a highly potent and slowly dissociating AII receptor blocker. Its tight receptor binding might be expected to produce potent and long-lasting antihypertensive effects in preclinical and clinical settings.

Rather than acting as convulsants, several of these 'IKM' compounds markedly depressed CNS activity in mice. Here, we characterize the pharmacological profile of the series with a focus on the most potent of these molecules, IKM-159. Experimental approach: The pharmacological activity and specificity of IKM compounds were characterized using whole-cell patch clamp recording from neurons and heterologous receptor expression systems, in combination with radioligand binding techniques. Key results: The majority of the IKM compounds tested reduced excitatory synaptic transmission in neuronal cultures, and IKM-159 inhibited synaptic currents from CA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices. IKM-159 inhibited glutamate-evoked whole-cell currents from recombinant GluA2- and GluA4-containing alpha-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate (AMPA) receptors most potently, whereas kainate and NMDA receptor currents were not reduced by IKM-159. Antagonism of steady-state currents was agonist concentration dependent, suggesting that its mechanism of action was competitive, although it paradoxically did not displace [3H]-AMPA from receptor binding sites. IKM-159 reduced spontaneous action potential firing in both cultured hippocampal neurons in control conditions and during hyperactive states in an in vitro model of status epilepticus. Conclusions and implications: IKM-159 is an AMPA receptor-selective antagonist. IKM-159 and related nitrogen heterocycles represent structurally novel AMPA receptor antagonists with accessible synthetic pathways and potentially unique pharmacology, which could be of use in exploring the role of specific populations of receptors in neurophysiological and neuropathological processes.

The radiochemical yield, specific activity, and radiochemical purity of these probes was appropriate for injection. To evaluate whether the brain penetration of these probes is related to the function of two major drug efflux transporters, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), we performed PET studies using wild-type and P-gp/Bcrp knockout mice. In wild-type mice, the radioactivity level after injection with [C-11]MBF initially increased and effluxed immediately from the brain, whereas that with [C-11]JP-1302 was distributed throughout the brain. However, the regional distribution of radioactivity after injection with [C-11]JP-13-1302 in the brain was different from that of alpha(2C)-ARs. In P-gp/Bcrp knockout mice, uptake of [C-11]MBF was approximately 3.7-fold higher and that of [(11)-C]JP-1302 was approximately 1.6-fold higher than those in wild-type mice. These results indicate that brain penetration of the two PET probes was affected by modulation of P-gp and Bcrp functions.

The effect of ionising radiation on testosterone binding globulin characteristics: Correction of the protein's parameters by lipid polyene complexes of fungus <i>Laetiporus sulfureus</i>	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION BIOLOGY			English	Article						low-dose ionising radiation; testosterone binding globulin; lipid polyene complex of Laetiporus sulphureus	BYELARUS; CHILDREN; INTERFACE; LIVER; SHBG; SBP	Purpose The aims of this work were (i) To compare the effects of ionising radiation (IR) on testosterone binding globulin (TeBG) characteristics (serum concentration, cooperativity of androgen binding and affinity for hormone) in divergent mammalian species, (it) to couple radiation effects with probable TeBG-parameter changes, and (in) to investigate the prevention of these changes by fungal preparations (in particular - by lipid polyene complexes of Laeoporus sulphureus) Materials and methods Characteristics of TeBG were investigated in microaliquots of rat and human serum samples using [H-3]-5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone ([H-3]-DHT) radioligand assays after in vivo exposures to IR (external gamma-sources, incorporation of I-131-, Cs-137-radionuclides) at experimental and post-chernobyl radioecological conditions (doses 0.25-2.2 Gy) Results Species-specific changes of TeBG parameters were found depending on the type of IR, dose and time after irradiation. Specifically children living in radionuclide contaminated regions (near Chernobyl) were found to have a decrease of positive cooperativity for the TeBG-androgen binding, a drop of TeBG levels, and a decline in hormone affinity Screening of natural substances (from phanerogams and fungi) detected that lipid polyene complexes of the basidiomycete L. sulphureus allowed recovery of the standard features of TeBG. Conclusions IR induced a depletion of TeBG from blood Simultaneously with species-specific changes of TeBG, which depend on the type of radiation, the dose of radiation (from 0 25 up to 22.2 Gy), and the time after radiation The Hill coefficient of TeBG (indicating the degree of molecular cooperativity when hormone binding) appeared to be the most radiosensitive marker of the glycoprotein activity because of it is inversely to radiation dose There are pharmacological possibilities to restore IR-induced "declines" of TeBG's affinity and cooperativity for androgen ligand binding.

The quencher reduces efficiently the fluorescence of the unbound labeled ligand, whereas the fluorescence of the bound fraction is detectable. Ibis approach allows the development of homogeneous screening assays in a simple and cost-effective manner. In this study, two single-label fluorometric methods, fluorescence polarization (FP) and the QRET technique, are compared in a simple biochemical model immunoassay of estradiol. Estradiol-6-amino was labeled with fluorescein and lanthanide(III) chelates for the FP and QRET assays, respectively. The labeled estradiols were allowed to compete against free estradiol, and the assay parameters were investigated. The EC(50) value of QRET assay using europium(III)-labeled estradiol was 0.1 nM, and the assay sensitivity was approximately 10 pM. These values were more than 10-fold lower than those for the FP assay with Z values higher than 0.75 for both assays. The high sensitivity was attributed to a low concentration of antibody fragment and labeled estradiol used in the QRET assay. This reduces cost in screening studies without sacrificing the assay performance. A signal-to-background ratio (S/B) of more than 20 was reached in the QRET assay at elevated concentration of the assay components, whereas S/B of 3.6 was measured in the FP assay when both assays shared the same EC(50) value of 1 nM. Multiplexing of assays is a cost-effective means to run screening studies as multiple data can be extracted from a single experiment. Therefore, multiplexing of the QRET assay was investigated and its feasibility was successfully demonstrated in a dual-parametric assay using estradiol labeled with europium(III) and terbium(III) chelates.

Selective Interaction of Lansoprazole and Astemizole with Tau Polymers: Potential New Clinical Use in Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease	JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; benzimidazoles; neurofibrillary tangles; neuroimaging; radiotracers; surface plasmon resonance; tangles; tau aggregates	PAIRED HELICAL FILAMENTS; MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEINS; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; PHOSPHORYLATED TAU; ATROPHY RATE; BRAIN; BETA; BINDING; CORE; INTERLEUKIN-6	We describe the interactions of two benzimidazole derivatives, astemizole (AST) and lansoprazole (LNS), with anomalous aggregates of tau protein (neurofibrillary tangles). Interestingly, these compounds, with important medical applications in the treatment of allergies and gastrointestinal disorders respectively, specifically bind to aggregated variants of tau protein and to paired helical filaments isolated from brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. These ligands appear to be a powerful tool to tag brain-isolated tau-aggregates and heparin-induced polymers of recombinant tau. The interactions of AST and LNS with tau aggregates were assessed by classical radioligand assays, surface plasmon resonance, and bioinformatic approaches. The affinity of AST and LNS for tau aggregates was comparatively higher than that for amyloid-beta polymers according to our data. This is relevant since senile plaques are also abundant but are not pathognomonic in AD patients. Immunochemical studies on paired helical filaments from brains of AD patients and surface plasmon resonance studies confirm these findings. The capacity of these drugs to penetrate the blood-brain barrier was evaluated: i) in vitro by parallel artificial membrane permeability assay followed by experimental Log P determinations; and ii) in vivo by pharmacokinetic studies comparing distribution profiles in blood and brain of mice using HPLC/UV. Importantly, our studies indicate that the brain/blood concentration ratios for these compounds were suitable for their use as PET radiotracers. Since neurofibrillary tangles are positively correlated with cognitive impairment, we concluded that LNS and AST have a great potential in PET neuroimaing for in vivo early detection of AD and in reducing the formation of neurofibrillary tangles.

Assays were performed using two different incubation buffers: glycylglycine or Tris-HCl. Changes in the [S-35]GTP gamma S basal binding values were detected, and different [S-35]GTP gamma S specific binding values were also obtained depending on the buffer used for each drug. The best results were obtained with epinephrine in Tris-HCl, with slightly higher stimulation values than the observed with UK 14304 in glycylglycine buffer. The effect of the addition of adenosine deaminase to the incubation buffer was also tested. This effect decreasing basal binding in chicken was very small when compared to mammals, according with differences found in adenosine 1 receptor expression levels. Structures presenting alpha(2)-adrenoceptor-mediated G(i/o) protein stimulation fitted with areas previously described as enriched in alpha(2)-adrenoceptors in chicken brain, and their homologous areas in mammals. These data confirm the specificity of the results and reinforce the implication of the alpha(2)-adrenoceptors in the function of these brain nuclei. On the other hand, the expression level of the different alpha(2)-adrenoceptor subtypes was tested with real-time PCR. Contrasting with the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor subtype distribution previously described with radioligand competition assays, where alpha(2A) was the predominant alpha(2)-adrenoceptor subtype (>= 75%); in the present work, the ratio Of alpha(2A):alpha(2B/C) gene expression was lower than expected both in telencephalon, tectum opticum, and cerebellum.

Ticagrelor binds to human P2Y<sub>12</sub> independently from ADP but antagonizes ADP-induced receptor signaling and platelet aggregation	JOURNAL OF THROMBOSIS AND HAEMOSTASIS			English	Article						2MeS-ADP; ADP; AZ11931285; AZD6140; P2Y(12); platelet aggregation; ticagrelor	ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME; ALLOSTERIC MODULATION; ACTIVE METABOLITE; AZD6140; CLOPIDOGREL; INHIBITION; AGONISTS; SAFETY	Background: P2Y(12) plays an important role in regulating platelet aggregation and function. This receptor is the primary target of thienopyridine antiplatelet agents, the active metabolites of which bind irreversibly to the receptor, and of newer agents that can directly and reversibly modulate receptor activity. Objective: To characterize the receptor biology of the first reversibly binding oral P2Y(12) antagonist, ticagrelor (AZD6140), a member of the new cyclopentyltriazolopyrimidine (CPTP) class currently in phase III development. Methods: Ticagrelor displayed apparent non-competitive or insurmountable antagonism of ADP-induced aggregation in human washed platelets. This was investigated using competition binding against [H-3]ADP, [P-33]2MeS-ADP and the investigational CPTP compound [I-125]AZ11931285 at recombinant human P2Y(12). Functional receptor inhibition studies were performed using a GTP gamma S-binding assay, and further binding studies were performed using membranes prepared from washed human platelets. Results: Radioligand-binding studies demonstrated that ticagrelor binds potently and reversibly to human P2Y(12) with K-on and K-off of (1.1 +/- 0.2) x 10(-4) nm(-1) s(-1) and (8.7 +/- 1.4) x 10(-4) s(-1), respectively. Ticagrelor does not displace [H-3]ADP from the receptor (K-i > 10 mu m) but binds competitively with [P-33]2MeS-ADP (K-i = 4.3 +/- 1.3 nm) and [I-125]AZ11931285 (K-i = 0.33 +/- 0.04 nm), and shows apparent non-competitive inhibition of ADP-induced signaling but competitive inhibition of 2MeS-ADP-induced signaling. Binding studies on membranes prepared from human washed platelets demonstrated similar non-competitive binding for ADP and ticagrelor. Conclusions: These data indicate that P2Y(12) is targeted by ticagrelor via a mechanism that is non-competitive with ADP, suggesting the existence of an independent receptor-binding site for CPTPs.

Inhibition of inducible NO synthase was competitive with L-arginine, pointing to an interaction of BYK191023 with the catalytic center of the enzyme. In radioligand and surface plasmon resonance experiments, BYK191023 exhibited an affinity for iNOS, nNOS, and eNOS of 450 nM, 30 mu M, and > 500 mu M, respectively. Inhibition of cellular nitrate/nitrite synthesis in RAW, rat mesangium, and human embryonic kidney 293 cells after iNOS induction showed 40- to 100-fold higher IC50 values than at the isolated enzyme, in agreement with the much higher L-arginine concentrations in cell culture media and inside intact cells. BYK191023 did not show any toxicity in various rodent and human cell lines up to high micromolar concentrations. The inhibitory potency of BYK191023 was tested in isolated organ models of iNOS (lipopolysaccharidetreated and phenylephrine-precontracted rat aorta; IC50 = 7 mu M), eNOS (arecaidine propargyl esterinduced relaxation of phenylephrine-precontracted rat aorta; IC50 > 100 mu M), and nNOS (field-stimulated relaxation of phenylephrine-precontracted rabbit corpus cavernosum; IC50 > 100 mu M). These data confirm the high selectivity of BYK191023 for iNOS over eNOS and nNOS found at isolated enzymes. In summary, we have identified a new highly selective iNOS inhibitor structurally unrelated to known compounds and L-arginine. BYK191023 is a valuable tool for the investigation of iNOS-mediated effects in vitro and in vivo.

In radioligand-binding studies Ro 115-1240 had greater affinity for alpha(1A) than for alpha(1B) and alpha(1D) subtypes. The potency and intrinsic activity of amidephrine and Ro 115-1240 relative to noradrenaline were determined in native and cell-based assays using human recombinant alpha(1)-ARs; they acted as selective alpha(1A/1L)-AR full and partial agonists, respectively. In anaesthetized micropigs and rabbits, amidephrine and Ro 115-1240 produced non-selective, dose-dependent increases in intraurethral and arterial blood pressures but the magnitude of the pressure increases evoked by Ro 115-1240 were about a third of those with amidephrine. In conscious micropigs both agents produced dose-dependent increases in urethral tension. Again, the magnitude of the urethral response to Ro 115-1240 was about a third of that with amidephrine. More importantly, only amidephrine produced dose-dependent increases in blood pressure and decreases in heart rate. Ro 115-1240 produced a maximum increase in urethral tension with no effect on blood pressure or heart rate. These results show that by combining selectivity for the alpha(1A/1L)-AR subtype with a reduction in intrinsic agonist efficacy, Ro 115-1240 has reduced haemodynamic effects while retaining to some degree the contractile effects on urethral smooth muscle. These studies indicate that Ro 115-1240 may be useful as a novel treatment for SUI.

Synthesis of analogues substituted in positions 0, 1, 3, 4 and 10	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						nociceptin analogues; peptide synthesis; binding assay; MVD biossay	DYNORPHIN-A ANALOGS; ORPHANIN-FQ; RECEPTOR; NEUROPEPTIDE; SELECTIVITY; NOCICEPTIN; BINDING	A series of analogues of nociceptin, Noc(1-13)NH2 (an agonist at the ORL1 receptor) was synthesized with following modifications: (1) N-terminal extension with Arg(0); (2) replacement of Gly(3) by basic or polar amino acids-Arg, Asn, Lys(For) or deletion; (3) exchange of Phe(1) or Phe(4) by Phe(NO2); (4) substitution of Ser(10) with D-Ser, Pro, D-Pro. The analogs were synthesized by solid-phase methodology using Fmoc-amino acid pentafluorophenyl esters. The affinity for the ORL1 and for the kappa, mu and delta-opioid receptors was investigated by radioligand binding assay and bioactivity by a mouse vas deferens (MVD) assay. The addition of the amino acid residue Arg to the N-terminal enhances the opioid receptor affinity of Noc(1-13)NH2 while retaining ORL1 receptor affinity at a moderate level. The replacement of Gly in position 3 by the basic or polar amino acids-Arg, Asn, Lys(For) or its deletion led to inactive analogues. The replacement of Ser in position 10 by its D-isomer, Pro and D-Pro resulted in a series of analogues with the following order of activity: Ser(10) > D-Ser(10) > Pro(10) > D-Pro(10). In [D-Ser(10)]Noc(1-13)NH2, introduction of an additional Phe(NO2)(4) led to a > 60-fold increase of ORL1 affinity, completely attenuating the loss of affinity brought about by Ser(10). In other analogues, introduction of Phe(NO2)(4) did not change the magnitude of ORL1 binding significantly. Generally, while modifications in position 3 frequently led to a loss of most or all bioactivity, modifications in position 0 (Arg(0)) or 4 (Phe(NO2)(4)) and 10 (D-Ser(10), Pro(10)) are tolerated.

Thus, we compared 2 groups of ovariectomized-estradiol-treated ewes that expressed high vs low LH pulsatility in two different paradigms ( 2 groups per paradigm): ( a) refractoriness ( low LH secretion) or not ( high LH secretion) to short days in pineal-intact Ile-de-France ewes (RSD) and ( b) endogenous circannual rhythm ( ECR) in free-running pinealectomized Suffolk ewes in the active or inactive stage of their reproductive rhythm. Results: In RSD ewes, density of 5HT2A receptor mRNA ( by in situ hybridization) was significantly higher in the high LH group ( 25.3 +/- 1.4 vs 21.4 +/- 1.5 grains/neuron, P < 0.05) and H-3-Ketanserin binding ( a specific radioligand) of the median part of the premammillary hypothalamus tended to be higher in the high group ( 29.1 +/- 4.0 vs 24.6 +/- 4.2 fmol/mg tissu-equivalent; P < 0.10). In ECR ewes, density of 5HT2A receptor mRNA and H-3-Ketanserin binding were both significantly higher in the high LH group (20.8 +/- 1.6 vs 17.0 +/- 1.5 grains/neuron, P < 0.01, and 19.7 +/- 5.0 vs 7.4 +/- 3.4 fmol/ mg tissu-equivalent; P < 0.05, respectively). Conclusions: We conclude that these higher 5HT2A receptor gene expression and binding activity of 5HT2A receptor in the premammillary hypothalamus are associated with stimulation of LH pulsatility expressed before the development of refractoriness to short days and prior to the decline of reproductive neuroendocrine activity during expression of the endogenous circannual rhythm.

Each of the dimers potently stimulated Ca-45(2+) release from permeabilized cells expressing predominantly type 1 (SH-SY5Y cells) or type 2 (hepatocytes) IP3 receptors. The shortest dimers, with PEG linkers of an effective length of 1.5 nm or less, were the most potent, being 3-4-fold more potent than IP3. In radioligand binding experiments using cerebellar membranes, the shortest dimers bound with highest affinity, although the longest dimer (8 nm) also bound with almost 4-fold greater affinity than IP3. The affinity of monomeric IP3 with only the PEG attached was 2-fold weaker than IP3, confirming that the increased affinity of the dimers requires the presence of both IP3 motifs. The increased affinity of the long dimer probably results from the linked IP3 molecules binding to sites on different receptors, because the dimer bound with greater affinity than IP3 to cerebellar membranes, where receptors are densely packed, but with the same affinity as IP3 to purified receptors. IP3 and the IP3 dimers, irrespective of their length, bound with similar affinity to a monomeric IP3-binding domain of the type 1 IP3 receptor expressed in bacteria. Short dimers therefore bind with increased affinity only when the receptor is tetrameric. We conclude that the four IP3-binding sites of an IP3 receptor may be separated by as little as 1.5 nm and are therefore likely to be placed centrally in this large (25 x 25 nm) structure, consistent with previous work indicating a close association between the central pore and the IP3-binding sites of the IP3 receptor.

The identity of the exact receptor type mediating the growth promoting effects: of gastrin in tumours is uncertain. However, the best-characterised gastrin receptor is the CCK receptor type B (CCKB)/gastrin receptor. The anti-GRE1 antibody is a polyclonal, affinity-purified antibody raised against GRE1, a synthetic 21 amino acid peptide homologous to part of the extracellular, N-terminal tail of the CCKB receptor. We have recently proven that GRE1 antiserum specifically localises CCKB receptors on CCKB receptor transfected NIH3T3 cells and human gastrointestinal tumour cells by Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. GRE1 antiserum also inhibits liver invasion in the C170HM(2) colorectal liver-metastasis model. Aim: To relate the ability of GRE1 antiserum to displace G17 from CCKB receptors with its: impact on cellular transduction effects. Methods: Radioligand binding studies were performed with (125)IG17 and Calcium mobilisation studies by use of the fluorescent dye Fura 2-am. Results: GRE1 antiserum competitively displaced 50% radiolabelled gastrin-17 from whole cell NIH3T3 CCKB transfectants at a protein concentration of 250 mug ml(-1). GRE1 antiserum did not stimulate calcium ion influx in the transfectant N1H3T3 cells when used at a range of protein concentrations. Pre-incubation with GRE1 antiserum was required to inhibit gastrin-stimulated calcium ion influx. This was found to be concentration-dependent, with inhibition shown at 30 and 5 mug ml(-1) but not at 500 ng ml(-1) or below. Conclusion: The GRE1 antiserum is specific for the CCKB receptor and may act to inhibit gastrin-stimulated signalling in tumour cells. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The affinity of various ifenprodil site ligands-eliprodil, (R*,R*)-4-hydroxy-alpha-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-beta -methyl-4-phenyl-1-piperidineethanol [(+/-)-CP-101,606], cis-3-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-hydroxy-1- piperidinyl]-3,4-dihydro-2H-1-benzopyran-4,7-diol [(+/-)-CP-283,097], and (R*,S*)-alpha-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-beta -methyl-4-(phenylmethyl)-1-piperidinepropanol [(+/-)-Ro 25-6981] was very similar for inhibition of [H-3]ifenprodil binding to recombinant human NR1a/NR2B and native rat receptors, whereas allosteric inhibition of [H-3]ifenprodil binding by polyamine site ligands (spermine, spermidine, and arcaine) showed approximately twofold lower affinity for recombinant receptors compared with native receptors. Glutamate site ligands were less effective at modulating [H-3]ifenprodil binding to recombinant NR1a/NR2B receptors compared with native rat receptors, The NMDA receptor-specific [H-3]ifenprodil binding conditions described were also applied to ex vivo experiments to determine the receptor occupancy of ifenprodil site ligands [ifenprodil, (+/-)-CP-101,606, (+/-)-CP-283,097, and (+/-)Ro 25-6981] given systemically.

In this receptor class, the agonist binding site is formed by parts of the extracellular amino-terminal region. This study examines the effects of altering phenylalanine 107 (F107) of the 5-HT3AL subunit, obtained from NG108-15 cells, using site-directed mutagenesis. The wild-type (WT) and mutant receptors were expressed in HEK 293 cells and characterized using both whole-cell patch-clamp and radioligand binding. The tyrosine mutant F107Y exhibits a significantly lower affinity for the agonist 5-HT (K-i = 203 versus 15.6 nM) and an increase of similar magnitude in the EC50 value (10.6 versus 1.2 mu M) compared with WT. The activation kinetics of the maximal currents generated by 5-HT with this mutant were markedly slower than those of the WT receptor, but application of supramaximal concentrations of the agonist markedly decreased the time to half-peak. The asparagine mutant F107N displayed a significantly higher affinity for 5-HT than the WT receptor (1.62 versus 15.6 nM), which was mirrored in direction and magnitude by changes in the EC50 value for this agonist (0.2 versus 1.2 mu M). In contrast to the WT receptor, the mutant F107N was activated by acetylcholine (EC50 = 260 mu M). The response to acetylcholine was blocked by the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist renzapride with a similar IC50 value as that determined against currents generated by 5-HT in the WT receptor. These data suggest that F107 is an important determinant of agonist recognition at the 5-HT3 receptor.

Our studies revealed a significant decrease in the densities of 5-HT1 and 5-HT1A receptor sites in cortex and hippocampus of rat brain after chronic administration of fluoxetine (10 mg/Kg body wt.). However there was no significant change in the affinity of [H-3]5-HT and [H-3]DPAT for 5-HT1 and 5-HT1A receptor sites, respectively. However, in striatum, along with a significant (75%) downregulation of 5-HT1 sites, the affinity of [H-3]5-HT to these sites was increased, as revealed by decrease in Kd (0.50 +/- 0.08 nM). Displacement studies showed that fluoxetine has higher affinity for 5-HT1A receptors with a Ki value of 14.0 +/- 2.8 nM, than 5-HT1 sites. No significant change was observed in basal AC activity in any region after fluoxetine exposure. However, in cortex of experimental. rats the 5-HT stimulated AC activity was significantly increased (16.03 +/- 0.97 pmoles/mg protein; p < 0.01), when compared to 5-HT stimulated AC activity (12.98 +/- 0.78 pmoles/mg protein) in control rats. The increase in 5-HT stimulated AC activity in cortex may be due to the significant downregulation of 5-HT1A sites in cortex after fluoxetine exposure as these sites are negatively coupled to AC. The observed significant decrease in 5-HT1 sites with concomitant increase in 5-HT stimulated AC activity, after fluoxetine treatment, suggests that fluoxetine, which has high affinity for these sites, acts by modulating the 5-HT1A receptor mediated response in brain.

The DOTA-conjugate PSMA-617 has proven high potential in PSMA radioligand therapy (PSMA-RLT) of prostate cancer as well as PET imaging when labeled with lutetium-177 and gallium-68 respectively. Considering the relatively short physical half-life of gallium-68 this positron emitter precludes prolonged acquisition periods, as required for pre-therapeutic dosimetry or intraoperative applications. In this context, the positron emitter scandium-44 is an attractive alternative for PET imaging. We report the synthesis of [Sc-44]Sc-PSMA-617 as radiopharmaceutical with generator produced scandium-44, its in vitro characterization and clinical translation as part of a first in-human study. Methods: Scandium-44 was obtained from a Ti-44/Sc-44 radionuclide generator. PSMA-617 was labeled with 142.4 +/- 12.7 MBq of scandium-44 in analogy to [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-617 and evaluated in vitro and in cell studies using PSMA+ LNCaP cells. A first-in-human investigation was subsequently carried out in a cohort of 4 patients (mean age 70 +/- 1.8 a) registered for [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 therapy. 50.5 +/- 9.3 MBq (40 mu g, 38.4 nmol) [Sc-44]Sc-PSMA-617 were applied via intravenous injection (i. v.), respectively. A Siemens Biograph 2 PET/CT system was used to acquire initial dynamic PET data (30 min) of abdomen in list mode followed by static PET/CT data (skull to mid-thigh) at 45 min, 2 and 18 h post-injection (p.i.). For quantitative analysis, dynamic images were reconstructed as 6 data sets of 300 s each. The noise ratio was measured in liver, lung and an additional region outside the body. SUV values in different organs and lesions were measured and compared to [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 data of the same patients. Residence times and organ absorbed doses were calculated using OLINDA/EXM software. Results: Quantitative radiochemical yields of >= 98 % were achieved using 18 nmol of PSMA-617 after 20 min at 95 degrees C with apparent molar activity of 6.69 +/- 0.78 MBq/nmol. Following purification, > 99 % radiochemical purity was obtained. [Sc-44]Sc-PSMA-617 showed high stability (> 95 %) in serum for 24 h. The binding affinity and internalization fraction were determined in PSMA+ LNCaP cells (IC50 = 4.72 +/- 0.7 nM and internalization fraction: 15.78 +/- 2.14 % IA/10(6) LNCaP cells) and compared to [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 (12.0 +/- 2.8 nM and 9.47 +/- 2.56 % IA/10(6) LNCaP cells). Physiological tracer uptake was observed in kidneys, liver, spleen, small intestine, urinary bladder, and salivary glands and pathological uptake in both soft and skeletal metastases. SUV values were significantly lower in the kidneys (14.0) compared to [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 OET (30.5). All other measured SUV values did not show a statistically significant difference. Tumor to liver ratios were found to lie between 1.9 and 8.3 for [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 and between 2.5 and 8.8 for [Sc-44]Sc-PSMA-617 after 120 min. For [Sc-44]Sc-PSMA-617 the ratios were higher and no statistically significant differences were observed. Total and % activity were highest in liver followed by kidneys, spleen, small intestine and salivary glands. Rapid wash out was seen in liver and spleen and gradually over time in kidneys. Kidneys received the highest radiation absorbed dose of 0.354 (0.180-0.488) mSv/MBq. No adverse pharmacological effects were observed. Conclusion: In conclusion [Sc-44]Sc-PSMA-617 PET is suitable for PET imaging of prostate cancer tissue. [Sc-44]Sc-PSMA-617 shows promise to enable pre-therapeutic dosimetry in clinical settings. However, the clinical advantages for individual dosimetry or other applications like intraoperative applications have to be investigated in further studies.

The introduction of an albumin binding moiety (ABM), such as 4-(4-iodophenyl)-butyric acid (IPBA), that has high affinity with the blood albumin and prolongs the circulation half-life can improve the pharmacokinetics of drugs. To perform more effective targeted alpha therapy (TAT), we designed and synthesized Ga-DOTA-K([At-211]APBA)-c(RGDfK) ([At-211]5) with 4-(4-astatophenyl)-butyric acid (APBA), which has an astato group instead of an iodo group in IPBA. We evaluated whether APBA functions as ABM and [At-211]5 is effective for TAT. In addition, we prepared Ga-labeled RGD peptide without ABM, [Ga]Ga-DOTA-K-c(RGDfK) ([Ga]3), and I-12-labeled RGD peptide with ABM, Ga-DOTA-K([I-12]IPBA)-c(RGDfK) ([I-12]4), to compare with [At-211]5.Methods Biodistribution experiments of [Ga]3 without ABM, [I-12]4 and [At-211]5 with ABM were conducted in normal mice and U-87 MG tumor-bearing mice. In addition, two doses of [At-211]5 (370 or 925 kBq) were administered to U-87 MG tumor-bearing mice to confirm the therapeutic effects.Results The blood retention of [I-12]4 and [At-211]5 was remarkably increased compared to [Ga]3. Also, [I-12]4 and [At-211]5 showed similar biodistribution and significantly greater tumor accumulation and retention compared to [Ga]3. In addition, [At-211]5 inhibited tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner.Conclusion The functionality of APBA as ABM like IPBA, and the usefulness of [At-211]5 as the radionuclide therapy agent for TAT was revealed.

The cannabinoid type 2 receptor (CB2R) is an emerging target for neuroinflammation and therapeutics of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we aim to assess the alterations in brain CB2R levels and evaluate novel CB2R imaging tracers in the arcAss mouse model of Alzheimer's disease amyloidosis. Immunohistochemical staining for amyloid-ss deposits (6E10), microgliosis (anti-Iba1 and anti-CD68 antibodies), astrocytes (GFAP) and the anti-CB2R antibody was performed on brain slices from 17-month-old arcAss mice. Autoradiography using the CB2R imaging probes [F-18]RoSMA-18-d6, [C-11]RSR-056, and [C-11]RS-028 and mRNA analysis were performed in brain tissue from arcAss and non-transgenic littermate (NTL) mice at 6, 17, and 24 months of age. Specific increased CB2R immunofluorescence intensities on the increased number of GFAP-positive astrocytes and Iba1-positive microglia were detected in the hippocampus and cortex of 17-month-old arcAss mice compared to NTL mice. CB2R immunofluorescence was higher in glial cells inside 6E10-positive amyloid-ss deposits than peri-plaque glial cells, which showed low background immunofluorescence in the hippocampus and cortex of 17-month-old arcAss mice. Ex vivo autoradiography showed that the specific binding of [F-18]RoSMA-18-d6 and [C-11]RSR-056 was comparable in arcAss and NTL mice at 6, 17, and 24 months of age. The level of Cnr2 mRNA expression in the brain was not significantly different between arcAss and NTL mice at 6, 17, or 24 months of age. In conclusion, we demonstrated pronounced specific increases in microglial and astroglial CB2R expression levels in a mouse model of AD-related cerebral amyloidosis, emphasizing CB2R as a suitable target for imaging neuroinflammation.

Pharmacological evaluation and forensic case series of <i>N</i>-pyrrolidino etonitazene (etonitazepyne), a newly emerging 2-benzylbenzimidazole 'nitazene' synthetic opioid	ARCHIVES OF TOXICOLOGY			English	Article						New synthetic opioids (NSOs); 2-benzylbenzimidazole 'nitazene' opioids; Forensic toxicology; mu-opioid receptor; In vitro and in vivo characterization; New psychoactive substances (NPS)	UND VERWANDTE HETEROCYCLEN; MORPHINE; SYSTEM	Novel synthetic opioids continue to emerge on recreational drug markets worldwide. In response to legislative bans on fentanyl analogues, non-fentanyl structural templates, such as 2-benzylbenzimidazoles ('nitazenes' ), are being exploited to create new mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonists. Here, we pharmacologically characterize an emerging cyclic analogue of etonitazene, called N-pyrrolidino etonitazene (etonitazepyne), using in vitro and in vivo methods. A series of analytically confirmed fatalities is described to complement preclinical findings. Radioligand binding assays in rat brain tissue revealed that N-pyrrolidino etonitazene has high affinity for MOR (Ki = 4.09 nM) over delta-opioid (Ki = 959 nM) and kappa-opioid (Ki = 980 nM) receptors. In a MOR-beta-arrestin2 activation assay, N-pyrrolidino etonitazene displayed high potency (EC50 = 0.348 nM), similar to etonitazene (EC50 = 0.360 nM), and largely exceeding the potencies of fentanyl (EC50 = 14.9 nM) and morphine (EC50 = 290 nM). When administered s.c. to male Sprague Dawley rats, N-pyrrolidino etonitazene induced opioid-like antino-ciceptive, cataleptic, and thermic effects. Its potency in the hot plate test (ED50 = 0.0017 mg/kg) was tenfold and 2,000-fold greater than fentanyl (ED50 = 0.0209 mg/kg) and morphine (ED50 =3.940 mg/kg), respectively. Twenty-one overdose fatalities associated with N-pyrrolidino etonitazene were found to contain low blood concentrations of the drug (median = 2.2 ng/mL), commonly in the context of polysubstance use. N-Pyrrolidino etonitazene was reported as a cause of death in at least two cases, demonstrating toxicity in humans. We demonstrate that N-pyrrolidino etonitazene is an extremely potent MOR agonist that is likely to present high risk to users. Continued vigilance is required to identify and characterize emergent 2-benzylbenzimidazoles, and other non-fentanyl opioids, as they appear in the marketplace.

We tested whether exercise training (ET), as recommended by current guidelines, had the potential to stabilize RyR2-dependent Ca2+ release in rats with post-myocardial infarction HF. Materials and Methods: We subjected male Wistar rats to left coronary artery ligation or sham operations. After 1 week, animals were characterized by echocardiography and randomized to high-intensity interval ET on treadmills or to sedentary behavior (SED). Running speed was adjusted based on a weekly VO2max test. We repeated echocardiography after 5 weeks of ET and harvested left ventricular cardiomyocytes for analysis of RyR2-dependent systolic and spontaneous Ca2+ release. Phosphoproteins were analyzed by Western blotting, and beta-adrenoceptor density was quantified by radioligand binding. Results: ET increased VO2max in HF-ET rats to 127% of HF-SED (P < 0.05). This coincided with attenuated spontaneous SR Ca2+ release in left ventricular cardiomyocytes from HF-ET but also reduced Ca2+ transient amplitude and slowed Ca2+ reuptake during adrenoceptor activation. However, ventricular diameter and fractional shortening were unaffected by ET. Analysis of Ca2+ homeostasis and major proteins involved in the regulation of SR Ca2+ release and reuptake could not explain the attenuated spontaneous SR Ca2+ release or reduced Ca2+ transient amplitude. Importantly, measurements of beta-adrenoceptors showed a normalization of beta(1)-adrenoceptor density and beta(1):beta(2)-adrenoceptor ratio in HF-ET. Conclusion: ET increased aerobic capacity in post-myocardial infarction HF rats and stabilized RyR2-dependent Ca2+ release. Our data show that these effects of ET can be gained without major alterations in SR Ca2+ regulatory proteins and indicate that future studies should include upstream parts of the sympathetic signaling pathway.

PDE10A hydrolyzes both cyclic adenosine monophosphate and cyclic guanosine monophosphate and modulates dopamine signaling downstream of receptor activation in both direct and indirect pathways of the striatum. TAK-063 exhibited antipsychotic-like effects in animal models; however, the translatability of these models to the clinical manifestations of schizophrenia and the meaningfulness for new targets such as PDE10A has not been established. Methods: The TAK-063 phase 1 program included a comprehensive translational development strategy with the main objective of determining whether the antipsychotic-like pharmacodynamic effects seen in nonclinical models would translate to human subjects. To evaluate this objective, we conducted a single-rising dose study (84 healthy subjects), a positron emission tomography (PET) study (12 healthy subjects), a functional magnetic resonance imaging blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) study (27 healthy subjects), and a multiple-rising dose study that included people with schizophrenia (30 healthy Japanese subjects and 47 subjects with stable schizophrenia). In addition, assessments of cognition and electroencephalography (27 healthy subjects and 47 subjects with stable schizophrenia) were included. Results: PDE10A engagement by TAK-063 was verified with a novel PET radiotracer for use in primates and humans. TAK-063 showed favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles in humans, and TAK-063 reduced ketamine-induced changes in electroencephalography and BOLD signaling in animal models and healthy human subjects. In addition, analogous effects on cognition were observed in animal models and human subjects. Conclusions: Overall, the phase 1 results showed some consistent evidence of antipsychotic activity. This translational strategy may be valuable for the future development of novel therapeutic approaches, even when relevant nonclinical models are not available.

Synaptic Loss in Primary Tauopathies Revealed by [<SUP>11</SUP>C]UCB-JPositron Emission Tomography	MOVEMENT DISORDERS			English	Article						[C-11]UCB-J PET; PSP; CBS; synaptic vesicle protein 2A; tauopathy	PROGRESSIVE SUPRANUCLEAR PALSY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; PATHOLOGICAL TAU; AMYLOID-BETA; DEGENERATION; DIAGNOSIS; CRITERIA; PET; OLIGOMERS; NETWORK	Background Synaptic loss is a prominent and early feature of many neurodegenerative diseases. Objectives We tested the hypothesis that synaptic density is reduced in the primary tauopathies of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) (Richardson's syndrome) and amyloid-negative corticobasal syndrome (CBS). Methods Forty-four participants (15 CBS, 14 PSP, and 15 age-/sex-/education-matched controls) underwent PET with the radioligand [C-11]UCB-J, which binds to synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A, a marker of synaptic density; participants also had 3 Tesla MRI and clinical and neuropsychological assessment. Results Nine CBS patients had negative amyloid biomarkers determined by [C-11]PiB PET and hence were deemed likely to have corticobasal degeneration (CBD). Patients with PSP-Richardson's syndrome and amyloid-negative CBS were impaired in executive, memory, and visuospatial tasks. [C-11]UCB-J binding was reduced across frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes, cingulate, hippocampus, insula, amygdala, and subcortical structures in both PSP and CBD patients compared to controls (P< 0.01), with median reductions up to 50%, consistent with postmortem data. Reductions of 20% to 30% were widespread even in areas of the brain with minimal atrophy. There was a negative correlation between global [C-11]UCB-J binding and the PSP and CBD rating scales (R = -0.61,P< 0.002; R = -0.72,P< 0.001, respectively) and a positive correlation with the revised Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (R = 0.52;P= 0.01). Conclusions We confirm severe synaptic loss in PSP and CBD in proportion to disease severity, providing critical insight into the pathophysiology of primary degenerative tauopathies. [C-11]UCB-J may facilitate treatment strategies for disease-modification, synaptic maintenance, or restoration.

To clarify whether these abnormalities are specific to the epileptogenic zone (EZ), we characterized in vivo whole-brain mGluR5 availability in MTLE patients using positron emission tomography (PET) and [C-11]ABP688, a radioligand that binds specifically to the mGluR5 allosteric site. Methods Thirty-one unilateral MTLE patients and 30 healthy controls underwent [C-11]ABP688 PET. We compared partial volume corrected [C-11]ABP688 nondisplaceable binding potentials (BPND) between groups using region-of-interest and whole-brain voxelwise analyses. [F-18]Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET was acquired in 15 patients, for whom we calculated asymmetry indices of [C-11]ABP688 BPND and [F-18]FDG uptake to compare lateralization and localization differences. Results [C-11]ABP688 BPND was focally reduced in the epileptogenic hippocampal head and amygdala (p < 0.001). Patients with hippocampal atrophy showed more extensive abnormalities, including the ipsilateral temporal neocortex (p = 0.006). [C-11]ABP688 BPND showed interhemispheric differences of higher magnitude and discriminated the epileptogenic structures more accurately when compared to [F-18]FDG uptake, which showed more widespread hypometabolism. Among 23 of 25 operated patients with >1 year of follow-up, 13 were seizure-free (Engel Ia) and showed significantly lower [C-11]ABP688 BPND in the ipsilateral entorhinal cortex. Interpretation [C-11]ABP688 PET provides a focal biomarker for the EZ in MTLE with higher spatial accuracy compared to [F-18]FDG PET. Focally reduced mGluR5 availability in the EZ might reflect receptor internalization or conformational changes in response to excessive extracellular glutamate, supporting a potential role for mGluR5 as therapeutic target in human MTLE.

Leveraging Bioorthogonal Click Chemistry to Improve <SUP>225</SUP>Ac-Radioimmunotherapy of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma	CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH			English	Article							TARGETED ALPHA-THERAPY; DOSIMETRY ESTIMATE; CLINICAL UTILITY; RADIOIMMUNOTHERAPY; EMITTERS; CANCER; PET; RADIOCHEMISTRY; CA-19-9; CA19.9	Purpose: Interest in targeted alpha-therapy has surged due to -particles' high cytotoxicity. However, the widespread clinical use of this approach could be limited by on-/off-target toxicities. Here, we investigated the inverse electron-demand Diels-Alder ligation between an Ac-225-labeled tetrazine radioligand and a trans-cyclooctene-bearing anti-CA19.9 antibody (5B1) for pretargeted alpha-radioimmunotherapy (PRIT) of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This alternative strategy is expected to reduce nonspecific toxicities as compared with conventional radioimmunotherapy (RIT). Experimental Design: A side-by-side comparison of Ac-225-PRIT and conventional RIT using a directly Ac-225-radiolabeled immunoconjugate evaluates the therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of both methodologies in PDAC murine models. Results: A comparative biodistribution study of the PRIT versus RIT methodology underscored the improved pharmacokinetic properties (e.g., prolonged tumor uptake and increased tumor-to-tissue ratios) of the PRIT approach. Cerenkov imaging coupled to PRIT confirmed the in vivo biodistribution of Ac-225-radioimmunoconjugate but-importantly-further allowed for the ex vivo monitoring of Ac-225's radioactive daughters' redistribution. Human dosimetry was extrapolated from the mouse biodistribution and confirms the clinical translatability of Ac-225-PRIT. Furthermore, longitudinal therapy studies performed in subcutaneous and orthotopic PDAC models confirm the therapeutic efficacy of Ac-225-PRIT with the observation of prolonged median survival compared with control cohorts. Finally, a comparison with conventional RIT highlighted the potential of Ac-225-PRIT to reduce hematotoxicity while maintaining therapeutic effectiveness. Conclusions: The ability of Ac-225-PRIT to deliver a radio-therapeutic payload while simultaneously reducing the off-target toxicity normally associated with RIT suggests that the clinical translation of this approach will have a profound impact on PDAC therapy.

Twelve healthy subjects were treated with atomoxetine in an open-label, multiple-dose exploratory study. Plasma atomoxetine reached steady state by day 6, and the pharmacokinetic results demonstrated availability of atomoxetine to the central nervous system. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/plasma ratios of atomoxetine based on area under concentration-time curve from 0 to 12 hours postdose (AUC0-12), maximum concentration (C-max), and predose were 0.3%, 0.2%, and 11%, respectively. Plasma from atomoxetine-treated subjects (ex vivo) significantly inhibited radioligand binding to human NET (P < 0.001) only 1 hour after dosing. Plasma DHPG and DHPG/norepinephrine (ratio) during repeated posture tests were reduced significantly (P < 0.001) on day 5 and stayed significantly reduced up to 1 day after treatment. In CSF, both DHPG and the ratio were significantly reduced (P < 0.001) on day 18. Urine results showed significant decreases for both DHPG and the ratio (P = 0.010 to P < 0.001). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor in CSF was lesser than the limits of detection. The findings suggest that NET blockade can be assessed with DHPG concentration or with the ratio in plasma, CSF, and urine. The data suggest that DHPG is a useful biomarker to proactively assess the pharmacological activity of compounds intended to inhibit NET activity within the brain. The study shows that CSF is a medium for early identification and quantification of biomarkers useful in assessing novel neuroscience targets.

The mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO) is known to be upregulated in reactive microglia. Accurate visualization and quantification of microglial density by PET imaging using the TSPO tracer [C-11]-R-PK11195 has been challenging due to the limitations of the ligand. In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the new TSPO tracer [C-11]PBR28 as a marker for microglial activation in the 5XFAD transgenic mouse model of AD. Dynamic PET scans were acquired following intravenous administration of [C-11] PBR28 in 6-month-old 5XFAD mice and in wild-type controls. Autoradiography with [H-3]PBR28 was carried out in the same brains to further confirm the distribution of the radioligand. In addition, immunohistochemistry was performed on adjacent brain sections of the same mice to evaluate the co-localization of TSPO with microglia. PET imaging revealed that brain uptake of [C-11]PBR28 in 5XFAD mice was increased compared with control mice. Moreover, binding of [H-3]PBR28, measured by autoradiography, was enriched in cortical and hippocampal brain regions, coinciding with the positive staining of the microglial marker Iba-1 and amyloid deposits in the same areas. Furthermore, double-staining using antibodies against TSPO demonstrated co-localization of TSPO with microglia and not with astrocytes in 5XFAD mice and human post-mortem AD brains.

In the radioligand-binding assay, CS-3150 inhibited H-3-aldosterone binding to mineralocorticoid receptor with an IC50 value of 9.4 nM, and its potency was superior to that of spironolactone and eplerenone, whose IC(50)s were 36 and 713 nM, respectively. CS-3150 also showed at least 1000-fold higher selectivity for mineralocorticoid receptor over other steroid hormone receptors, glucocorticoid receptor, androgen receptor and progesterone receptor. In the reporter gene assay, CS-3150 inhibited aldosterone-induced transcriptional activation of human mineralocorticoid receptor with an IC50 value of 3.7 Oil, and its potency was superior to that of spironolactone and eplerenone, whose IC(50)s were 66 and 970 nM, respectively. CS-3150 had no agonistic effect on mineralocorticoid receptor and did not show any antagonistic or agonistic effect on glucocorticoid receptor, androgen receptor and progesterone receptor even at the high concentration of 5 mu M. In adrenalectomized rats, single oral administration of CS-3150 suppressed aldosterone-induced decrease in urinary Na+/K+ ratio, an index of in vivo mineralocorticoid receptor activation, and this suppressive effect was more potent and longer-lasting than that of spironolactone and eplerenone. Chronic treatment with CS-3150 inhibited blood pressure elevation induced by deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)/saltloading to rats, and this antihypertensive effect was more potent than that of spironolactone and eplerenone. These findings indicate that CS-3150 is a selective and highly potent mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist with long-lasting oral activity. This agent could be useful for the treatment of hypertension, cardiovascular and renal disorders. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Rats received injections of 5 mg/kg L-DOPA, 10 mg/kg L-DOPA or vehicle. Motor and exploratory behaviors were assessed for 30 min in an open field prior to administration of [1231]FP-CIT. Dopamine transporter binding was measured with small animal single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) 2 h after radioligand administration for 60 min. Results: Both L-DOPA doses significantly reduced DAT binding and led to significantly less head-shoulder motility and more sitting relative to vehicle. Moreover, 10 mg/kg L-DOPA induced less distance traveled and ambulation than 5 mg/kg L-DOPA. Analysis of time behavior (t-b) curves showed that L-DO PA-treated animals relative to vehicle exhibited (1) a faster rate of increase in duration of sitting; (2) a slower rate of increase in duration of head-shoulder motility; and (3) a slower rate of decrease in frequency of head-shoulder motility. Conclusions: The reductions of striatal DAT binding after L-DOPA challenges reflected elevated concentrations of synaptic DA. L-DOPA-treated animals showed less head-shoulder motility and more sitting than vehicle-treated animals, indicating an association between less behavioral activity and increased availability of striatal DA. The faster increase of sitting duration to a higher final level and the slower increase of head-shoulder motility to a lower final level relative to controls may be interpreted in terms on behavioral habituation to a novel environment.

In this study, we searched for an elongated Tr beta 2-like subtype with one additional exon N. We successfully isolated the entire mRNA/cDNA of a novel elongated Tr beta 2 isoform via PCR in the rat pituitary gland. The mRNA/cDNA was only 108 bps (exon N) longer than that Tr beta 2, and the extension of the sequence was between exon 3 and 4 of Tr beta. The whole sequence of this novel Tr beta isoform has been published in NCBI GenBank (HM043807.1); it is named TRbeta2Delta (Tr beta 2 Delta). In adult rat pituitary tissue, quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that the mRNA levels of Tr beta 2 Delta and Tr beta 2 were roughly equal (P > 0.05). We cloned, expressed, and purified the His-Tr beta 2 Delta protein [recombinant TR beta 2 Delta (rTR beta 2 Delta)]. SDS-PAGE and western blotting revealed that the molecular weight of rTR beta 2 Delta was 58.2 kDa. Using a radioligand binding assay and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, rTR beta 2 Delta-bound T3 with high affinity and recognized thyroid hormone response element (TRE) binding sites. Finally, in vitro transfection experiments further confirmed that rTR beta 2 Delta binding T3 significantly promotes the transcription of target genes via the TRE. Here, we have provided evidence suggesting that rTR beta 2 Delta is a novel functional TR isoform.

They offer an intriguing view into the nature of the receptor-G protein complex, but their usefulness depends upon the stability of the fusion. Methods: Fusion proteins of the M-2 muscarinic receptor and the alpha-subunit of G(i1) were expressed in CHO and Sf9 cells, extracted in digitonin-cholate, and examined for their binding properties and their electrophoretic mobility on western blots. Results: Receptor fused to native alpha(i1) underwent proteolysis near the point of fusion to release a fragment with the mobility of alpha(i1). The cleavage was prevented by truncation of the a-subunit at position 18. Binding of the agonist oxotremorine-M to the stable fusion protein from St9 cells was biphasic, and guanylylimidodiphosphate promoted an apparent interconversion of sites from higher to lower affinity. With receptor from CHO cells, the apparent capacity for N-[H-3]methylscopolamine was 60% of that for [H-3]quinuclidinylbenzilate: binding at saturating concentrations of the latter was inhibited in a noncompetitive manner at low concentrations of unlabeled N-methylscopolamine. Conclusions: A stable fusion protein of the M-2 receptor and truncated alpha(i1) resembles the native receptor-G protein complex with respect to the guanyl nucleotide-sensitive binding of agonists and the noncompetitive binding of antagonists. General significance: Release of the alpha-subunit is likely to occur with other such fusion proteins, rendering the data ambiguous or misleading. The properties of a chemically stable fusion protein support the notion that signaling proceeds via a stable multimeric complex of receptor and G protein. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Thus, release of endogenous DA induced by the administration of amphetamine decreases ligand binding, whereas DA depletion increases binding. This is generally thought to be due to competition between endogenous DA and the radioligands for D2 receptors. However, the temporal discrepancy between amphetamine-induced increases in DA as measured by microdialysis, which last on the order of 2 h, and the prolonged decrease in ligand binding, which lasts up to a day, has suggested that agonist-induced D2 receptor internalization may contribute to the sustained decrease in D2 receptor-binding potential seen following a DA surge. To test this hypothesis, we developed an in vitro system showing robust agonist-induced D2 receptor internalization following treatment with the agonist quinpirole. Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were stably co-transfected with human D2 receptor, G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 and arrestin 3. Agonist-induced D2 receptor internalization was demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, and radioligand competition binding. The binding of seven D2 antagonists and four agonists to the surface and internalized receptors was measured in intact cells. All the imaging ligands bound with high affinity to both surface and internalized D2 receptors. Affinity of most of the ligands to internalized receptors was modestly lower, indicating that internalization would reduce the binding potential measured in imaging studies carried out with these ligands. However, between-ligand differences in the magnitude of the internalization-associated affinity shift only partly accounted for the data obtained in neuroimaging experiments, suggesting the involvement of mechanisms beyond competition and internalization.

Aggression is also known to be modified by sex hormones, which exert influence on serotonergic neurotransmission. The present study aimed to elucidate potential interactions between human aggression, the inhibitory serotonergic 5-HT1A receptor, and sex hormones. Experimental Design: Thirty-three healthy volunteers (16 women, aged 26.24 +/- 5.5 yr) completed a validated questionnaire incorporating five dimensions of aggression. Subsequently, all subjects underwent positron emission tomography with the radioligand [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635 to quantity 5-HT1A binding potentials (BPNDS) in the prefrontal cortex, limbic areas, and midbrain. Also, plasmas levels of testosterone, 17 beta-estradiol and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) were measured. Relations between aggression scores, regional 5-HT1A BPNDS, and hormone levels were analyzed using Correlations, multivariate analyses of variance, and linear regressions. Principal Observations: statistical analyses revealed higher 5-HT1A receptor BPNDS in subjects exhibiting higher aggression scores in prefrontal (all P < 0.041) and anterior cingulate cortices (P = 0.016). More aggressive subjects were also characterized by lower SHBG levels (P = 0.015). Moreover, higher SHBG levels were associated with lower 5-HT1A BPNDS in frontal (P = 0.048) and cingulate cortices (all P < 0.013) and in the amygdala (P = 0.03). Conclusions: The present study provides first-time evidence for a specific interrelation between the 5-HT1A receptor distribution, se hormones, and aggression in humans. Our findings point to a reduced down-stream control due to higher amounts or activities of frontal 5-HT1A receptors in more aggressive subjects, which is presumably modulated by sex hormones.

Evaluation of the Brain 5-HT2A Receptor Binding Index in Dogs with Anxiety Disorders, Measured with <SUP>123</SUP>I-5I-R91150 and SPECT	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						anxiety disorders; SPECT; serotonin (5-HT); 5-HT2A receptor; dog	SEROTONIN REUPTAKE INHIBITOR; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; PANIC DISORDER; MAJOR DEPRESSION; I-123-5-I-R91150; TRAITS; CORTEX; NOREPINEPHRINE; ANTAGONIST	The serotonergic system has been implicated in emotional and cognitive functions since early work. In particular, an important role has been attributed to the 5-HT2A receptor in schizophrenia, depression, eating disorders, and anxiety. The aim of the study was to evaluate the involvement of the brain 5-HT2A receptor in dogs with severe anxiety disorder, using I-123-5I-R91150 and SPECT. Methods: SPECT was performed with the 5-HT2A receptor-specific radioligand I-123-5I-R91150 to determine the 5-HT2A receptor binding index (131) in the brains of dogs. Sixteen dogs with pathologic anxiety problems were compared with 22 normal-behaving reference dogs. Results: Lower 5-HT2A receptor BI was found in the left (P = 0.001) and right (P = 0.002) frontal cortices in the group of dogs with anxiety disorders than in the reference group. Right (P = 0.022) and left (P = 0.048) temporocortical BIs were also significantly lower in the dogs with anxiety disorders. Finally, the BI was significantly lower in the right occipital cortex (P = 0.038) of dogs with anxiety disorders than in the reference dogs. After correction for multiple comparisons (P < 0.0056), only the bilateral frontocortical lower BI remained significant. Conclusion: The findings in this study indicate that the 5-HT2A receptor is involved in the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders in dogs. The affected brain regions are in concordance with the brain regions involved in human anxiety disorders. The acquired data confirm the potential of using the dog as a natural model for investigation of the different mechanisms of anxiety disorders. In this regard, the use of dogs may contribute to the development of novel treatment approaches and new drugs for veterinary and human use.

To investigate whether the serological marker for coeliac disease, tissue transglutaminase autoantibody (tTGAb), is associated with decreased bone mass density (BMD) and increased frequency of fractures in middle-aged women screened for osteoporosis. Material and methods. The study comprised 6480 women (mean age 56 years, range 50-64) who answered a number of questionnaires and who underwent dual X-ray absorptiometry of the wrist bone. Serum samples were analysed for tTGAb using radioligand binding assays. A tTGAb level of 4 U/ml was used to determine a positive value and a level of 17 U/ml was used as an alternative discrimination of high levels. Results. A tTGAb level 4 U/ml was found among 90/6480 (1.4%) women and correlated with lower BMD (multiple linear regression coefficient -382.1; 95% CI = - 673.6-90.7, p=0.011) and with fracture frequency (r=0.18, p=0.023). The 59 women with tTGAb levels 17 U/ml had a lower BMD (0.410.08 g/cm2 versus 0.440.08 g/cm2, p=0.001) and a lower T-score (-1.401.28 versus -0.901.40, p=0.003) as well as a higher prevalence of osteoporosis (13.4% versus 6.5%, p=0.008) compared with the remaining 6421 women with tTGAb levels 17 U/ml. Furthermore, fracture frequency was more pronounced in women with tTGAb levels 17 U/ml, among whom 19/59 (32.2%) had fractures during the study period compared with 1204/6421 (18.8%) among women with tTGAb levels 17 U/ml (p=0.009). Conclusions. High levels of tTGAb indicating coeliac disease are associated with lower BMD and higher fracture frequency in women between 50 and 64 years of age. Osteometry is therefore warranted in middle-aged women detected with tTGAb.

Rat-1 fibroblasts were transfected with a plasmid construction containing enhanced green fluorescent protein joined to the carboxyl terminus of the human alpha(1B)-adrenoceptor. Receptors were identified by radioligand binding and photoaffinity labeling, and were immunoprecipitated with an antiserum generated against the enhanced green fluorescent protein. The receptor was functional, as evidenced by noradrenaline action on intracellular calcium and inositol phosphate production. IGF-I had no significant effect by itself on these parameters but markedly reduced the effects of noradrenaline. IGF-I induced alpha(1B)-adrenoceptor phosphorylation, which was markedly reduced by the following agents: pertussis toxin, a metalloproteinase inhibitor, diphtheria toxin mutant CRM 197, an epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor intrinsic kinase activity inhibitor, and by phosphoinositide 3-kinase and protein kinase C inhibitors. IGF-I action appears to involve activation of a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein, shedding of heparin-binding EGF and autocrine activation of EGF receptors. G protein subunits and phosphotyrosine residues stimulate phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity leading to activation of protein kinase C, which in turn phosphorylates alpha(1B)-adrenoceptors. Confocal fluorescent microscopy showed that alpha(1B)-adrenoceptors fussed to the green fluorescent protein were located in plasma membrane and intracellular vesicles in the basal state. IGF-I induced receptor redistribution favoring the intracellular location; this effect was blocked by hypertonic sucrose and concanavalin A. Our data show that IGF-I induces alpha(1B)-adrenoceptor desensitization associated to receptor phosphorylation and internalization. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, the pharmacology of JNJ- 17156516 was investigated both in vitro and in vivo, and the pharmacokinetic profile was evaluated in rats. JNJ- 17156516 expressed high-affinity at the cloned human ( pK(l) = 7.96 +/- 0.11), rat ( pK(l) = 8.02 +/- 0.11), and canine (pK(l) = 7.98 +/- 0.04) CCK1 receptors, and it was also highly selective for the CCK1 receptor compared with the CCK2 receptor across the same species (160-,230-, and 75- fold, respectively). The high affinity of JNJ- 17156516 at CCK1 receptors in vitro was confirmed in radioligand binding studies on fresh human gallbladder tissue ( pK(l) = 8.22 +/- 0.05). In a functional in vitro assay of guinea pig gallbladder contraction, JNJ- 17156516 behaved as a competitive antagonist, with a pK(B) value of 8.00 +/- 0.07. In vivo, JNJ-17156516 produced a parallel, rightward shift in the CCK-8S-evoked contraction of the guinea pig gallbladder. The dose required to shift the CCK-8S dose-response curve was 240 nmol kg(-1) i v. In the anesthetized rat, JNJ- 17156516 produced a dose-related decrease in the number of duodenal contractions evoked by infusion of CCK-8S, with an ED50 = 484 nmol kg(-1). Pharmacokinetic analysis of JNJ- 17156516 in rats, revealed that JNJ17156516 had a half-life of 3.0 +/- 0.5 h and a very high bioavailability (108 +/- 10%) in this species. Overall, we have demonstrated that JNJ- 17156516 is a high-affinity selective human CCK1 receptor antagonist with good pharmacokinetic properties in rats.

Double-label immunohistochemical procedures can be utilized to examine the localization of receptors within specific neuronal populations. In order to conduct such studies, however, it was first necessary to examine the utility and specificity of two commercially available anti-5-HT2CR antibodies [from Santa Cruz (SC) and BD PharMingen (PH)]. In male Sprague-Dawley rats, both antibodies produced widespread immunoreactivity (IR) throughout the brain area chosen for study, the ventral tegmental area, which is the origin of the dopamine mesocorticoaccumbens "reward" pathway. Co-labeling with the SC and PH 5-HT2CR antibodies demonstrated that IR for the two antibodies largely overlapped. However, SC 5-HT2CR IR was more concentrated within IR cell bodies and was more consistent among assays than the PH 5-HT2CR IR. Thus, the SC 5-HT2CR antibody was chosen for subsequent studies. When. examined in 5-HT2CR knockout vs. wild-type mice, the SC 5-HT2CR antibody produced widespread IR in wild-type, but not 5-HT2CR knockout, mice. In addition, 5-HT2CR-IR was not present in either native CHO cells, known to be devoid of 5-HT2AR or 5-HT2CR, or in CHO cells transfected with the 5-HT2AR. Thus, these studies suggest that the SC 5-HT2CR antibody produces reliable staining selective for 5-HT2CR vs. 5-HT2AR in rodent brains and is therefore suitable for use in future immunofluorescence 5-HT2CR localization studies.

Methods: HLA genotypes were determined in dried blood spots of cord blood from a total of 16,709 children born to healthy mothers in the Diabetes Prediction in Skane (DiPiS) study, a population-based observational clinical investigation of newborn children. Children born to mothers with diabetes or gestational diabetes were excluded. Autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65Ab) and insulinoma-associated protein 2 were determined in standard radioligand binding assays. Birthweight was adjusted for gestational age and divided into quartiles. The upper quartile was defined as high relative birthweight (HrBW) and the lower quartile as low relative birthweight (LrBW). Results: Genotypes conferring risk of type 1 diabetes were strongly associated with relative birthweight (rBW) (p=0.01). The high-risk HLA-DQ2/8, DQ8/0604 and DQ8/X genotypes were associated with HrBW (odds ratio [OR] [95% CI]=1.20 [1.08-1.33], p=0.0006). The HLA-DQB1*0603 allele, which is negatively associated with type 1 diabetes, was also associated with HrBW (p=0.025), confirming a previous report on DQB1*0603-linked HLA-DR13. GAD65Ab were negatively associated with HrBW (OR [95% CI]=0.72 [0.56-0.93], p=0.01). Regression analysis showed that the HLA-associated increase in rBW was independent of confounding factors. Conclusions/Interpreation: HLA genotypes may be associated with intrauterine growth independent of type 1 diabetes risk. The epidemiological observation that high birthweight is a risk factor for type 1 diabetes could possibly result from a moderating effect on intrauterine growth of HLA genotypes conferring a high risk of diabetes.

Recently, membrane sites for different steroids have been also identified, mediating rapid, non-genoinic, steroid actions. Membrane sites for estrogen and androgen have been found in a number of different cell types, bearing or not classical intracellular receptors. In the present study, with the use of radioligand binding, flow cytometry and confocal laser microscopy, we report that T47D human breast cancer cells express specific and saturable membrane receptors for both estrogen (KD 4.06 +/- 3.31 nM) and androgen (K-D 7.64 +/- 3.15 nM). Upon activation with BSA-conjugated, non-permeable ligands (E-2-BSA and testosterone-BSA), membrane estrogen receptors protect cells from serum-deprivation-induced apoptosis, while androgen receptors induce apoptosis in serum-supplemented T47D cells. In addition, co-incubation of cells with a fixed concentration of one steroid and varying concentrations of the other reversed the abovementioned effect (apoptosis for androgen, and anti-apoptosis for E-2) suggesting that the fate of the cell depends on the relative concentration of either steroid in the culture medium. We also report the identification of membrane receptors for E-2 and androgen in biopsy slides from breast cancer patients. Both sites are expressed, with the staining for membrane E-2 being strongly present in ER-negative, less differentiated, more aggressive tumors. These findings suggest that aromatase inhibitors may exert their beneficial effects on breast cancer by also propagating the metabolism of local steroids towards androgen, inducing thus cell apoptosis through membrane androgen receptor activation.

The structural features of the binding sites for these anesthetic steroids on GABAA receptors have not been determined. To determine how structural modifications at the steroid C-6 and C-7 positions effect the actions of these anesthetic steroids, an axial or equatorial methyl group was introduced at these positions. The analogues were evaluated (1) in [S-35]-tert-butylbicyclophosphorothionate binding experiments, (2) in electrophysiological experiments using rat alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2L) GABA(A) receptors expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, and (3) as tadpole anesthetics. The effects of methyl group substitution in the 5 alpha- and 5 beta-reduced series of compounds were strikingly similar. In both series, a 6 beta-Me group gave compounds with actions similar to or greater than those of the parent steroids. A 6 alpha-, 7 beta- or 7 alpha-Me substituent resulted in reduced potency for inhibition of radioligand binding, GABA(A) receptor modulation and tadpole anesthesia. Because of the similar effects of methyl group substitution in the two series of compounds and previous results from other studies showing that structural modifications in the steroid D ring/side chain region produce similar effects regardless of the stereochemistry of the A,B-ring fusion, we propose that either the 3 alpha-hydroxyl groups of planar and nonplanar anesthetic steroids hydrogen bond to different amino acids on GABA(A) receptors or that this critical hydrogen bonding group interacts with membrane lipids instead of the receptor.

The properties of the novel antagonist candidates were compared to known antagonists. A new antagonist structure with a reduced, primer alcohol C-terminus, Ac-Arg-Tyr-Tyr-Arg-Ile-lysinol (Ac-RYYRIK-ol) was described in the mouse vas deferens tests, showing an equilibrium inhibitory constant value (Kc) of 2.44 nM, and no agonist effect at 10 muM ligand concentration. Schild-analysis indicated a clearly competitive interaction at the NOP receptor, whereas the peptide did not affect the action of the delta-opioid receptor agonist [D-Ala(2),D-Leu(5)]enkephalin. Ac-RYYRIK-ol also exhibited a high affinity in [H-3]nociceptin-NH2 binding competition assays using rat brain membranes. Agonist-induced G-protein activation via NOP receptors was studied in [S-35]GTPgammaS binding stimulation assays by the use of both native brain tissue preparations and membranes from cultured CHO cells expressing recombinant nociceptin receptors. Ac-RYYRIK-ol displayed only weak intrinsic agonist activity, whereas it effectively inhibited the stimulation generated by nociceptin. The results support the high potency and antagonist nature of Ac-RYYRIK-ol and reveal important roles for both the N- and the C-terminal region of the molecule. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Chemerin is synthesized as a secreted precursor, prochemerin, which is poorly active, but converted into a full agonist of chemerinR by proteolytic removal of the last six amino acids. In the present work, we have synthesized a number of peptides derived from the C-terminal domain of human prochemerin and have investigated their functional properties as agonists or antagonists of human chemerinR. We found that the nonapeptide (149)YFPGQFAFS(157) (chemerin-9), corresponding to the C terminus of processed chemerin, retained most of the activity of the full-size protein, with regard to agonism toward the chemerinR. Extension of this peptide at its N terminus did not increase the activity, whereas further truncations rapidly resulted in inactive compounds. The C-terminal end of the peptide appeared crucial for its activity, as addition of a single amino acid or removal of two amino acids modified the potency by four orders of magnitude. Alanine- scanning mutagenesis identified residues Tyr(149), Phe(150), Gly(152), Phe(154), and Phe(156) as the key positions for chemerinR activation. A modified peptide (YHSFFFPGQFAFS) was synthesized and iodinated, and a radioligand binding assay was established. It was found that the ability of the various peptides to activate the chemerin receptor was strictly correlated with their affinity in the binding assay. These results confirm that a precise C-terminal processing is required for the generation of a chemerinR agonist. The possibility to restrict a medium sized protein to a nonapeptide, while keeping a low nanomolar affinity for its receptor is unusual among G protein-coupled receptors ligands. The identification of these short bioactive peptides will considerably accelerate the pharmacological analysis of chemerin-chemerinR interactions.

The radioligand-binding assay was used to test the binding of L-lySine to various 5-HT receptors. The effects of L-lysine on 5-HT-induced contractions of isolated guinea pig ileum were studied in vitro. The effects of oral administration of L-lysine on diarrhea, stress-induced fecal excretion, and 5-HT-induced corticosterone release, tachycardia, and anxiety (an elevated plus maze paradigm) were studied in rats in vivo. L-Lysine (0.8 mmol/dl) inhibited (9.17%) binding of 5-HT to the 5-HT4 receptor, without any effect on 5-HT1A,2A,2B,2C,3 binding. L-Lysine (0.07 and 0.7 mmol/dl) blocked 5-HT-induced contractions of an isolated guinea pig ileum in vitro (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01). Orally applied L-lysine (1 g/kg of body weight) inhibited (P < 0.12) diarrhea triggered by coadministration of restraint stress and 5-hydroxytryptophane (10 mg/kg of body weight), and significantly blocked anxiety induced by the 5-HT4 receptor agonist (3.0 mmol/liter) in rats in vivo. No effects of L-lysine or the 5-HT4 receptor agonist on plasma corticosterone and heart rate were recorded. L-Lysine may be a partial 5-HT4 receptor antagonist and suppresses 5-HT4 receptor-mediated intestinal pathologies and anxiety in rats. An increase in nutritional load of L-lysine might be a useful tool in treating stress-induced anxiety and 5-HT-related diarrhea-type intestinal dysfunctions.

The mechanism by which electrical stimulation of the STN ameliorates symptoms of PD remains unknown. One consistent aspect of STN stimulation is the ability to reduce the dosage of dopaminergic medications; sometimes they can be eliminated altogether. Furthermore, nigrostriatal projection axons are apposed to the dorsal surface of the STN and are likely affected by the application of current in this region. We sought to determine whether STN stimulation could release endogenous striatal dopamine. METHODS: Five patients with PD, who had previously undergone surgical implantation of bilateral STN stimulators underwent [C-11] raclopride positron emission tomo-graphic scanning. L-dopa was withheld for 12 hours, and both stimulators were turned off 9 hours before scanning. We assayed for striatal dopamine release by measuring radioligand displacement as a consequence turning on the right STN stimulator after 45 minutes of a 90-minute [C-11] raclopride infusion. Patients were evaluated with the motor section of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale before and after the studies. RESULTS: Comparisons between the right and left striata, before and after right STN stimulation, demonstrated no-significant differences in [Cl-11] raclopride binding, despite significant improvements in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor scores with unilateral stimulation (mean improvement, 26.0 +/- 16.4%; P < 0.05). This finding was also noted when the striaturn was partitioned into dorsal and ventral caudate and putamen and the four regions were analyzed separately. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that STN stimulation does not mediate its anti-PD effects via the release of dopamine, as assessed with [C-11] raclopride displacement.

Materials and Subjects: Male Wistar rats (eight per group) were injected with ondansetron (2 and 4 mg/kg s. c.) or CP 93 129 (0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg s. c.) 15 min before paracetamol (400 mg/kg, i.p.). Methods: Pain threshold was evaluated in the hot-plate or in the paw pressure test 30 min after the last treatment. 5-HT3 receptor binding capacity was measured in the frontal cortex, temporal-parietal cortex and midbrain by means of radioligand binding technique. Statistical analysis was done using ANOVA followed by Student-Newman-Keuls test and 2 X 2 factorial analysis when appropriate. Results: Pre-treatment with ondansetron, at doses of 2 and 4 mg/kg, did not affect the antinociceptive activity of paracetamol in the hot-plate test and in the paw pressure test. Paracetamol did not change the characteristics of 5-HT3 receptors in all the areas investigated. Ondansetron (4 mg/kg s. c) per se significantly increased the 5-HT3 receptor number in the areas used, the effect not being modified by co-administration with paracetamol. On the other hand, CP 93129 (2 mg/kg s. c.) significantly prevented the effect of paracetamol in both algesimetric tests used. Conclusions: Our data indicate that 5-HT1B but not 5-HT3 receptors are involved in the antinociceptive effect of paracetamol in our experimental conditions.

METHODS: After administration of GGP, the levels of insulin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), lactic acid (LC), and oxygen consumption, as well as blood glucose (BG) and liver glycogen (LG) were measured. Based on these measurement results, the effects of GGP on insulin secretion and anaerobic/aerobic glycolysis were evaluated. Adenylate cyclase (AQ activity and cAMP level were measured to study the effects of GGP on BG and LG metabolism and to determine whether the effects were through second transmiting message system. Propranolol (P-receptor antagonist) and phentolamine ((x-receptor antagonist) were used to investigate whether hypoglycemic activity of GGP was through beta- or (alpha-adrenoceptor. [H-3]DHA (antagonist of P-adrenoceptor) was used to determine GGP binding affinity to beta-adrenoceptor. Citrate synthetase (CTS), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), and cytochrome oxidase (CCO) activities were measured to explore GGP effects on aerobic glycolysis in liver mitochondria. Phosphorylase (PP) activity was measured to study GGP effects on liver glycogen metabolism. RESULTS: cAMP content and AC activity were increased when BG and LG contents in liver of mice decreased. The decrease in liver glycogen induced by GGP was inhibited by pretreatment with propranolol. Radioligand receptor assay showed that GGP was competing in vitro with [3 H]DHA to bind to beta-adrenoceptor of duck erythrocyte membrane, and IC50 of GGP was 63 nmol/L. GGP inhibited LDH activity at an appropriate dosage, at which contents of BG and LG could be effectively lowered. GGP also stimulated activities of SDH, MDH, CCO, CTS, and PP. CONCLUSION: The hypoglycemic activity of GGP may be attributed to the enhancement of aerobic glycolysis through stimulation of adrenoceptor and increase of various rate-limiting enzyme activities related to tricarboxylic acid cycle.

Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an important modulator of glial cell responses in the brain. In the present study we describe the expression of IL-10 and the IL-10 receptor (IL-10R1) in primary cocultures of rat microglial and astroglial cells. Using quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA, we show that IL-10 mRNA expression and subsequent IL-10 secretion is time-dependently induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). IL-10R1, however, is constitutively expressed in glial cell cocultures, as shown by RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry. Radioligand binding studies using I-125-IL-10 reveal that rat glial cells express a single binding site with an apparent affinity of approximately 600 pM for human IL-10. Observations in enriched cultures of either microglial or astroglial cells indicate that both cell types express IL-10 mRNA and are capable of secreting IL-10. Both cell types also express IL-10R1 mRNA and protein. However, in glial cell cocultures immunoreactive IL-10R1 protein is predominantly observed in astrocytes, suggesting that microglial expression of IL-10R1 in cocultures is suppressed by astrocytes. In addition, exogenous IL-10 is highly potent in down-regulating LPS-induced IL-1beta and IL-10 mRNA, and, at a higher dose, IL-10R1 mRNA in untreated and LPS-treated cultures, suggesting that IL-10 autoregulates its expression and inhibits that of IL-1beta at the transcriptional level. Together the findings support the concept that IL-10, produced by activated microglial and astroglial cells, modulates glia-mediated inflammatory responses through high-affinity IL-10 receptors via paracrine and autocrine interactions.

Competition for I-125-ABOPX(I-125-3-(4-amino-3-iodobenzyl)-8-(phenyl-4-oxyacetate)-1-propylxanthine) binding in membranes of stably transfected HEK-293 cells revealed uniformly higher affinity (<10-fold) of these xanthines for human than for rat A(2B) adenosine receptors. Binding to rat brain membranes expressing A(1) and A(2A) adenosine receptors revealed greater A(2B) selectivity over A(2A) than A(1) receptors. Substitution at the 1-position with 2-phenylethyl (or alkyl/olefinic groups) and at N-3 with hydrogen or methyl favored A(2B) selectivity. Relative. to enprofylline 2b, pentoxifylline 35 was equipotent and 1-propylxanthine 3 was >13-fold more potent at human A(2B) receptors. Most N-7 substituents did not enhance affinity over hydrogen, except for 7-(2-chloroethyl), which enhanced the affinity of theophylline by 6.5-fold to 800 nM. The A2B receptor affinity-enhancing effects of 7-(2-chloroethyl) vs 7-methyl were comparable to the known enhancement produced by an 8-aryl substitution. Among 8-phenyl analogues, a larger alkyl group at the 1-position than at the 3-position favored affinity at the human A2B receptor, as indicated by 1-allyl-3-methyl-8-phenylxanthine, with a K-i value of 37 nM. Substitution on the 8-phenyl ring indicated that an electron-rich ring was preferred for A2B receptor binding. In conclusion, new leads for the design of xanthines substituted in the 1-, 3-, 7-, and 8-positions as A(2B) receptor-selective antagonists have been identified.

The effect of mutating this histidine at position 105 in the alpha5 subunit to an arginine (alpha5H105R) on BZ-site pharmacology has been investigated using radioligand binding on HEK293 and L(tk-) cells and two electrode voltage clamp recording on Xenopus oocytes in which GABA(A) receptors of subtypes alpha5, alpha5H1058, alpha4 and alpha6 were co-expressed with beta3gamma2s. 2 The classical BZs, diazepam and flunitrazepam (full agonists on the alpha5 receptor) showed negligible affinity and therefore negligible efficacy on alpha5H105R receptors. The beta-carbolines DMCM and betaCCE (inverse agonists on the alpha5 receptor) retained some affinity but did not exhibit inverse agonist efficacy at alpha5H105R receptors. Therefore, the alpha5H105R mutation confers an alpha4/alpha6-like pharmacology to the classical BZs and beta-carbolines. 3 Ro15-4513, flumazenil, bretazenil and FG8094. which share a common imidazobenzodiazepine core structure, retained high affinity and were higher efficacy agonists on alpha5H105R receptors than would be predicted from an alpha4/alpha6 pharmacological profile. This effect was antagonized by DMCM, which competes for the BZ-site and therefore is likely to be mediated via the BZ-site. 4 These data indicate that the conserved histidine residue in the a subunit is not only a key determinant in the affinity of BZ-site ligands on alpha5 containing GABA(A) receptors, but also influences ligand efficacy.

J	Whistler, JL; Tsao, P; von Zastrow, M				Whistler, JL; Tsao, P; von Zastrow, M			A phosphorylation-regulated brake mechanism controls the initial endocytosis of opioid receptors but is not required for post-endocytic sorting to lysosomes.	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; BETA-ADRENERGIC-RECEPTOR; NG108-15 HYBRID-CELLS; DOWN-REGULATION; OPIATE RECEPTOR; MOLECULAR MECHANISMS; KINASE-C; DESENSITIZATION; ARRESTIN; RESENSITIZATION	The delta -opioid receptor (DOR) can undergo proteolytic down-regulation by endocytosis of receptors followed by sorting of internalized receptors to lysosomes. Although phosphorylation of the receptor is thought to play an important role in controlling receptor downregulation, previous studies disagree on whether phosphorylation is actually required for the agonist-induced endocytosis of opioid receptors. Furthermore, no previous studies have determined whether phosphorylation is required for subsequent sorting of internalized receptors to lysosomes. We have addressed these questions by examining the endocytic trafficking of a series of mutant versions of DOR expressed in stably transfected HEK 293 cells. Our results confirm that phosphorylation is not required for agonist-induced endocytosis of truncated mutant receptors that lack the distal carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain containing sites of regulatory phosphorylation. However, phosphorylation is required for endocytosis of full-length receptors. Mutation of all serine/threonine residues located in the distal carboxyl-terminal tail domain of the full-length receptor to alanine creates functional mutant receptors that exhibit no detectable agonist-induced endocytosis. Substitution of these residues with aspartate restores the ability of mutant receptors to undergo agonist-induced endocytosis. Studies using green fluorescent protein-tagged versions of arrestin-3 suggest that the distal tail domain, when not phosphorylated, inhibits receptor-mediated recruitment of beta -arrestins to the plasma membrane. Biochemical and radioligand binding studies indicate that, after endocytosis occurs, phosphorylation-defective mutant receptors traffic to lysosomes with similar kinetics as wild type receptors. We conclude that phosphorylation controls endocytic trafficking of opioid receptors primarily by regulating a "brake" mechanism that prevents endocytosis of full-length receptors in the absence of phosphorylation. After endocytosis occurs, subsequent steps of membrane trafficking mediating sorting and transport to lysosomes do not require receptor phosphorylation.

Due to the crucial role of WI-1 in adherence and disease pathogenesis, we investigated how the protein localizes to the surface of B. dermatitidis, WI-1 released extracellularly by wild-type yeast coated the surfaces of co-cultured knockout yeast within 3 h of incubation, implying that secreted WI-1 provides a pathway for loading the protein onto the yeast cell wall. In radioligand binding assays, purified WI-1 bound saturably, specifically, and with high affinity (K-d = 8.3 x 10(-9)) to the cell surface of knockout yeast devoid of WI-1. WI-1 added exogenously, in vitro to knockout yeast was indistinguishable from native cell surface WI-1 by fluorescence staining and restored adhesivity to the knockout yeast in macrophage binding and phagocytosis assays. Analysis of interactions between WI-1 and elements of the yeast cell wall identified chitin as the anchor point for WI-1. This interaction was shown to hinge on the 24-amino acid tandem repeat sequence of WI-1, Efforts to extract surface WI-l from the yeast demonstrated that it is fastened to the wall by non-covalent interactions and covalent links between cysteine residues. We conclude that the yeast cell surface adhesin WI-1 localizes to the cell wall, in part, through extracellular release followed by high affinity binding back onto exposed chitin fibrils, These findings point to a novel pathway of cell wall biogenesis in yeast and an unanticipated role for chitin in anchoring and displaying a surface adhesin and virulence determinant.

Non-invasive imaging of DAT contributes to early diagnosis and monitoring of related diseases. Recently, we reported a deuterated [18F]fluoroethyl tropane analogue [18F]FECNT-d4 as a potential DAT PET imaging agent. The objective of this work was to extend the investigation by comparing four deuterated [18F]fluoroethyl tropane derivatives ([18F]2a-d) to develop metabolically stable DAT radioligands.Methods: Four fluoroethyl substituted phenyl-tropane compounds 1a-d and deuterated compounds 2a-d were synthesized and their IC50 values to DAT were evaluated. The [18F]fluoroethyl ligands [18F]1a-d and [18F]2ad were obtained from corresponding labeling precursors by one-step radio-labeling reactions and investigated in terms of lipophilicity and in vitro binding affinity studies. [18F]1d and [18F]2d were then selected for further evaluations by in vivo metabolism study, biodistribution, ex vivo autoradiography, and microPET imaging studies.Results: [18F]1a-d and [18F]2a-d were obtained in radiochemical yield of 11-32 % with molar activities of 28-54 GBq/mu mol. The 1d and 2d exhibited relatively high affinity to DAT (IC50: 1.9-2.1 nM). Ex vivo autoradiography and microPET studies showed that [18F]2d selectively localized on DAT-rich striatal regions and the specific signal could be blocked by DAT inhibitor. Biodistribution results showed that [18F]2d consistently exhibited a higher ratio of the target to non-target (striatum/cerebellum) than [18F]1d. Furthermore, metabolism study indicated that the in vivo metabolic stability of [18F]2d was superior to that of [18F]1d. Conclusion: Our findings suggested that the deuterated compound [18F]2d might be a potential probe for DAT PET imaging in the brain.

The recommended method for Lutathera administration is gravity infusion; however, other appropriate and safe techniques are possible. This work compares two infusion methods from a medico-economic, radiation protection, efficiency and practicality point of view. Methods Two infusion methods were studied, either involving a volumetric infusion pump (method 1) or a peristaltic pump (method 2). For each method, the mean residual activity per vial and the mean injection time were compared. Occupational radiation exposure was measured. The cost of initial equipment and consumables for one administration was determined. Feedback from operators and past incidents during injections were collected through a survey. Results Three operators performed 219 Lutathera injections over 70 months: 60.7% (133) with method 1 and 39.3% (86) with method 2. After infusion, the mean residual activity in vial was 124.3 +/- 16.9 MBq with method 1 and 80.9 +/- 19.3 MBq with method 2 (34.9% decrease). The average administration time was 41 +/- 7.2 min with method 1 and 39 +/- 8.5 min with method 2. Occupational exposures obtained with both methods were very low and quite similar. Method 1 required an initial investment of 1165.8 US$ plus 4.0 US$ of supplies for each administration. Initial investment for method 2 was comparable (1261.4 US$) but supplies cost per administration was higher (12.5 US$). Two major incidents were recorded with method 1 and none with method 2. From operators' experience, method 2 felt safer and more suitable. Conclusions Method 2 appeared to be convenient and secure, despite a higher cost per injection. It could also be applied to new radioligand therapies such as Lu-177-PSMA or Ac-225-Dotatate.

However, in vivo visualization of PDE7 in human brains has hitherto not been possible. Using the novel PET ligand C-11-MTP38, which we recently developed, we aimed to image and quantify PDE7 in living human brains. Methods Seven healthy males underwent a 90-min PET scan after injection of C-11-MTP38. We performed arterial blood sampling and metabolite analysis of plasma in six subjects to obtain a metabolite-corrected input function. Regional total distribution volumes (V(T)s) were estimated using compartment models, and Logan plot and Ichise multilinear analysis (MA1). We further quantified the specific radioligand binding using the original multilinear reference tissue model (MRTMO) and standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) method with the cerebellar cortex as reference. Results PET images with C-11-MTP38 showed relatively high retentions in several brain regions, including in the striatum, globus pallidus, and thalamus, as well as fast washout from the cerebellar cortex, in agreement with the known distribution of PDE7. V-T values were robustly estimated by two-tissue compartment model analysis (mean V-T = 4.2 for the pallidum), Logan plot, and MA1, all in excellent agreement with each other, suggesting the reversibility of C-11-MTP38 binding. Furthermore, there were good agreements between binding values estimated by indirect method and those estimated by both MRTMO and SUVR, indicating that these methods could be useful for reliable quantification of PDE7. Because MRTMO and SUVR do not require arterial blood sampling, they are the most practical for the clinical use of C-11-MTP38-PET. Conclusion We have provided the first demonstration of PET visualization of PDE7 in human brains. C-11-MTP38 is a promising novel PET ligand for the quantitative investigation of central PDE7.

"Catch-and-Release" Anti-Carcinoembryonic Antigen Monoclonal Antibody Leads to Greater Plasma and Tumor Exposure in a Mouse Model of Colorectal Cancer	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							NEONATAL FC-RECEPTOR; CARCINOEMBRYONIC ANTIGEN; THERAPEUTIC ANTIBODIES; IGG ANTIBODIES; CEA ANTIBODY; IN-VIVO; BINDING; PHARMACOKINETICS; PH; QUANTIFICATION	In this study, we examined the effects of target expression, neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) expression in tumors, and pH-dependent target binding on the disposition of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in murine models of colorectal cancer. A panel of anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) mAbs was developed via standard hybridoma technology and then evaluated for pH-dependent CEA binding. Binding was assessed via immunoassay and radioligand binding assays. 10H6, a murine IgG1 mAb with high affinity for CEA at pH = 7.4 (K-D = 12.6 +/- 1.7 nM) and reduced affinity at pH = 6.0 (K-D = 144.6 +/- 21.8 nM), and T84.66, which exhibits pH-independent CEA binding (K-D = 1.1 +/- 0.11 and 1.4 +/- 0.16 nM at pH 7.4 and 6.0), were selected for pharmacokinetic investigations. We evaluated pharmacokinetics after intravenous administration to control mice and to mice bearing tumors with (MC38(CEA+), LS174T) and without (MC38(CEA-)) CEA expression and with or without expression of murine FcRn, at doses of 0.1, 1, and 10 mg/kg. 10H6 displayed linear pharmacokinetics in mice bearing MC38(CEA+) or MC38(CEA-) tumors. T84.66 displayed linear pharmacokinetics in mice with MC38(CEA-) tumors but dose-dependent nonlinear pharmacokinetics in mice bearing MC38(CEA+). In addition to the improved plasma pharmacokinetic profile (i.e., linear pharmacokinetics, longer terminal half-life), 10H6 exhibited improved exposure in MC38(CEA+) tumors relative to T84.66. In mice bearing tumors with CEA expression, but lacking expression of murine FcRn (LS174T), 10H6 demonstrated nonlinear pharmacokinetics, with rapid clearance at low dose. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that pH-dependent CEA binding allows mAb dissociation from target in acidified endosomes, enabling FcRn-mediated protection from target-mediated elimination in mice bearing MC38(CEA+) tumors.

Ketamine and ketamine metabolites as novel estrogen receptor ligands: Induction of cytochrome P450 and AMPA glutamate receptor gene expression	BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Ketamine; Ketamine metabolites; Estrogens; CYP2A6; CYP2B6; AMPA receptors	SEX-DIFFERENCES; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; CANCER-RISK; DEPRESSION; WOMEN; INHIBITION; ESTRADIOL; THERAPY; CYP2A6; MTOR	Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the most common psychiatric illness worldwide, and it displays a striking sex-dependent difference in incidence, with two thirds of MDD patients being women. Ketamine treatment can produce rapid antidepressant effects in MDD patients, effects that are mediated at least partially through glutamatergic neurotransmission. Two active metabolites of ketamine, (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine (HNK) and (2S,6S)-HNK, also appear to play a key role in ketamine's rapid antidepressant effects through the activation of a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) glutamate receptors. In the present study, we demonstrated that estrogen plus ketamine or estrogen plus active ketamine metabolites displayed additive effects on the induction of the expression of AMPA receptor subunits. In parallel, the expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) was also significantly upregulated. Even more striking, radioligand binding assays demonstrated that [H-3]-ketamine can directly bind to ER alpha (K-D: 344.5 +/- 13 nM). Furthermore, ketamine and its (2R,6R)-HNK and (2S,6S)-HNK metabolites displayed similar affinity for ER alpha (IC50: 2.31 +/- 0.1, 3.40 +/- 0.2, and 3.53 +/- 0.2 nM, respectively) as determined by [H-3]-ketamine displacement assays. Finally, induction of AMPA receptors by either estrogens or ketamine and its metabolites was lost when ER alpha was knocked down or silenced pharmacologically. These results suggest a positive feedback loop by which estrogens can augment the effects of ketamine and its (2R,6R)-HNK and (2S,6S)-HNK metabolites on the ER alpha-induced transcription of CYP2A6 and CYP2B6, estrogen inducible enzymes that catalyze ketamine's biotransformation to form the two active metabolites. These observations provide novel insight into ketamine's molecular mechanism(s) of action and have potential implications for the treatment of MDD.

Although suggested to be implicated in seizure management, the exact functional importance of BGT1 in the brain is still elusive. This is partly owing to the lack of potent and selective pharmacological tool compounds that can be used to probe its function. We previously reported the identification of 2-amino-1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidine-5-car-boxylic acid (ATPCA), a selective substrate for BGT1 over GAT1/GAT3, but also an agonist for GABA(A) receptors. With the aim of providing new functional insight into BGT1, we here present the synthesis and pharmacological characterization of the tritiated analogue, [H-3]ATPCA. Using traditional uptake assays at recombinant transporters expressed in cell lines, [H-3]ATPCA displayed a striking selectivity for BGT1 among the four GATs (K-m and V-max values of 21 mu M and 3.6 nmol ATPCA/(min x mg protein), respectively), but was also found to be a substrate for the creatine transporter (CreaT). In experiments with mouse cortical cell cultures, we observed a Na+-dependent [H-3]ATPCA uptake in neurons, but not in astrocytes. The neuronal uptake could be inhibited by GABA, ATPCA, and a noncompetitive BGTI-selective inhibitor, indicating functional BGT1 in neurons. In conclusion, we report [H-3]ATPCA as a novel radioactive substrate for both BGT1 and CreaT. The dual activity of the radioligand makes it most suitable for use in recombinant studies.

While these drugs alleviate positive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia, they are less effective for treating cognitive deficits and negative symptoms. Dopamine D-3 receptors are highly expressed in areas of the brain thought to play a role in the regulation of motivation and reward-related behavior. Consequently, the dopamine D-3 receptor has become a target for treating negative symptoms in combination with D-2 antagonism to treat positive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. The purpose of this study was to determine the cariprazine receptor occupancies in brain for D-2 and D-3 receptors in patients with schizophrenia. Using [C-11]-(+)-PHNO as a radioligand, positron emission tomography (PET) scans were performed in eight patients at baseline and postdose on days 1, 4, and 15. Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were analyzed for cariprazine concentrations. A monotonic dose-occupancy relationship was observed for both receptor types. After 2 weeks of treatment, near complete (similar to 100 %) occupancies were observed for both receptors at a dose of 12 mg/day. At the lowest cariprazine dose (1 mg/day), mean D-3 and D-2 receptor occupancies were 76 and 45 %, respectively, suggesting selectivity for D-3 over D-2 receptors at low doses. An exposure-response analysis found a similar to 3-fold difference in EC50 (D-3 = 3.84 nM and D-2 = 13.03 nM) in plasma after 2 weeks of dosing. This PET imaging study in patients with schizophrenia demonstrated that cariprazine is a D-3-preferring dual D-3/D-2 receptor partial agonist.

The effects of beta-arrestin1 deletion on acute cannabinoid activity, brain cannabinoid receptors and tolerance to cannabinoids in mice	JOURNAL OF RECEPTORS AND SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION			English	Article						antinociception; CP55940; delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol; G-protein; knock-out	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; RAT-BRAIN; CROSS-TOLERANCE; KNOCKOUT MICE; MOUSE-BRAIN; BINDING; DELTA-9-TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL; DESENSITIZATION; ACTIVATION; DELTA(9)-TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL	Context: Previous studies have indicated a role for beta-arrestin2 in the regulation of brain cannabinoid effects and cannabinoid CB1 receptors, but whether beta-arrestin1 has a role has not been investigated. Objective: To determine the role of beta-arrestin1 in cannabinoid activity. Materials and methods: Beta-arrestin1 -/- mice and their wild-type (+/+) counterparts were assayed for antinociceptive and temperature-decreasing effects of two ligands, Delta(9) -tetrahydro-cannabinol (THC) and CP55940, after both single and repeated administration. In vitro assays examined the effects of deletion on CB1 receptor density, agonist-binding and G-protein activation. Results: Deletion of beta-arrestin1 diminished the effects of CP55940 in both antinociception (latency to tail withdrawal) and temperature-depression assays in mice. However, deleting beta-arrestin1 had no effect on the actions of THC in either assay. Antagonist radioligand ([H-3]SR141716A) saturation binding indicated no difference between beta-arrestin1 +/+ and -/- mice in the density or affinity for cannabinoid CB1 receptors in brain membranes. CP55940 agonist binding in brain membranes from beta-arrestin1 +/+ mice exhibited high-and intermediate-affinity sites, but beta-arrestin1 -/- membranes exhibited an additional site with low affinity. CP55940 produced greater stimulation of [S-35] GTP gamma S binding to membranes from whole brain of beta-arrestin1 -/- than +/+ mice. The rates of the development of tolerance to chronic THC or CP55940 administration did not appear to be affected by genotype. Discussion: Beta-arrestin1 appeared to mediate the actions of CP55940, but did not affect the activity of THC. Conclusion: Beta-arrestin1 regulates cannabinoid CB1 receptor sensitivity in an agonist-selective manner, but may not be the primary mediator of tolerance to cannabinoid agonists.

The aim of the study was to assess the influence of duration of zolpidem treatment and its withdrawal, as well as the role of alpha 1-containing GABA(A) receptors in the development of physical dependence and tolerance. Namely, recombinant receptors can be used to characterize mechanisms involved in different processes in the brain and to delineate the contribution of specific receptor subtypes. To address the influence of chronic zolpidem treatment we exposed HEK293 cells stably expressing alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2S recombinant GABA(A) receptors for seven consecutive days, while withdrawal periods lasted for 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours. Using radioligand binding studies we determined that chronic zolpidem treatment did not induce changes in either GABA(A) receptor number or in the expression of subunit mRNAs. We observed the enhancement of binding sites and upregulated expression of subunit mRNAs only following 96-hour withdrawal. Moreover, zolpidem treatment and its withdrawal (all time points) induced functional uncoupling between GABA and benzodiazepine binding sites in the GABA(A) receptor complex. Accordingly, it might be assumed that zolpidem withdrawal-induced uncoupling of GABA(A) receptors is associated with altered GABA(A) receptor subunit mRNA expression. The results presented here provide an insight into molecular and cellular mechanisms probably underlying adaptive changes of GABA(A) receptor function in response to chronic usage and withdrawal of zolpidem and perhaps the observed molecular changes could be linked to the tolerance and dependence produced upon prolonged treatment with other GABAergic drugs.

Pendrin and NIS antibodies are absent in healthy individuals and are rare in autoimmune thyroid disease: evidence from a Danish twin study	CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article							SODIUM-IODIDE SYMPORTER; NA+/I-SYMPORTER; BLOCKING AUTOANTIBODIES; GRAVES-DISEASE; LOW-FREQUENCY; THYROGLOBULIN; AUTOANTIGEN; BINDING; HYPOTHYROIDISM; ESTABLISHMENT	Objective Antibodies against thyroglobulin, thyroid peroxidase and the TSH receptor are accepted as pathophysiological and diagnostic biomarkers in autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD). In contrast, the prevalence, aetiology and clinical relevance of autoantibodies against the human sodium-iodine symporter (NISAb) and pendrin (PenAb) remain unclear. The objectives of the study were to investigate the presence of NISAb and PenAb in Danish twins, with and without AITD, to study whether the published variations in NISAb and PenAb frequencies were related to differences in methodology or study populations, and to evaluate whether the presence of NISAb or PenAb most likely results from genetic or nongenetic factors. Methods Sera from 93 patients with AITD and 230 healthy controls were evaluated for NISAb and PenAb using radioligand binding assays (RBA). Results Patients with AITD had a higher prevalence than the controls: NISAb: 17% vs 0% (P < 0.001) and PenAb: 11% vs 0% (P < 0.001). Subdividing according to cause of AITD yielded similar results: 20% (11/56) of patients with Graves' disease (GD) and 14% (5/37) of patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) had NISAb, (P < 0.05, vs control population). Seven of 56 (13%) patients with GD and three of 37 (8%) patients with HT had PenAb (P < 0.05 vs control population). No twin pairs were concordant for NISAb or PenAb, not even among twin pairs concordant for AITD. Conclusions In accord with studies using the same RBAs, the frequency of NISAb and PenAb was low in Danish patients with AITD and absent in healthy individuals, suggesting that differences between studies rely on assay differences. The skewed distribution of NISAb and PenAb within AITD concordant twin pairs suggests that NISAb and PenAb are likely attributable to the effects of environmental factors acting in genetic susceptible individuals.

A Selective Sigma-2 Receptor Ligand Antagonizes Cocaine-Induced Hyperlocomotion in Mice	SYNAPSE			English	Article						motor activity; behavior; substance abuse; psychostimulant	DELTA-OPIOID-RECEPTORS; ACID ISOPROPYL ESTER; IN-VIVO; DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER; PHARMACOLOGICAL EVALUATION; SUBSTITUTED PIPERAZINE; INDUCED HYPERACTIVITY; BENZAMIDE ANALOGS; AFFINITY; BINDING	Cocaine functions, in part, through agonist actions at sigma-1 (sigma(1)) receptors, while roles played by sigma-2 (sigma(2)) receptors are less established. Attempts to discriminate sigma(2) receptor-mediated effects of cocaine in locomotor hyperactivity assays have been hampered by the lack of potent and selective antagonists. Certain tetrahydroisoquinolinyl benzamides display high sigma(2) receptor affinity, and excellent selectivity for binding to sigma(2) over sigma(1) receptors. The behavioral properties of this structural class of sigma ligands have not yet been investigated. The present study evaluated 5-bromo-N-[4-(6,7-dimethoxy-3,4-dihydro-1H-isoquinolin-2-yl)-butyl)]-2,3-dimethoxy-benzamide, 1, a ligand shown by others to bind preferentially to sigma(2) over sigma(1) receptors, as well as dopamine D-2 and D-3 sites. First, we determined binding to monoamine transporters and opioid receptors, and noted 57-fold selectivity for sigma(2) receptors over the serotonin transporter, and >800-fold selectivity for sigma(2) receptors over the other sites tested. We then examined 1 in locomotor activity studies using male CD-1 (R) mice, and saw no alteration of basal activity at doses up to 31.6 mu mol/kg. Cocaine produced a fivefold increase in locomotor activity, which was attenuated by 66% upon pretreatment of mice with 1 at 31.6 mu mol/kg. In vivo radioligand binding studies also were performed, and showed no occupancy of sigma(1) receptors or the dopamine transporter by 1, or its possible metabolites, at the 31.6 mu mol/kg dose. Thus, ligand 1 profiles behaviorally as a sigma(2) receptor-selective antagonist that is able to counteract cocaine's motor stimulatory effects. Synapse 68:73-84, 2014.

This study used statistical imaging analysis for IMZ-SPECT to investigate the relationship between higher brain dysfunction and cortical neuron loss in the medial frontal lobes, to establish a confirmatory diagnosis of higher brain dysfunction in patients with adult moyamoya disease. IMZ-SPECT was estimated by three-dimensional stereotactic surface projections (3D-SSP). Cortical neuron loss was analyzed using the stereotactic extraction estimation (SEE) method (level 3: gyrus level) for 3D-SSP Z-score maps (Z-score >2). Extent of pixels with significant reduction of BZ receptor density within the target gyri (i.e. bilateral medial frontal gyri [MFGs] and anterior cingulate gyri [ACGs]) was calculated. In 6 patients with higher brain dysfunction, significant cortical neuron loss was observed in the bilateral MFGs in 4 patients, unilateral MFG in 1 patient, and bilateral ACGs in 2 patients. In 12 patients without higher brain dysfunction, no significant cortical neuron loss was observed in the bilateral MFGs or ACGs, and mild loss was observed in the bilateral MFGs in 2 patients, unilateral MFG in 4 patients, and unilateral ACG in 2 patients. Long-standing mild hemodynamic ischemia in the anterior circulation of patients with adult moyamoya disease could lead to incomplete brain infarction within the medial frontal lobes. Statistical imaging analysis using 3D-SSP and SEE methods for IMZ-SPECT could demonstrate significant cortical neuron loss in the bilateral frontal medial cortices involving MFG and/or ACG which correlate with higher brain dysfunction in patients. with adult moyamoya disease.

Dynamic PET recordings were made in isoflurane-anaesthetized juvenile pigs during 120 min after administration of [F-18]NS10743 under baseline conditions (n = 3) and after blocking of the alpha 7 nAChR with NS6740 (3 mg center dot kg(-1) bolus + 1 mg center dot kg(-1)center dot h(-1) continuous infusion; n = 3). Arterial plasma samples were collected for determining the input function of the unmetabolized tracer. Kinetic analysis of regional brain time-radioactivity curves was performed, and parametric maps were calculated relative to arterial input. Plasma [F-18]NS10743 passed readily into the brain, with peak uptake occurring in alpha 7 nAChR-expressing brain regions such as the colliculi, thalamus, temporal lobe and hippocampus. The highest SUVmax was approximately 2.3, whereas the lowest uptake was in the olfactory bulb (SUVmax 1.53 +/- 0.32). Administration of NS6740 significantly decreased [F-18]NS10743 binding late in the emission recording throughout the brain, except in the olfactory bulb, which was therefore chosen as reference region for calculation of BPND. The baseline BPND ranged from 0.39 +/- 0.08 in the cerebellum to 0.76 +/- 0.07 in the temporal lobe. Pretreatment and constant infusion with NS6740 significantly reduced the BPND in regions with high [F-18]NS10743 binding (temporal lobe -29%, p = 0.01; midbrain: -35%, p = 0.02), without significantly altering the BPND in low binding regions (cerebellum: -16%, p = 0.2). This study confirms the potential of [F-18]NS10743 as a target-specific radiotracer for the molecular imaging of central alpha 7 nAChRs by PET.

Pharmacological Characterization of FE 202158, a Novel, Potent, Selective, and Short-Acting Peptidic Vasopressin V<sub>1a</sub> Receptor Full Agonist for the Treatment of Vasodilatory Hypotension	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							SEPTIC SHOCK; WATER CLEARANCE; RADIAL ARTERY; NITRIC-OXIDE; RESPONSES; F-180; TERLIPRESSIN; ANTAGONISTS; PHYSIOLOGY; SEPSIS	FE 202158, ([Phe(2), Ile(3), Hgn(4), Orn(iPr)(8)]vasopressin, where Hgn is homoglutamine and iPr is isopropyl), a peptidic analog of the vasoconstrictor hormone [Arg(8)]vasopressin (AVP), was designed to be a potent, selective, and short-acting vasopressin type 1a receptor (V1aR) agonist. In functional reporter gene assays, FE 202158 was a potent and selective human V1aR agonist [EC50 = 2.4 nM; selectivity ratio of 1:142:1107:440 versus human vasopressin type 1b receptor, vasopressin type 2 receptor (V-2R), and oxytocin receptor, respectively] contrasting with AVP's lack of selectivity, especially versus the V 2 R (selectivity ratio of 1:18:0.2:92; human V1aR EC50 = 0.24 nM). This activity and selectivity profile was confirmed in radioligand binding assays. FE 202158 was a potent vasoconstrictor in the isolated rat common iliac artery ex vivo (EC50 = 3.6 nM versus 0.8 nM for AVP) and reduced rat ear skin blood flow after intravenous infusion in vivo (ED50 = 4.0 versus 3.4 pmol/kg/min for AVP). The duration of its vasopressor effect by intravenous bolus in rats was as short as AVP at submaximally effective doses. FE 202158 had no V2R-mediated antidiuretic activity in rats by intravenous infusion at its ED50 for reduction of ear skin blood flow, in contrast with the pronounced antidiuretic effect of AVP. Thus, FE 202158 seems suitable for treatment of conditions where V1aR activity is desirable but V-2R activity is potentially deleterious, such as vasodilatory hypotension in septic shock. In addition to the desirable selectivity profile, its short-acting nature should allow dose titration with rapid onset and offset of action to optimize vasoconstriction efficacy and safety.

Radiolabeled GRPR-targeting analogs of bombesin (BN) have successfully been introduced as potential tracers for visualization and treatment of GRPR-overexpressing tumors. A previous study showed GRPR-mediated binding of radiolabeled BN analogs in androgen-dependent but not in androgen-independent xenografts representing the more advanced stages of PC. We have further investigated the effect of androgen modulation on GRPR-expression in three androgen-dependent human PC-bearing xenografts: PC295, PC310 and PC82 using the androgen-independent PC3-model as a reference. Effects of androgen regulation on GRPR expression were initially studied on tumors obtained from our biorepository of xenograft tissues performing reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and autoradiography ((125)I-universal-BN). A prospective biodistribution study ((111)In-MP2653) and subsequent autoradiography ((125)I-GRP and (111)In-MP2248) was than performed in castrated and testosterone resupplemented tumor-bearing mice. For all androgen-dependent xenografts, tumor uptake and binding decreased drastically after 7 days of castration. Resupplementation of testosterone to castrated animals restored GRPR expression extensively. Similar findings were concluded from the initial autoradiography and RT-PCR studies. Results from RT-PCR, for which human specific primers are used, indicate that variations in GRPR expression can be ascribed to mRNA downregutation and not to castration-induced reduction in the epithelial fraction of the xenograft tumor tissue. In conclusion, expression of human GRPR in androgen-dependent PC xenografts is reduced by androgen ablation and is reversed by restoring the hormonal status of the animals. This knowledge suggests that hormonal therapy may affect GRPR expression in PC tissue making GRPR-based imaging and therapy especially suitable for non-hormonally treated PC patients.

Carbon-11 labeled papaverine as a PET tracer for imaging PDE10A: radiosynthesis, in vitro and in vivo evaluation	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						PDE10A; PET; Radiotracer; CNS; Phosphodiesterase 10A; C-11; Papaverine	STRIATUM-ENRICHED PHOSPHODIESTERASE; IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL LOCALIZATION; RAT; METABOLISM; INHIBITORS	Papaverine, 1-(3,4-dimethoxybenzyl)-6,7-dimethoxyisoquinoline, a specific inhibitor of phosphodiesterase (PDE) 10A with IC(50) values of 36 nM for PDE10A, 1,300 nM for PDE3A and 320 nM for PDE4D, has served as a useful pharmaceutical tool to study the physiological role of PDE10A. Here, we report the radiosynthesis of [(11)C]papaverine and the in vitro and in vivo evaluation of [(11)C]papaverine as a potential positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer for imaging PDE10A in the central nervous system (CNS). The radiosynthesis of papaverine with (11)C was achieved by O-methylation of the corresponding des-methyl precursor with [(11)C]methyl iodide. [(11)C]papaverine was obtained with similar to 70% radiochemical yield and a specific activity >10 Ci/mu mol. In vitro autoradiography studies of rat and monkey brain sections revealed selective binding of [(11)C]papaverine to PDE10A enriched regions: the striatum of rat brain and the caudate and putamen of rhesus monkey brain. The biodistribution of [(11)C]papaverine in rats at 5 min demonstrated an initially higher accumulation in striatum than in other brain regions, however the washout was rapid. MicroPET imaging studies in rhesus macaques similarly displayed initial specific uptake in the striatum with very rapid clearance of [(11)C]papaverine from brain. Our initial evaluation suggests that despite papaverine's utility for in vitro studies and as a pharmaceutical tool, [(11)C]papaverine is not an ideal radioligand for clinical imaging of PDE 10A in the CNS. Analogs of papaverine having a higher potency for inhibiting PDE10A and improved pharmacokinetic properties will be necessary for imaging this enzyme with PET. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Pro-inflammatory responses in human monocytes are β<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor subtype dependent	MOLECULAR IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						beta-Adrenergic receptors; Interleukin-1 beta; Monocytes; Receptor signaling; Catecholamines	BETA-ADRENERGIC-RECEPTOR; TUMOR-NECROSIS-FACTOR; BETA(2)-ADRENERGIC RECEPTOR; CARDIAC MYOCYTES; CELLS; ACTIVATION; STIMULATION; MACROPHAGES; SYSTEM; PHARMACOLOGY	Stress induced circulating catecholamines are hypothesized to selectively activate adrenergic receptors (ARs) on immunocompetent cells modulating their inflammatory response to trauma or environmental toxins. We characterized changes in expression of a pro-inflammatory cytokine modulated by beta-AR activation in human primary and immortalized monocytes that had been simultaneously stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Results from cytokine antibody arrays demonstrated that half-maximal effective concentrations of the selective beta-AR agonist isoproterenol (Iso) qualitatively increased LPS-mediated expression of the soluble cytokine, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta). Semi-quantitative immunoblot techniques confirmed a synergistic increase of IL-1 beta production in both LPS stimulated THP-1 cells and primary human monocytes co-incubated with Iso. Immunoblot techniques as well as radioligand binding studies were also used to characterize the heterogeneous expression of beta(1)- and beta(2)-AR subtypes on THP-1 cells. beta-AR activation is classically associated with generation of cAMP in many tissues and cell types. Therefore, using the method of Schild, we generated Iso concentration-response curves in the presence of fixed subtype-selective beta-AR antagonist concentrations to demonstrate that beta(1)-AR activation was exclusively linked with the generation of cAMP in THP-1 cells. Furthermore, use of a selective kinase inhibitor demonstrated that Is potentiated the expression of soluble IL-1 beta through activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A. Finally, discriminating concentrations of subtype-selective beta-AR antagonists revealed that beta(1)-AR stimulation alone accounted for the synergistic production of IL-1 beta in LPS stimulated monocytes co-incubated with Is. These results demonstrate a unique synergistic pro-inflammatory response mediated through a beta(1)-AR cAMP-dependent mechanism in LPS-challenged monocytic cells. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Human biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of <SUP>11</SUP>C-(R)-PK11195, the prototypic PET ligand to image inflammation	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						Positron emission tomography; C-11-(R)-PK11195; Translocator protein 18 kDa	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; WHOLE-BODY PET; PROTEIN 18 KDA; PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN; HEALTHY-VOLUNTEERS; 2-DIMENSIONAL PLANAR; HUMAN BRAIN; RADIOLIGAND; MICROGLIA	The positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer C-11-(R)-PK11195 allows the in vivo imaging in humans of the translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO), previously called peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), a marker of inflammation. Despite its widespread use, the radiation burden associated with C-11-(R)-PK11195 in humans is not known. To examine this, we performed dynamic whole-body imaging with PET and C-11-(R)-PK11195 in healthy humans. Five healthy male volunteers were scanned with PET and C-11-(R)-PK11195, using a dynamic whole-body imaging protocol. An organ-specific method was used to measure accumulated radioactivity in source organs, and residence times were calculated as areas under the curve of time-activity curves expressed as percentage of injected radioactivity. Residence times were used as input for OLINDA/EXM 1.0 software to model the equivalent organ doses and the effective dose for the 70-kg man. After intravenous injection of C-11-(R)-PK11195, radioactivity accumulated in organs rich in TSPO as well as routes of excretion: the hepatobiliary system and the urine. The mean effective dose was 4.8 A mu Sv/MBq according to International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) Publication 60 and 5.1 A mu Sv/MBq according to ICRP Publication 103, and the highest equivalent organ doses were observed in the kidneys (14.0 A mu Sv/MBq), spleen (12.5 A mu Sv/MBq) and small intestine (12.2 A mu Sv/MBq). Imaging of TSPO with PET using C-11-(R)-PK11195 is associated with modest radiation exposure, similar in magnitude to most other C-11-labelled PET tracers, suggesting feasibility of C-11-(R)-PK11195 imaging in clinical human studies involving multiple scans in the same subjects per year.

However, to date, studies of drug-induced and tonic dopamine release have not been performed in the same subjects. This study performed positron emission tomography (PET) with [F-18]fallypride in healthy subjects to assess (1) the reproducibility of [F-18]fallypride and (2) both D-amphetamine-induced and (X-methyl-p-tyrosine (AMPT)-induced changes in dopamin release on [F-18]fallypride binding in striatal and extrastriatal areas. Subjects underwent [F-18]fallypride PET studies at baseline and following oral D-amphetamine administration (0.5 mg/kg) and oral AMPT administration (3 g/70 kg/day over 44 h). Binding potential (BP) (BPND) of [F-18]fallypride was calculated in striatal and extrastriatal areas using a reference region method. Percent change in regional BPND was computed and correlated with change in cognition and mood. Test-retest variability of [F-18]fallypride was low in both striatal and extrastriatal regions. D-Amphetamine significantly decreased BPND by 8-14% in striatal subdivisions, caudate, putamen, substantia nigra, medial orbitofrontal cortex, and medial temporal cortex. Correlation between change in BPND and verbal fluency was seen in the thalamus and substantia nigra. In contrast, depletion of endogenous dopamine with AMPT did not effect [F-18]fallypride BPND in both striatum and extrastriatal regions. These findings indicate that [F-18]fallypride is useful for measuring amphetamine-induced dopamine release, but may be unreliable for estimating tonic dopamine levels, in striatum and extrastriatal regions of healthy humans.

The natural agonists atrial and brain natriuretic peptides (ANP, BNP) bind and activate NPRA, leading to cyclic GMP production, which is responsible for their role in cardiovascular homeostasis. Previous studies suggested that stabilization of a dimeric form of NPRA by agonist is essential for receptor activation. However, ligand specificity and sequential steps of this dimerization process have not been investigated. We used radioligand binding, fluorescence resonance energy transfer homoquenching, and molecular modeling to characterize the interaction of human NPRA-ECD with ANP, BNP, the superagonist (Arg(10), Leu(12), Ser(17), Leu(18))-rANP-(1-28), the minimized analog mini-ANP and the antagonist (Arg(6), beta-cyclohexyl-Ala(8), D-Tic(16), Arg(17), Cys(18))-rANP-(6-18)-amide (A71915). ANP binds to preformed ECD dimers and spontaneous dimerization is the rate-limiting step of the ligand binding process. All the studied peptides, including A71915 antagonist, induce a dose-dependent fluorescence homoquenching, specific to dimerization, with potencies highly correlated with their binding affinities. A71915 induced more quenching than other peptides, suggesting stabilization by the antagonist of ECD dimer in a distinct inactive conformation. In summary, these results indicate that the ligand-induced dimerization process of NPRA is different from that for cytokine receptor model. Agonists or antagonists bind to preformed dimeric ECD, leading to dimer stabilization in an active or inactive conformation, respectively. Furthermore, the highly sensitive fluorescence assay designed to assess dimerization could serve as a powerful tool for further detailing the kinetic steps involved in natriuretic peptide receptor binding and activation.

J	Francis, GD; Dimech, M; Giles, L; Hopkins, A				Francis, Glenn D.; Dimech, Margaret; Giles, Leanne; Hopkins, Alison			Frequency and reliability of oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2 in breast carcinoma determined by immunohistochemistry in Australasia: results of the RCPA Quality Assurance Program	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PATHOLOGY			English	Article							HER-2/NEU; EXPRESSION; CANCER; SENSITIVITY; ASSOCIATION; ONCOGENE; IMPACT; WOMEN; AGE	Background and Aims: Immunohistochemistry ( IHC) has replaced radioligand binding assay for the determination of oestrogen receptor ( ER) status in breast carcinoma. IHC is also used for assessment of progesterone receptor ( PR) and HER2. The Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia ( RCPA) Quality Assurance Program ( QAP) introduced a breast markers module in 2003 to evaluate the performance of laboratories with IHC for ER, PR and HER2. Methods: An audit of laboratories reporting breast carcinomas was performed in 2005 and 2006 to evaluate in- house results. Laboratories were asked to submit the hormone receptor and HER2 status on each invasive breast carcinoma for the previous 6 month period up to a maximum of 100 cases. The time periods were 1 July 2004 to 31 December 2004, and 1 July 2005 to 31 December 2005. A total of 55 laboratories returned information for 2004 and 67 for 2005. Results: Complete data on 8128 patients was returned for both surveys, 3353 cases for 2004 and 4775 for 2005. The results were similar for both surveys. Of the 8128 cases, 59.0% were ER+/ PR+, 15.9% ER+/ PR2, 2.4% ER2/ PR+ and 22.7% ER2/ PR2. HER2 data were submitted for a total of 6512 patients ( excludes 52 patients with incomplete data sets); 17.1% were reported as 3+ positive on IHC, 12.5% as 2+ and 70.4% as negative. Conclusions: A laboratory audit was introduced into the RCPA QAP for breast markers due to concerns raised by participating laboratories about technical differences in supplied tissues for testing. This audit indicates that overall the results for ER, PR and HER2 fall inside established parameters. However, a number of individual laboratories do not meet the target values and variation in results would impact on patient treatment decisions.

Previous studies support the existence of a bulimia-related endophenotype as well as disturbances in serotonin (5-HT) transmission. We studied serotonin transporter (SERT) binding in BN, and to investigate the possibility of a SERT-related endophenotype for BN, did this in a sample of female twins. We hypothesized clearly reduced SERT binding in BN women as opposed to healthy women, and intermediate SERT binding in unaffected co-twins. Methods: We studied 13 female twins with BN (9 with purging and 4 with non-purging BN) and 25 healthy women, including 6 healthy twin sisters of BN patients and 19 women from 10 healthy twin pairs. [I-123n]ADAM, a selective SERT radioligand for single photon emission tomography (SPET) imaging, was used to assess SERT availability in the midbrain and the thalamus. Results: No differences in SERT binding were evident when comparing the BN women, their unaffected co-twins and the healthy controls (p = 0.14). The healthy sisters of the BN patients and the healthy control women had similar SERT binding in both brain regions. In a post hoc subgroup analysis, the purging bulimics had higher SERT binding than the healthy women in the midbrain (p = 0.03), but not in the thalamus. Conclusion: Our finding of increased SERT binding in the midbrain in the purging BN women raises the possibility that this subgroup of bulimics might differ in serotonergic function from the non-purging ones. The similarity of the unaffected co-twins and the healthy controls doesn't support our initial assumption of a SERT-related endophenotype for BN. Due to the small sample size, our results need to be interpreted with caution and verified in a larger sample.

It may also be applicable for measuring the effectiveness of therapeutic drugs aimed at lowering A beta plaques in the brain. We have successfully reported a series of F-18-labeled fluoropegylated stilbenes for PET imaging studies. Encouraging results clearly demonstrated the usefulness of 18F-labeled stilbenes as potential A beta plaque-imaging agents. In the present study, we applied a similar approach to a styrylpyridine backbone structure. Among all derivatives examined, (E)-2-(2-(2-(2-fluoroethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)-5(4-dimethylaminostyryl)-pyridine (2) displayed high binding affinity in postmortem AD brain homogenates (K-i =2.5 +/- 0.4 nM, with [I-125]IMPY as radioligand). No-carrier-added [F-18]2 was successfully prepared by [F-18]fluoride displacement of the corresponding tosylate precursor with a high labeling yield (30-40%) and a high radiochemical purity (> 99%). Specific activity at the end of synthesis was determined to be 1500-2000 Ci/mmol. The tracer [F-18]2 showed adequate lipophilicity (log P=3.22). In vivo biodistribution of [F-18]2 in normal mice exhibited excellent initial brain penetration and rapid washout (7.77% and 1.03% dose/g in the brain at 2 and 30 min after intravenous injection, respectively) properties that are highly desirable for A beta-plaque-specific brain imaging agents. Autoradiography of AD brain sections and homogenate binding with postmortem AD brain tissues confirmed the high binding signal of [F-18]2 due to the presence of A beta plaques. These prelin-linary results suggest that novel PET tracers may be potentially useful for the imaging of A beta plaques in the living human brain. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Molecules with high affinity to its intracellular tyrosine kinase domain are being developed as in vivo imaging probes. The 4-anilinoquinazoline PD153035 has promising in vitro and in vivo properties for development as a reversible radioligand. Labeling it with carbon-11 in either of its two methoxy positions can potentially give rise to different radiometabolites and, consequently, different imaging capabilities. An evaluation of the radiotracers' metabolism was needed to determine the potential significance of the labeling position. Methods: PD153035 was labeled in the 6- and 7-O-methoxy positions by reacting the corresponding O-desmethyl precursors with [C-11]methyl iodide. The two radiolabeled compounds were each incubated for 1 h with human and rat liver microsomes. At five time points, the radiolabeled metabolites were examined using radio-liquid chromatography. One metabolite was isolated and subjected to mass spectroscopic analysis. Results: A major polar metabolite was obtained in all incubations. Its molecular weight was consistent with an addition of oxygen, and its fragmentation was consistent with an N-oxidation rather than an aromatic hydroxylation. Regioselective 7-O-dealkylation was also observed, albeit in substantial amounts only in the assay using human microsomes. Conclusions: Radiolabeling in the 7-O-methoxy position is advocated, since the labeled metabolites produced in the 7-O-demethylation are polar and probably rapidly cleared. The differences observed in the incubations with rat and human microsomes suggest that in vivo positron emission tomography studies with C-11-labeled PD153035 in rodents may not be directly predictive for studies in humans.

In order to augment our knowledge regarding the interactions between cannabinoid receptors (CBs) and their ligands, efficient and effective tools are essential for robust expression and purification of these membrane-bound proteins. In this report, we describe a suitable method for purification of the human cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) to a qualitative and quantitative level sufficient for mass spectral analysis. We utilized a baculovirus expression system, incorporating several epitope tags to facilitate purification and to ameliorate the effect the tags have on CB2 expression and function. Expressed protein encoded by a carboxy (C)-terminal His-tagged CB2 construct displayed a B-max value of 9.3 pmol/mg with a K-D of 7.30 nm using [3(H)]CP-55(940), a standard cannabinoid radioligand, and was selected for subsequent purification experiments. Western blot analysis of purified membrane protein yielded several forms of CB2, the most abundant being a 41 kDa peptide. A second protein species was observed with an apparent molecular weight of 46 kDa representing a glycosylated form of CB2. In addition, a CB2 homodimer was also identified. The purified receptor was subjected to mass spectroscopic analysis to confirm its identity and purity. Mass spectra corresponding to the intracellular, extracellular and transmembrane domains were obtained. These experiments exemplify the importance of high-level expression systems when developing membrane-bound protein purification strategies. This work will aid in the identification of receptor-ligand binding sites, the characterization of molecular features involved in receptor activation, and the elucidation of the CB2 receptor tertiary structure.

[F-18]Repaglinide could be obtained in an overall radiochemical yield (RCY) of 20% after 135 min with a radiochemical purity higher than 98% applying the secondary labeling precursor 2-[F-18]fluoroethyltosylate. Specific activity was in the range of 50-60 GBq/mumol. Labeling was conducted by exchanging the ethoxy-moiety into a 2-[F-18]fluoroethoxy group. To characterize the properties of fluorinated repaglinide, the affinity of the analogous non-radioactive F-19-compound for binding to the human SUR 1 isoform was assessed. [F-19]Repaglinide induced a complete monophasic inhibition curve with a Hill coefficient close to 1 (1.03) yielding a dissociation constant (K-D) of 134 nM. Biological activity was proven via insulin secretion experiments on isolated rat islets and was comparable to that of repaglinide. Finally, biodistribution of [F-18]repaglinide was investigated in rats by measuring the concentration of the compound in different organs after i.v. injection. Pancreatic tissue displayed a stable accumulation of approximate to0.12% of the injected dose from 10 min to 30 min p.i.. 50% of the radioactive tracer could be displaced by additional injection of unlabeled repaglinide, indicating that [F-18]repaglinide might be suitable for in vivo investigation with PET.

To expand the knowledge about the role of ACh in oral biology, we investigated the presence of the muscarinic ACh receptor (mAChR) subtypes in GKC. RT-PCR demonstrated the presence of m2, m3, m4, and m5 mRNA transcripts. Synthesis of the respective proteins was verified by immunoblotting with the subtype-specific antibodies that revealed receptor bands at the expected molecular weights. The antibodies mapped mAChR subtypes in the epithelium of human attached gingiva and also visualized them on the cell membrane of cultured GKC. The whole cell radioligand binding assay revealed that GKC have specific binding sites for the muscarinic ligand [H-3]quinuclidinyl benzilate, B-max = 222.9 fmol/10(6) cells with a K-d of 62.95 pM. The downstream coupling of the mAChRs to regulation of cell cycle progression in GKC was studied using quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblotting assays. Incubation of GKC for 24 h with 10 muM muscarine increased relative amounts of Ki-67, PCNA and p53 mRNAs and PCNA, cyclin D1, p21 and p53 proteins. These elects were abolished in the presence of 50 muM atropine. The finding in GKC of mAChRs coupled to regulation of the cell cycle progression demonstrate further the structure/function of the non-neuronal cholinergic system operating in human oral epithelium. The results obtained in this study help clarify the role for keratinocyte ACh axis in the physiologic control of oral gingival homeostasis.

The aim of this study was to improve the detection of anti-tRNP((Ser)Sec)/ SLA by establishing an immunoassay that was able to identify antibodies directed to conformational epitopes and to investigate the clinical implication of this autoantibody in autoimmune liver disease. By using eukaryotically expressed tRNP (Ser)Sec/SLA as target in a radioligand assay (RLA), 81 patients with autoimmune liver disease (AILD) (33 type I AIH, 31 type 2 AIH, and 17 autoimmune sclerosing cholantitis [ASC]), 147 pathologic, and 56 healthy controls were investigated. RLA results were compared with those obtained using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblot. Reactivity to tRNp((Ser)Sec)/SLA Was present in 58% of patients with type I and type 2 AIH, 41% with ASC, but in only 3 pathologic controls. RLA was similarly disease-specific but remarkably more sensitive than ELISA and immanoblot. A prospective study showed that anti-tRNP((Ser)Sec)/ SI-A-positive patients run a severe clinical course, having worse histology, needing longer to achieve remission, relapsing and requiring liver transplantation or dying more frequently than anti-tRNp((Ser)Sec)/SLA negative patients. Anti-tRNP((Ser)sec)/SLA production was favored by the possession of DR3 and A1-B8-DR3 in AIH type 1 and ASC, and prevented by the possession of A2 in all 3 types of AILD, particularly in type 2 AIH. In conclusion, anticon-formational tRNP((Ser)sec)/SLA reactivity is frequent in type I and type 2 AIH and ASC, defining patients with a worse prognosis.

J	Hayashi, T; Uchida, K; Kawamoto, K				Hayashi, T; Uchida, K; Kawamoto, K			Basic properties and annual changes of follicle-stimulating hormone receptors in the testis of horseshoe bats, <i>Rhinolophus ferrumequinum</i>	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY			English	Article							ANNUAL REPRODUCTIVE-CYCLE; PLASMA TESTOSTERONE CONCENTRATIONS; TESTICULAR GONADOTROPIN RECEPTORS; MALE DJUNGARIAN HAMSTER; CULTURED SERTOLI CELLS; LONG-FINGERED BAT; RAT TESTIS; PHODOPUS-SUNGORUS; SEASONAL-CHANGES; FSH RECEPTOR	The unique reproductive patterns, delayed fertilization in females, and asynchrony between spermatogenesis and mating behavior in males are well documented in bats living in temperate latitudes. The present study was undertaken to examine follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) receptors in the testis of bats, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, during the annual reproductive cycle. Male bats were captured at natural roosting sites and testicular preparations were subjected to a radioligand binding assay for FSH receptors. The weight of paired testes increased considerably in the spermatogenic period and decreased from the mating to hibernation periods. Meiotic division in the testis was observed in the spermatogenic period but not the mating period. Serum testosterone concentrations increased in the spermatogenic period and rapidly decreased in the mating period. The binding of FSH was specific for mammalian FSHs and detected primarily in the testis. Scatchard plot analyses of the binding of FSH to bat testicular preparations showed straight lines, suggesting the presence of a single class of binding sites. The affinities (equilibrium association constant) of FSH receptors were consistent throughout the annual reproductive cycle. The specific binding per unit weight of testis and total binding in the paired testes were highest in the mating period and in the spermatogenic period, respectively, among reproductive periods. The accumulation of cyclic adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate to FSH stimulation was higher in the spermatogenic period than in the hibernation period. These findings suggest that testicular function of bats is associated with seasonal changes in the number of binding sites, while the number per target cell and the activation of adenylate cyclase led by FSH-receptor complex considerably decreases in the hibernation period.

Effects on M, receptor were assessed functionally by a microphysiometer apparatus, while M-2, M-3, and M-4 receptor potency and affinity were studied on isolated preparations of guinea pig heart, ileum, and lung, respectively. The results suggest that the substitution of a hydrogen with a long side-chain or bulky group generally induces a decrease in potency at M, and M-3 subtypes, while a general increase in this parameter is obtained at M-2 subtype. Among the agonists 2-18, compound 4 behaves as a full agonist with a preference for M-3 subtype. Moreover, compound 12 is inactive at M-1 and M-4 receptors while it displays a full agonist activity at M-2 and M-3 subtypes. Since demox displays a variable response on cardiac M-2 receptors regulating heart force, an in-depth inquiry of the functional behaviour of this compound was carried out at M-2 receptors. In presence of 10(-11) and 10(-10) M demox, the binding of [H-3]-NMS was increased by approximate to 30% as a consequence of an increase of the association of [H-3]-NMS to membranes-, this effect was not observed in presence of a higher concentration of [H-3]-NMS. Higher concentrations of demox decreased the binding of [H-3]-NMS to heart atrial membranes but significantly retarded the dissociation of this radioligand. Our results suggest that demox may interact with orthosteric and allosteric sites of atrial M-2 muscarinic receptor. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

Population pharmacokinetic dosimetry model using imaging data to assess variability in pharmacokinetics of <SUP>177</SUP>Lu-PSMA-617 in prostate cancer patients	CPT-PHARMACOMETRICS & SYSTEMS PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							RADIATION-DOSIMETRY; PSMA; DIAGNOSIS; THERAPY; LESSONS; TUMOR	Studies to evaluate and optimize [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA treatment focus primarily on individual patient data. A population pharmacokinetic (PK) dosimetry model was developed to explore the potential of using imaging data as input for population PK models and to characterize variability in organ and tumor uptake of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 in patients with low volume metastatic prostate cancer. Simulations were performed to identify the effect of dose adjustments on absorbed doses in salivary glands and tumors. A six-compartment population PK model was developed, consisting of blood, salivary gland, kidneys, liver, tumor, and a lumped compartment representing other tissue (compartment 1-6, respectively), based on data from 10 patients who received [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 (2 cycles, similar to 3 and similar to 6 GBq). Data consisted of radioactivity levels (decay corrected) in blood and tissues (9 blood samples and 5 single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography scans). Observations in all compartments were adequately captured by individual model predictions. Uptake into salivary glands was saturable with an estimated maximum binding capacity (B-max) of 40.4 MBq (relative standard error 12.3%) with interindividual variability (IIV) of 59.3% (percent coefficient of variation [CV%]). IIV on other PK parameters was relatively minor. Tumor volume was included as a structural effect on the tumor uptake rate constant (k(15)), where a two-fold increase in tumor volume resulted in a 1.63-fold increase in k(15). In addition, interoccasion variability on k(15) improved the model fit (43.5% [CV%]). Simulations showed a reduced absorbed dose per unit administered activity for salivary glands after increasing radioactivity dosing from 3 to 6 GBq (0.685 Gy/GBq vs. 0.421 Gy/GBq, respectively). All in all, population PK modeling could help to improve future radioligand therapy research.	[Siebinga, Hinke; Dorlo, Thomas P. C.; Huitema, Alwin D. R.; Hendrikx, Jeroen J. M.

Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of the novel synthetic opioid, U-47700, in male rats	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Analgesia; Catalepsy; Metabolites; Opioid; U-47700	MORPHINE; FENTANYL; CONFIRMATION; OVERDOSE; TIME	Novel synthetic opioids are appearing in recreational drug markets worldwide as adulterants in heroin or ingredients in counterfeit analgesic medications. Trans-3,4-dichloro-N-[2-(dimethylamino)cyclohexyl]-N-methyl-benzamide (U-47700) is an example of a non-fentanyl synthetic opioid linked to overdose deaths. Here, we examined the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of U-47700 in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fitted with intravenous (i.v.) catheters and subcutaneous (s.c.) temperature transponders under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia. One week later, rats received s.c. injections of U-47700 HCl (0.3, 1.0 or 3.0 mg/kg) or saline, and blood samples (0.3 mL) were withdrawn via i.v. catheters at 15, 30, 60, 120, 240, 480 min post-injection. Pharmacodynamic effects were assessed at each blood withdrawal, and plasma was assayed for U-47700 and its metabolites by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. U-47700 induced dose-related increases in hot plate latency (ED50 = 0.5 mg/kg) and catalepsy (ED50 = 1.7 mg/kg), while the 3.0 mg/kg dose also caused hypothermia. Plasma levels of U-47700 rose linearly as dose increased, with maximal concentration (C-max) achieved by 15-38 min. C-max values for N-desmethyl-U-47700 and N,N-didesmethyl-U-47700 were delayed but reached levels in the same range as the parent compound. Pharmacodynamic effects were correlated with plasma U-47700 and its N-desmethyl metabolite. Using radioligand binding assays, U-47700 displayed high affinity for mu-opioid receptors (Ki = 11.1 nM) whereas metabolites were more than 18-fold weaker. Our data reveal that U-47700 induces typical mu-opioid effects which are related to plasma concentrations of the parent compound. Given its high potency, U-47700 poses substantial risk to humans who are inadvertently exposed to the drug.

The second and main aim of this study is measure overall and progression-free survival (OS and PFS) and to determine the factors have effect on OS and PFS. Materials and Methods: Patients with mCRPC had Lu-177 PSMA RNT every 6-8 weeks. Therapy response of each cycle determined wit PSA after 6-8 weeks. Overall survival and PFS were measured, then effects of age, Gleason grade, local recurrence, extraabdominopelvic located lymph node metastasis, visceral metastasis, prostate specific antigen (PSA) changing after the first RNT, pretreatment PSA, hemoglobin (Hb), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) values on survivals were determined. Results: Forty-five patients were treated with total of 164 cycles of RNT. Fifteen patients (33%) had PSA decline of >= 50%, 23 patients (51%) showed any PSA decline and 20 patients (44%) showed PSA increase of >= 25%. Median OS and PFS were 17,1 months and 7,4 months. Patients had any or >= 50% PSA response after the first cycle, lower initial ALP (<120U/L) had longer OS and PFS. Patients had normal Hb showed longer OS and patients had lower initial PSA (<51ng/mL) had longer PFS. Patients had PSA progression of >= 25% had shorter OS and PFS. Conclusion: Prostate specific antigen response after the first cycle, lower initial ALP is related to longer OS and PFS. Normal pretreatment Hb is a predictor of longer OS and lower initial PSA is related to longer PFS. Prostate specific antigen progression after the first cycle causes shorterOS and PFS.

We aimed to establish translatable mouse models of disseminated prostate cancer (PCa) to evaluate effectiveness of Ac-225-PSMA-617 at various disease stages. Methods: C4-2, C4-2B, or 22Rv1 cells were injected into the left ventricle of male NSG mice. Disease progression was monitored using bioluminescence imaging (BLI). For treatment, mice were injected with 40 kBq Ac-225-PSMA-617 at one (early treatment cohort) or three weeks (late treatment cohort) post-inoculation. Treatment efficacy was monitored by BLI of whole-body tumor burden. Mice were sacrificed based on body conditioning score. Results: C4-2 cells yielded metastases in liver, lungs, spleen, stomach, bones, and brain - achieving a clinically relevant model of widespread metastatic disease. The disease burden in the early treatment cohort was stable over 27 weeks in 5/9 mice and progressive in 4/9 mice. These mice were sacrificed due to brain metastases. Median survival of the late treatment cohort was superior to controls (13 vs. 7 weeks; p<0.0001) but inferior to that in the early treatment cohort (13 vs. 27 weeks; p<0.001). Late cohort mice succumbed to extensive liver involvement. The 22Rv1 and C4-2B systemic models were not used for treatment due to high kidney metastatic burden or low take rate, respectively. Conclusion: C4-2 cells reproduced metastatic cancer spread most relevantly. Early treatment with Ac-225-PSMA-617 prevented liver metastases and led to significant survival benefit. Late treatment improved survival without reducing tumor burden in the liver, the main site of metastasis. The current findings suggest that early Ac-225-PSMA-617 intervention is more efficacious in the setting of widespread metastatic PCa.	[Stuparu, Andreea D.; Meyer, Catherine A.

Preclinical studies have demonstrated that short-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) can significantly increase PSMA expression on PC cells. Additionally, retrospective clinical data in large patient cohorts suggest a positive association between ongoing ADT and a pathological PSMA PET/CT scan. The present evaluation was conducted to further analyse the influence of long-term ADT on PSMA PET/CT findings.MethodsA retrospective analysis was performed of all 1,704 patients who underwent a Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT scan at our institution from 2011 to 2017 to detect PC. Of 306 patients scanned at least twice, 10 had started and continued ADT with a continuous clinical response between the two PSMA PET/CT scans. These ten patients were included in the current analysis which compared the tracer uptake intensity and volume of PC lesions on PSMA PET/CT before and during ongoing ADT.ResultsOverall, 31 PC lesions were visible in all ten patients before initiation of ADT. However, during ongoing ADT (duration 42-369days, median 230days), only 14 lesions were visible in eight of the ten patients. The average tracer uptake values decreased in 71% and increased in 12.9% of the PC lesions. Of all lesions, 33.3% were still visible in six patients with a complete PSA response (0.1ng/ml).ConclusionContinuous long-term ADT significantly reduces the visibility of castration-sensitive PC on PSMA PET/CT. If the objective is visualization of the maximum possible extent of disease, we recommend referring patients for PSMA PET/CT before starting ADT.

The goal of this study was to determine how structural differences of 3 BPC classes impact binding affinities for the thyroid receptor beta (TR beta) in humans and zebrafish. BPC classes included halogenated bisphenol A derivatives, halogenated oxidative transformation products of 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), and brominated phenols. Affinities were assessed using recombinant TR beta protein in competitive binding assays with 125 I-triiodothyronine (I-125-T-3) as the radioligand. Zebrafish and human TR beta displayed similar binding affinities for T-3 (K-i = 0.40 and 0.49 nM) and thyroxine (T-4, K-i = 6.7 and 6.8 nM). TR beta affinity increased with increasing halogen mass and atomic radius for both species, with the iodinated compounds having the highest affinity within their compound classes. Increasing halogen mass and radius increases the molecular weight, volume, and hydrophobicity of a compound, which are all highly correlated with increasing affinity. TR beta affinity also increased with the degree of halogenation for both species. Human TR beta displayed higher binding affinities for the halogenate bisphenol A compounds, whereas zebrafish TR beta displayed higher affinities for 2,4,6-trichlorophenol and 2,4,6-trifluorophenol. Observed species differences may be related to amino acid differences within the ligand binding domains. Overall, structural variations impact TR beta affinities in a similar manner, supporting the use of zebrafish as a model for TR beta disruption. Further studies are necessary to investigate how the identified structural modifications impact downstream receptor activities and potential in vivo effects.

The benzo-gamma-pyrone scaffold is well-known in medicinal chemistry with diverse pharmacological activities attributed to them, however, their therapeutic potential as adenosine receptor antagonists have not been investigated in detail. To expand on the structure-activity relationships, the present study explored the adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptor binding affinities of a selected series of benzo-gamma-pyrone analogues. In vitro evaluation led to the identification of 5-hydroxy-2-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one with the best adenosine A(2A) receptor affinity among the test compounds and was found to be non-selective (A(1)K(i) = 0.956 mu M; A(2A)K(i) = 1.44 mu M). Hydroxy substitution on ring A and/or B play a key role in modulating the binding affinity at adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptors. Adenosine A(1) receptor affinity was increased to the nanomolar range with hydroxy substitution on C6 (ring A), while meta-hydroxy substitution on ring B governed adenosine A2A receptor affinity. The double bond between C2 and C3 of ring C as well as C2 phenyl substitution was shown to be imperative for both adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptor affinity. Selected benzo-gamma-pyrone derivatives behaved as adenosine A(1) receptor antagonists in the performed GTP shift assays. It may be concluded that benzo-gamma-pyrone based derivatives are suitable leads for designing and identifying adenosine receptor antagonists as treatment of various disorders. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Activities were analyzed with membrane preparations from Sf9 cells, transiently expressing the hH(4)R, G(alpha i2) and G(beta 1 gamma 2) subunits. From the methanolic extract of C. longa curcumin (1), demethoxycurcumin (2) and bis(4-hydroxy-cinnamoyl)methane (3) were isolated, purified with HPLC (elution-time 10.20, 9.66, 9.20 min, respectively) and together with six additional extracts, were characterized via radioligand binding studies at the hH(4)R. Compounds from C. longa were the most potent ligands at the hH(4)R. They exhibited estimated K (i) values of 4.26-6.26 A mu M (1.57-2.31 A mu g/mL) (1); 6.66--8.97 A mu M (2.26-3.04 A mu g/mL) (2) and 10.24-14.57 A mu M (3.16-4.49 A mu g/mL) (3) (95% CI). The estimated K (i) value of the crude extract of curcuma was 0.50-0.81 A mu g/mL. Fractionated curcumin and the crude extract surpassed the effect of pure curcumin with a K (i) value of 5.54 A mu M or 2.04 A mu g/mL [95% CI (4.47-6.86 A mu M), (1.65-2.53 A mu g/mL)]. Within this study, defined compounds of C. longa were recognized as potential ligands and reasonable lead structures at the hH(4)R. The mode of anti-inflammatory action of curcumin was further elucidated and the role of extracts in traditional phytomedicine was strengthened.

The aim of this study was to investigate the comparative roles of DA release vs DA reuptake in the rat striatum with small animal SPECT in relation to l-DOPA-induced behaviors. DAT and D2R binding, together with behavioral measures, were obtained in 99 rats in response to treatment with either 5 or 10 mg/kg l-DOPA or vehicle. The behavioral parameters included the distance travelled, and durations and frequencies of ambulation, sitting, rearing, head-shoulder motility, and grooming. Data were subjected to a cluster analysis and to a multivariate principal component analysis. The highest DAT binding (i.e., the lowest DA reuptake) was associated with the highest, and the lowest DAT binding (i.e., the highest DA reuptake) was associated with the lowest motor/exploratory activity. The highest and the lowest D2R binding (i.e., the lowest and the highest DA release, respectively) were merely associated with the second highest and second lowest levels of motor/exploratory activity. These findings indicate that changes in DA reuptake in response to fluctuating DA levels offer a better prediction of motor activity than the release of DA into the synaptic cleft. This dissociation, as reflected by in vivo DAT and D2R binding data, may be accounted for by the regulatory sensitization meachnisms that occur at D2R binding sites in response to altered levels of DA.

Mirabegron relaxes urethral smooth muscle by a dual mechanism involving <sub>3</sub>-adrenoceptor activation and <sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor blockade	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							BETA-ADRENOCEPTOR SUBTYPES; SELECTIVE BETA(3)-ADRENOCEPTOR AGONIST; URINARY-TRACT SYMPTOMS; OVERACTIVE BLADDER; FUNCTIONAL-ROLE; VAS-DEFERENS; DETRUSOR MUSCLE; CONCISE GUIDE; DOUBLE-BLIND; IN-VITRO	Linked ArticleThis article is commented on by Michel, M. C., pp. 429-430 of this issue. To view this commentary visit . Background and PurposeMirabegron is the first (3)-adrenoceptor agonist approved for treatment of overactive bladder syndrome. This study aimed to investigate the effects of (3)-adrenoceptor agonist mirabegron in mouse urethra. The possibility that mirabegron also exerts (1)-adrenoceptor antagonism was also tested in rat smooth muscle preparations presenting (1A)- (vas deferens and prostate), (1D)- (aorta) and (1B)-adrenoceptors (spleen). Experimental ApproachFunctional assays were carried out in mouse and rat isolated tissues. Competition assays for the specific binding of [H-3]prazosin to membrane preparations of HEK-293 cells expressing each of the human (1)-adrenoceptors, as well as -adrenoceptor mRNA expression and cyclic AMP measurements in mouse urethra, were performed. Key ResultsMirabegron produced concentration-dependent urethral relaxations that were shifted to the right by the selective (3)-adrenoceptor antagonist L-748,337 but unaffected by (1)- and (2)-adrenoceptor antagonists (atenolol and ICI-118,551 respectively). Mirabegron-induced relaxations were enhanced by the PDE4 inhibitor rolipram, and the agonist stimulated cAMP synthesis. Mirabegron also produced rightward shifts in urethral contractions induced by the (1)-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine. Schild regression analysis revealed that mirabegron behaves as a competitive antagonist of (1)-adrenoceptors in urethra, vas deferens and prostate ((1A)-adrenoceptor, pA(2)5.6) and aorta ((1D)-adrenoceptor, pA(2)5.4) but not in spleen ((1B)-adrenoceptor). The affinities estimated for mirabegron in functional assays were consistent with those estimated in radioligand binding with human recombinant (1A)- and (1D)-adrenoceptors (pK(i)6.0). Conclusion and ImplicationsThe effects of mirabegron in urethral smooth muscle are the result of (3)-adrenoceptor agonism together with (1A) and (1D)-adrenoceptor antagonism.	[Alexandre, E.

However, recent evidence suggests that the glutamatergic system plays an important role in the pathophysiology of these disorders. This study pharmacologically characterized a structurally novel metabotropic glutamate 5 (mGlu(5)) receptor negative allosteric modulator, DSR-98776, and evaluated its effect on rodent models of depression and mania. First, DSR-98776 in vitro profile was assessed using intracellular calcium and radioligand binding assays. This compound showed dose dependent inhibitory activity for mGlu(5) receptors by binding to the same allosteric site as 2-methyl-6-(plienylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP), a known mGlu(5) inhibitor. The in vivo therapeutic benefits of DSR-98776 were evaluated in common rodent models of depression and mania. In the rat forced swimming Lest, DSR-98776 (1-3 mg/kg) significantly reduced rats immobility Lime after treatment for 7 consecutive days, while paroxetine (3 and 10 mg/kg) required administration for 2 consecutive weeks to reduce rats immobility Lime. In the mouse forced swimming Lest, acute administration of DSR-98776 (10-30 mg/kg) significantly reduced immobility Lime. This effect was not influenced by 4-chloro-DL-phenylalanine methyl ester hydrochloride-induced 5-HT depletion. Finally, DSR-98776 (30 mg/kg) significantly decreased methamphetamine/chlordiazepoxide-induced hyperactivity in mice, which reflects this compound antimanic-like effect. These results indicate that DSR-98776 acts as an orally potent antidepressant and antimanic in rodent models and can be a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of a broad range of mood disorders with depressive and manic states.

ML-18 is a non-peptide bombesin receptor subtype-3 antagonist which inhibits lung cancer growth	PEPTIDES			English	Article						Bombesin receptor subtype 3; Nonpeptide antagonist; Lung cancer; Proliferation	HUMAN ORPHAN RECEPTOR; PEPTIDE RECEPTOR; HIGH-AFFINITY; EXPRESSION; PHARMACOLOGY; AGONISTS; CLONING; IDENTIFICATION; RADIOLIGAND; SELECTIVITY	Bombesin receptor subtype (BRS)-3 is a G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) for the bombesin (BB)-family of peptides. BRS-3 is an orphan GPCR and little is known of its physiological role due to the lack of specific agonists and antagonists. PD168368 is a nonpeptide antagonist for the neuromedin B (NMB) receptor (R) whereas PD176252 is a nonpeptide antagonist for the gastrin releasing peptide (GRP) R and NMBR but not BRS-3. Here nonpeptide analogs of PD176252 e.g. the S-enantiomer ML-18, and the R-enantiomer, EMY-98, were investigated as BRS-3 antagonists using lung cancer cells. ML-18 and EMY-98 inhibited specific I-125-BA1 (DTyr-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-beta Ala-His-Phe-Nle-NH2)BB6-14 binding to NCI-H1299 lung cancer cells stably transfected with BRS-3 with IC50 values of 4.8 and >100 mu M, respectively. In contrast, ML-18 bound with lower affinity to the GRPR and NMBR with IC50 values of 16 and >100 mu M, respectively. ML-18 (16 mu M), but not its enantiomer EMY-98, inhibited the ability of 10 nM BA1 to elevate cytosolic Ca2+ in a reversible manner using lung cancer cells loaded with FURA2-AM. ML-18 (16 mu M), but not EMY-98, inhibited the ability of 100 nM BA1 to cause tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR and ERK in lung cancer cells. ML-18 but not EMY-98 inhibited the proliferation of lung cancer cells. The results indicate that ML-18 is a nonpeptide BRS-3 antagonist that should serve as a template to improve potency and selectivity. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Natural compounds boldine and menthol are antagonists of human 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors: implications for treating gastrointestinal disorders	NEUROGASTROENTEROLOGY AND MOTILITY			English	Article						5-HT3 receptor; aequorin; irritable bowel syndrome; ligand-gated ion channel; natural compound	IRRITABLE-BOWEL-SYNDROME; PEPPERMINT-OIL CAPSULES; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; SENSORY NEURONS; RAT ILEUM; CHANNELS; EXPRESSION; CURRENTS; MODULATION; ALKALOIDS	Background Impaired 5-HT3 receptor function is likely involved in the pathogenesis of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) and 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are effective treatments for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The monoterpene alcohol menthol and the aporphine alkaloid boldine combat symptoms of gastrointestinal diseases; both interact with other members of the Cys-loop ligand-gated ion channel family and may therefore also act on 5-HT3 receptors. Methods The impact of boldine and menthol on human recombinant homomeric 5-HT(3)A- and heteromeric 5-HT(3)AB receptors in HEK293 cells was determined by radioligand binding, a luminescence-based Ca2+ assay, and a membrane potential assay. 5-HT3 protein and mRNA expression was assessed in human colon tissue. Key Results Boldine and menthol inhibited the 5-HT-induced activation of 5-HT3 receptors in the low and middle micromolar range, respectively. Boldine was a competitive antagonist of both receptors being 6.5- to 10-fold more potent at 5-HT(3)A- vs 5-HT(3)AB receptors. Menthol non-competitively and stereoselectively inhibited both receptors: In contrast to (+)-menthol, (-)-menthol was significantly more potent toward 5-HT(3)A- vs 5-HT(3)AB receptors. We show co-expression of 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunits in the human gut epithelium, the lamina propria, the myenteric plexus, and the muscular cell layer. Conclusions & Inferences The demonstrated 5-HT3 inhibitory effects may be relevant for boldine's and menthol's alleviating properties on FGID and may encourage clinical studies with the compounds or the plant extracts for CINV and IBS treatment. The found receptor-discriminative properties make boldine and (-)-menthol to potentially useful tools for analyzing structural differences between these receptor subtypes.

Although the knowledge of "system level" connectivity in the brain is increasing rapidly, we lack "molecular level" information on brain networks and connectivity patterns. We introduce novel voxel-based positron emission tomography (PET) methods for studying internal neurotransmitter network structure and intercorrelations of different neurotransmitter systems in the human brain. We chose serotonin transporter and mu-opioid receptor for this analysis because of their functional interaction at the cellular level and similar regional distribution in the brain. Twenty-one healthy subjects underwent two consecutive PET scans using [C-11]MADAM, a serotonin transporter tracer, and [C-11]carfentanil, a mu-opioid receptor tracer. First, voxel-by-voxel "intracorrelations" (hub and seed analyses) were used to study the internal structure of opioid and serotonin systems. Second, voxel-level opioid-serotonin intercorrelations (between neurotransmitters) were computed. Regional mu-opioid receptor binding potentials were uniformly correlated throughout the brain. However, our analyses revealed nonuniformity in the serotonin transporter intracorrelations and identified a highly connected local network (midbrain-striatum-thalamus-amygdala). Regionally specific intercorrelations between the opioid and serotonin tracers were found in anteromedial thalamus, amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and left parietal cortex, i.e., in areas relevant for several neuropsychiatric disorders, especially affective disorders. This methodology enables in vivo mapping of connectivity patterns within and between neurotransmitter systems. Quantification of functional neurotransmitter balances may be a useful approach in etiological studies of neuropsychiatric disorders and also in drug development as a biomarker-based rationale for targeted modulation of neurotransmitter networks.

Evaluation of cannabinoid type 1 receptor expression in the rat brain using [<SUP>18</SUP>F]MK-9470 microPET	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						Cannabinoid type 1 receptor; [F-18]MK-9470; MicroPET; Mouse; Rat	IN-VIVO; BINDING-AFFINITY; CB1 RECEPTORS; PET; RADIOLIGAND; QUANTIFICATION; DISEASE; TRACER; LESION; SYSTEM	Purpose The ligand [F-18]MK-9470 is an inverse agonist binding with high affinity and specificity to the cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor. In this study, a semiquantitative acquisition and analysis protocol for investigation of the CB1 receptor distribution in the rat brain was established. Two C57BL/6N mice (one CB1 (-/-) and one wild-type) and 19 Sprague Dawley rats were investigated using a Focus 120 microPET scanner. Seven rats were scanned twice for test-retest evaluation, six rats were scanned for blocking experiments using the inverse CB1 receptor agonist rimonabant, and 19 rats were scanned for baseline studies. Percentage injected dose per millilitre (%ID/ml) or uptake ratios (VOItarget/VOIwhole brain) were calculated. A Bland-Altman-plot was computed and mean values were compared using a two-sided paired t test. Comparing the data from the CB1 (-/-) mouse and the wild-type mouse, [F-18]MK-9470 showed good specificity. Regarding the rat data, there was no relationship between the difference between the test and retest measurements or their mean value. The test and retest data showed a strong correlation (rho (c) = 0.846, p a parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand 0.01; r (Pearson) = 0.857). Equivalence was not found for all regions and not even in the pons at baseline or under blocking condition. Only the baseline studies showed the highest levels of uptake in the caudate-putamen and thalamus, whereas moderate uptake was found in the hippocampus, hypothalamus and cerebellum, and the lowest uptake was observed in the cortex, amygdala and pons. A reference region is not available; however, the proposed analysis method using the parameter uptake ratio is simple and delivers stable results allowing the discrimination of distinct brain regions.

Recent studies suggest that prolonged zolpidem treatment induces tolerance. The aim of this study was to explore the adaptive changes in GABA(A) receptors following short and long-term exposure to zolpidem in vitro. Methods: Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells stably expressing recombinant alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2s GABA(A) receptors were exposed to zolpidem (1 and 10 mu mol/L) for short-term (2 h daily for 1, 2, or 3 consecutive days) or long-term (continuously for 48 h). Radioligand binding studies were used to determine the parameters of [H-3]flunitrazepam binding sites. Results: A single (2 h) or repeated (2 h daily for 2 or 3 d) short-term exposure to zolpidem affected neither the maximum number of [H-3] flunitrazepam binding sites nor the affinity. In both control and short-term zolpidem treated groups, addition of GABA (1 nmol/L-1 mmol/L) enhanced [H-3] flunitrazepam binding in a concentration-dependent manner. The maximum enhancement of [H-3]flunitrazepam binding in short-term zolpidem treated group was not significantly different from that in the control group. In contrast, long-term exposure to zolpidem resulted in significantly increase in the maximum number of [H-3]flunitrazepam binding sites without changing the affinity. Furthermore, long-term exposure to zolpidem significantly decreased the ability of GABA to stimulate [H-3]flunitrazepam binding. Conclusion: The results suggest that continuous, but not intermittent and short-term, zolpidem-exposure is able to induce adaptive changes in GABA(A) receptors that could be related to the development of tolerance and dependence.

Fast dissociation from D-2 receptors may be one of the elements contributing to the lower incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) exhibited by newer antipsychotics. Therefore, we screened for specific D-2 receptor blockers with a fast rate of dissociation. Radioligand binding experiments identified N-[1-(3,4-difluorobenzyl)piperidin-4-yl]-6-(trifluoromethyl)pyridazin-3-amine (JNJ-37822681) as a fast-dissociating D-2 ligand. Its D-2 receptor specificity was high compared with atypical antipsychotics, with little activity at receptors associated with un-wanted effects [alpha(1), alpha(2), H-1, muscarinic, and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) type 2C] and for receptors that may interfere with the effects of D-2 antagonism (D-1, D-3, and 5-HT2A). JNJ-37822681 occupied D-2 receptors in rat brain at relatively low doses (ED50 0.39 mg/kg) and was effective in animal models of psychosis (e.g., inhibition of apomorphine-induced stereotypy or D-amphetamine/phencyclidine-induced hyperlocomotion). Prolactin levels increased from an ED50 (0.17 mg/kg, peripheral D-2 receptors) close to the ED50 required for apomorphine antagonism (0.19 mg/kg, central D-2 receptors), suggesting excellent brain disposition and minimal prolactin release at therapeutic doses. JNJ-37822681 induced catalepsy and inhibited avoidance behavior, but with a specificity margin relative to apomorphine antagonism that was larger than that obtained for haloperidol and similar to that obtained for olanzapine. This larger specificity margin (compared with haloperidol) may reflect lower EPS liability and less behavioral suppression after JNJ-37822681. JNJ-37822681 is a novel, potent, specific, centrally active, fast-dissociating D-2 antagonist with optimal brain disposition, and it is the first compound that allows the evaluation of the potential value of fast D-2 antagonism for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

GAD autoantibody epitope pattern after GAD-alum treatment in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Aims: We have previously shown that two injections of glutamic acid decarboxylase formulated in alum (GAD-alum) preserved residual insulin secretion in children and adolescents with recent onset type 1 diabetes (T1D), and was accompanied by increased GAD autoantibody (GADA) titers. The aim of this study was to investigate whether GAD-alum treatment affected the GADA epitope pattern. Methods: Serum samples from patients treated with GAD-alum (n = 33) or placebo (n = 27), at baseline, 1, 3, 9, and 15 months after the initial injection, were tested for their binding capacity to specific GADA epitopes in an epitope-specific radioligand binding assay with six recombinant Fab (rFab) (b96.11, DPA, DPD, MICA3, b78, and N-GAD65 mAb). Results: No significant differences in variability of binding to any of the tested rFab were observed from baseline to 15 months. There was a sustained low binding of GADA to the b78- and N-GAD65 mAb-defined epitopes, often recognized by GADA in patients with stiff person syndrome (SPS) and seldom in T1D patients. However, binding of GADA to the T1D-associated b96.11-defined epitope increased between baseline and 3 months in GAD-alum (-8.1%, min -72.4%, max 39.6%) compared to placebo patients (1.5%, min -28.3%, max 28.6%) (p = 0.02). Subsequently, the b96.11-defined epitope recognition returned to levels similar to that observed at baseline. Conclusions: GAD-alum injections did not affect binding of GADA to SPS-related epitopes, further supporting the safety of the treatment. There were no changes in GADA epitope specificity to the T1D-related epitopes, except for a temporarily increased binding to one of the tested epitopes.

In humans and some mammal species the increase of the activity of gonadotropic axis accompanies the decrease in the rate of growth at puberty. The effect of 17 beta-estradiol and/or leptin administration on the somatotropic and gonadotropic axes was studied using prepubertal female rats as an animal model. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prepubertal female rats received estradiol/saline, estradiol/leptin, oil/leptin or oil/saline (vehicles) respectively. The changes of growth rate, and serum 17 beta-estradiol, leptin, GH, IGF-I and gonadotropins levels as well as LHRH and estrogen receptor (ER) concentrations in the medial basal hypothalamus (MBH) and the pituitary were determined. All hormones concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay and ER by radioligand methods. RESULTS: In estradiol and/or leptin treated animals noticeable reduction of rate of growth was found. The decrease of growth in response to estradiol treatment accompanied the increase GH level and the decrease of IGF-I concentration in the circulation. Both hormones operating together activated reproductive axis, what was manifested by a significant increase of LHRH abundant in the hypothalamus as well as elevated LH and FSH levels in the circulation. In these rats a significant decrease of the estrogen receptor concentrations in the pituitary was observed. CONCLUSION: The role of estradiol and leptin in the control of growth and reproduction seems to overlap only partially. Estradiol plays a significant role in the activation of the reproductive axis, and leptin takes part as a permissive factor in pubertal process.

High constitutive hH(4)R activity may have pathophysiological implications in which case inverse agonists may behave differently than neutral antagonists. To learn more about the structural requirements for hH(4)R inverse agonism, we investigated 25 compounds (indole, benzimidazole, and thienopyrrole derivatives) structurally related to the standard antagonist JNJ-7777120 [1-[(5chloro- 1H-indol-2-yl) carbonyl]-4-methyl-piperazine]. We characterized the compounds in radioligand binding assays by using [H-3] histamine ([H-3] HA) and in steady-state GTPase assays in the presence (antagonist mode) and absence (inverse agonist mode) of the agonist HA, yielding the following results: 1) Twenty-two compounds were inverse agonists (efficacy: 15-62% of the THIO effect), and only three compounds (12%) showed neutral antagonism. Thus, inverse agonism is far more common than neutral antagonism. 2) The inverse agonistic efficacy of the R5-monosubstituted indolederived compounds increased with the volume of R5. R5 may interact with Trp6.48 of the rotamer toggle switch and stabilize the inactive receptor conformation. 3) A subset of compounds showed large differences between the K i value ;from [H-3] HA competition binding and the EC50 value from steady-state GTPase assays, whereas the K-b values were closer to the K i values. Thus, the two-state model should be extended to a model comprising a constitutively active hH(4)R state, which can be discriminated by inverse agonists from a structurally distinct HA-stabilized active state.

We have performed molecular pharmacology profiling of this drug on a panel of 70 targets to characterize the spectrum of its activity, with the goal to possibly elucidate a potential molecular mechanism for the re-purposing of this drug candidate. We show that in addition to histaminergic receptors, Dimebon exhibits high affinity to a constellation of other receptors; specifically serotonergic, alpha-adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors. Good correlations with published literature were obtained for the affinity of Dimebon to inhibit butyrylcholinesterase, interact with H1 and H2 receptors (Ki = 2 nM and 232 nM), and to block histamine-induced calcium fluxes in cells. Within serotonergic receptor sub-types, Dimebon shows highest affinity for 5-HT7 (Ki=8 nM) and 5-HT6 (Ki=34 nM) receptors, with the relative affinity rank-order of 5-HT7 > 5-HT6 >= 5-HT2A = 5-HT2C > 5-HT1A = 5-HT1B > 5-HT2B=5-HT3. Dimebon also interacts with adrenergic receptor subtypes (rank-order: alpha 1A (Ki = 55 nM)= alpha 1B >= alpha 2A (Ki = 120 nM) = alpha 1D), and dopaminergic receptor subtypes (rank-order: D1=D2S=D2L (Ki similar to 600 nM) > D3 >= D4.2>D4.4 >= D4.7). These results demonstrate a molecular pharmacological basis for re-purposing of this drug to new therapeutic areas. The informed targeting of the combined molecular target activities may provide additional advantages for patients suffering from similar diseases syndromes. Understanding the role that different pathways play in diseases with complex etiologies may allow for the rational design of multi-target drugs.	[Okun, I.; Tkachenko, S.

To establish whether targeting CRAC might counteract intestinal inflammation, we evaluated the in vitro effect of a selective CRAC inhibitor on T cell cytokine production and T-bet expression by lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) and biopsy specimens from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. The inhibitory activity of the CRAC blocker was investigated through patch-clamp experiments on rat basophilic leukemia cells and fluorometric imaging plate reader intracellular Ca2+ assays using thapsigargin-stimulated Jurkat T cells and its detailed selectivity profile defined using a range of in vitro radioligand binding and functional assays. Anti-CD3/CD28-stimulated LPMC and biopsy specimens from 51 patients with IBD were cultured with a range of CRAC inhibitor concentrations (0.01-10 mu M). IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-8, and IL-17 were analyzed by ELISA. T-bet was determined by immunoblotting. We found that the CRAC blocker concentration-dependently inhibited CRAC current in rat basophilic leukemia cells and thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ influx in Jurkat T cells. A concentration-dependent reduction in T-bet expression and production of IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-17, but not IL-8, was observed in IBD LPMC and biopsy specimens treated with the CRAC inhibitor.

Synthesis and enzymatic cleavage of dual-ligand quantum dots	MATERIALS SCIENCE & ENGINEERING C-BIOMIMETIC AND SUPRAMOLECULAR SYSTEMS			English	Article						Quantum dot; Dual-ligand; MMP-7; Targeted therapy; Nanotechnology; Tissue specific targeting	MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASES; IN-VIVO; MATRILYSIN EXPRESSION; RADIOLIGAND BINDING; CHOROID-PLEXUS; BREAST-CANCER; CELL-LINES; MMP-7; CONJUGATE; CARCINOMA	Site directed therapy promises to minimize treatment-limiting systemic effects associated with cytotoxic agents that have no specificity for pathologic tissues. One general strategy is to target cell surface receptors uniquely presented on particular tissues. Highly specific in vivo targeting of an emerging neoplasm through a single molecular recognition mechanism has not generally been successful. Nonspecific binding and specific binding to non-target cells compromise the therapeutic index of small molecule, ubiquitous cancer targeting ligands. In this work, we have designed and fabricated a nanoparticle (NP) construct that could potentially overcome the current limitations of targeted in vivo delivery. Quantum dots (QDs) were functionalized with a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) modified to enable specific cleavage by matrix metalloprotease-7 (MMP-7), The QDs were further functionalized with folic acid, a ligand for a cell surface receptor that is overexpressed in many tumors, but also expressed in some normal tissues. The nanomolecular construct is designed so that the PEG initially conceals the folate ligand and construct binding to cells is inhibited. MMP-7 activated peptide cleavage and subsequent unmasking of the folate ligand occurs only near tumor tissue, resulting in a proximity activated (PA) targeting system. QDs functionalized with both the MMP-7 cleavable substrate and folic acid were successfully synthesized and characterized. The proteolytic capability of the dual ligand QD construct was quantitatively assessed by fluorometric analysis and compared to a QD construct functionalized with only the PA ligand. The dual ligand PA nanoparticles studied here exhibit significant susceptibility to cleavage by MMP-7 at physiologically relevant conditions. The capacity to autonomously convert a biopassivated nanostructure to a tissue-specific targeted delivery agent in vivo represents a paradigm change for site-directed therapies.

J	Chen, SR; Pan, HL				Chen, Shao-Rui; Pan, Hui-Lin			Removing TRPV1-expressing primary afferent neurons potentiates the spinal analgesic effect of δ-opioid agonists on mechano-nociception	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						TRPV1; opioids; opioid receptors; spinal cord; pain; analgesia	DORSAL-ROOT GANGLIA; SENSORY NEURONS; BANDEIRAEA-SIMPLICIFOLIA; RECEPTOR MODULATION; DIABETIC-RATS; CA2+ CURRENTS; UP-REGULATION; LAMINA-II; CORD; PAIN	Most delta-opioid receptors are located on the presynaptic terminals of primary afferent neurons in the spinal cord. However, their presence in different phenotypes of primary afferent neurons and their contribution to the analgesic effect of delta-opioid agonists are not fully known. Resiniferatoxin (RTX) is an ultra-potent transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 channel (TRPV1) agonist and can selectively remove TRPV1-expressing primary afferent neurons. In this study, we determined the role of delta-opioid receptors expressed on TRPV1 sensory neurons in the antinociceptive effect of the delta-opioid receptor agonists [D-Pen(2),D-Pen(5)]-enkephalin and [D-Ala(2),Glu(4)]-deltorphin. Nociception was measured by testing the mechanical withdrawal threshold in the hindpaw of rats. Changes in the delta-opioid receptors were assessed using immunocytochemistry and the [H-3]-naltrindole radioligand binding. In RTX-treated rats, the delta-opioid receptor on TRPV1-immunoreactive dorsal root ganglion neurons and afferent terminals in the spinal cord was diminished. RTX treatment also significantly reduced the maximal specific binding sites (31%) of the delta-opioid receptors in the dorsal spinal cord. Interestingly, intrathecal injection Of [D-Pen(2),D-Pen(5)]-enkephalin or {D-Ala(2),Glu(4)]-deltorphin produced a large and prolonged increase in the nociceptive threshold in RTX-treated rats. These findings indicate that loss of TRPV1-expressing afferent neurons leads to a substantial reduction in presynaptic delta-opioid receptors in the spinal dorsal horn. However, the effect of delta-opioid agonists on mechano-nociception is paradoxically potentiated in the absence of TRPV1-expressing sensory neurons. This information is important to our understanding of the cellular sites and mechanisms underlying the spinal analgesic effect of delta-opioid agonists. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

After the intravenous administration of N-[C-11] methyl-2-(4'-methylaminophenyl)-6-hydroxybenzothiazole ( or [C-11] PIB for "Pittsburgh Compound-B") with high-specific radioactivity, the Tg mice exhibited high-level retention of radioactivity in amyloid-rich regions. PET investigation for Tg mice over an extended range of ages, including longitudinal assessments, demonstrated age-dependent increase in radioligand binding consistent with progressive amyloid accumulation. Reduction in amyloid levels in the hippocampus of Tg mice was also successfully monitored by multiple PET scans along the time course of anti-amyloid treatment using an antibody against amyloid beta peptide (A beta). Moreover, PET scans with [F-18]fluoroethyl-DAA1106, a radiotracer for activated glia, were conducted for these individuals parallel to amyloid imaging, revealing treatment-induced neuroinflammatory responses, the magnitude of which intimately correlated with the levels of pre-existing amyloid estimated by [C-11]PIB. It is also noteworthy that the localization and abundance of [ 11C] PIB autoradiographic signals were closely associated with those of N- terminally truncated and modified A beta, A beta N3-pyroglutamate, in Alzheimer's disease ( AD) and Tg mouse brains, implying that the detectability of amyloid by [ 11C] PIB positron emission tomography is dependent on the accumulation of specific A beta subtypes. Our results support the usefulness of the small animal-dedicated PET system in conjunction with high-specific radioactivity probes and appropriate Tg models not only for clarifying the mechanistic properties of amyloidogenesis in mouse models but also for preclinical tests of emerging diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to AD.

Persistent cerebrovascular effects of MDMA and acute responses to the drug	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						dark agouti rat; flow-metabolism relationship; local cerebral blood flow; local cerebral glucose utilization; serotonin	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; INDUCED SEROTONIN DEFICITS; PIAL ARTERIOLAR CALIBER; 3,4-METHYLENEDIOXYMETHAMPHETAMINE MDMA; GLUCOSE-UTILIZATION; RAT-BRAIN; METHYLENEDIOXYMETHAMPHETAMINE MDMA; 3,4-METHYLENEDIOXYAMPHETAMINE MDA; METHYLENEDIOXYAMPHETAMINE MDA	Acutely,3,4,-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) induces cerebrovascular dysfunction [Quate et al., ( 2004) Psychopharmacol., 173, 287-295]. In the longer term the same single dose results in depletion of 5-hydroxytrptamine (5-HT) nerve terminals. In this study we examined the cerebrovascular consequences of this persistent neurodegeneration, and the acute effects of subsequent MDMA exposure, upon the relationship that normally exists between local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) and local cerebral glucose utilization (LCMRglu). Dark agouti (DA) rats were pre-treated with 15 mg/kg i.p. MDMA or saline. Three weeks later, rats from each pre-treatment group were treated with an acute dose of MDMA (15mg/kg i.p.) or saline. Quantitative autoradiographic imaging was used to measure LCBF or LCMRglu with [C-14]-iodoantipyrine and [C-14]-2-deoxyglucose, respectively. Serotonergic terminal depletion was assessed using radioligand binding with [H-3]-paroxetine and immunohistochemistry. Three weeks after MDMA pre-treatment there were significant reductions in densities of 5-HT transporter (SERT)-positive fibres (-46%) and [H-3]-paroxetine binding (-47%). In animals pre-treated with MDMA there were widespread significant decreases in LCMRglu, but no change in LCBF indicating a persistent loss of cerebrovascular constrictor tone. In both pre-treatment groups, acute MDMA produced significant increases in LCMRglu, while LCBF was significantly decreased. In 50% of MDMA-pre-treated rats, random areas of focal hyperaemia indicated a loss of autoregulatory capacity in response to MDMA-induced hypertension. These results suggest that cerebrovascular regulatory dysfunction resulting from acute exposure to MDMA is not diminished by previous exposure, despite a significant depletion in 5-HT terminals. However, there may be a sub-population, or individual circumstances, in which this dysfunction develops into a condition that might predispose to stroke.

In the current report, we describe the cDNA cloning, mRNA localization in the rat central nervous system, and pharmacological characterization of three additional rH(3)R splice variants (rH(3D), rH(3E), and rH(3F)) that differ from the previously published isoforms in that they result from an additional alternative-splicing event. These new H3R isoforms lack the seventh transmembrane (TM) helix and contain an alternative, putatively extracellular, C terminus (6TM-rH(3) isoforms). After heterologous expression in COS-7 cells, radioligand binding or functional responses upon the application of various H3R ligands could not be detected for the 6TM-rH(3) isoforms. In contrast to the rH(3A) receptor (rH(3A)R), detection of the rH(3D) isoform using hemagglutinin antibodies revealed that the rH3D isoform remains mainly intracellular. The expression of the rH(3D-F) splice variants, however, modulates the cell surface expression-levels and subsequent functional responses of the 7TM H3R isoforms. Coexpression of the rH(3A)R and the rH(3)D isoforms resulted in the intracellular retention of the rH(3A)R and reduced rH(3A)R functionality. Finally, we show that in rat brain, the H3R mRNA expression levels are modulated upon treatment with the convulsant pentylenetetrazole, suggesting that the rH(3)R isoforms described herein thus represent a novel physiological mechanism for controlling the activity of the histaminergic system.

J	Ajayi, AAL; Halushka, PV				Ajayi, AAL; Halushka, PV			Castration reduces platelet thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> receptor density and aggregability	QJM-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICINE			English	Article							CORONARY-ARTERY-DISEASE; ANDROGEN REGULATION; HEART-DISEASE; DIABETIC-RATS; TESTOSTERONE; EXPRESSION; BINDING; REACTIVITY; CELLS; MEN	Background: Exogenously administered testosterone upregulates platelet thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)) receptors and increases aggregation response to thromboxane mimetics in healthy male volunteers. However, the biological impact of endogenous testosterone on platelet TXA(2) receptor expression, especially in older men at risk of coronary artery disease, is unclear. Aim: To investigate the impact of reduction in circulating testosterone on platelet TXA(2) receptor expression in older men. Design: Cross-sectional case-control study. Methods: We studied surgically and/or medically castrated men with prostate cancer (group A, n = 8, aged 71 +/- 8 years) and age-matched, uncastrated urology patients (group B, n = 7, aged 67 +/- 9 years). Plasma testosterone was measured by radioimmunoassay. Platelet TXA(2) receptor expression was assessed by radioligand binding studies using radioactive I-125-BOP. Platelet aggregation responses to TXA(2)-mimetic I-BOP, and to thrombin, were also studied. Results: Group A had significantly lower plasma testosterone than group B (16 +/- 5 ng/dl vs. 308 +/- 47 ng/dl, p < 0.001). Platelet TXA(2) receptor density (B-max) but not affinity (K-d) was lower in group A (0.50 +/- 0.12 vs. 1.01 +/- 0.17 pmol/mg protein, p = 0.03). Maximum platelet aggregation response to I-BOP (E-max), but not sensitivity (EC50) was lower in group A (53 +/- 2% vs. 63 +/- 2%, p = 0.003 ANOVA). In vitro, high concentrations of hydroxyflutamide (100 mu M) competitively inhibited U46619-induced platelet aggregation in washed platelets, without affecting the binding of I-125-BOP to platelet TXA(2) receptors. Discussion: Endogenous testosterone regulates platelet TXA(2) receptor B-max and the E-max aggregation response to thromboxane mimetic I-BOP. Blockade of androgen receptors or inhibition of testosterone production may reduce platelet aggregation responses. Preliminary evidence suggests the presence of functional androgen receptors on human platelets, which may regulate TXA(2) receptor expression.

Methods: T cells from eu-, hypo- ( by propylthiouracil treatment) and hyperthyroid (by thyroxine, T4 administration) mice were purified and specific radioligand binding assays were performed. The effects of the beta-agonist isoproterenol (ISO) on intracellular levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) were determined. Mitogen-induced T-cell proliferation was measured by [H-3]-thymidine incorporation. Finally, protein kinase C (PKC) activity in cytosol and membrane fractions were determined using radiolabelled enzymatic substrates. Results: A decrease or a non-significant increase in beta AR number was found on T lymphocytes from hypo- and hyperthyroid mice compared to euthyroid controls. ISO stimulation of cAMP levels was lower in hypothyroid and higher in hyperthyroid T lymphocytes compared to controls. T-selective mitogen-induced proliferation was increased in T4-treated animals, but decreased in hypothyroid mice. During the peak of proliferation, downregulation of beta AR was observed in all animals. However, a higher or a lower decrease was observed in hyper- and hypothyroid T cells, respectively. In parallel, a higher translocation of PKC activity was observed in hyperthyroid cells, and a lower one was found in hypothyroid lymphocytes with respect to controls. Conclusions: These results indicate that intracellular signals triggered by mitogen activation, namely PKC, would be related to differential beta AR downregulation in T lymphocytes depending on the thyroid hormone status, contributing to the distinct proliferative responses found in hypo- or hyperthyroidism compared to the euthyroid state.

Normotensive and spontaneous hypertensive rats were orally fed with buflomedil (150mg/kg). The drug effects on blood pressure and heart rate were monitored by photoelectric volume oscillometric method. Prostate tissue strips from normotensive rats were contracted in vitro in organ bath by phenylephrine (10(-8) to 10(-2) M). The inhibitory effects of buflomedil (10(-9) to 10(-7) M) on the phenylephrine-induced contractions were measured. Radioligand binding displacement study by buflomedil was performed on rat prostate alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor (AR) and spleen alpha(1B)-AR. Furthermore the effects of buflomedil and WB-4101 on phenylephrine (10 muM) activated uptake of 2-[C-14]-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) into C2C12 cells were evaluated. The results showed that buflomedil feeding did not alter the systolic blood pressure of either spontaneous hypertensive rats or normal rats. Dose-inhibition curves of phenylephrine-induced prostate contraction demonstrated a higher potency of buflomedil than tamsulosin. Buflomedil displaced [H-3]prazosin binding in a concentration-dependent manner both in rat prostate alpha(1A)-AR and spleen alpha(1B)-AR. The ratio of affinity to alpha(1A)-AR and alpha(1B)-AR for buflomedil was 4.06/6.84, indicating selectivity on alpha(1A)-AR over alpha(1B)-AR. Activation of C2C12 cell alpha(1A)-AR by phenylephrine increased the glucose uptake to 116%. Both buflomedil and WB-4101 inhibited the uptake in a concentration-dependent manner. In conclusion, the findings showed that buflomedil has preferential alpha(1A)-AR antagonistic effect to inhibit prostate contraction without significantly affecting the blood pressure.

Four of the clones e(+R), e(+B&D), e(wh)/e(y), E-Rfayoumi gave receptors to which melanocortin stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) bound with similar IC50 values and responded to alpha-MSH by increasing intracellular cAMP levels in a dose-dependent manner. Three of the cMC1 receptors; e(b), E and E-R, did not show any specific binding to the radioligand, but were found to be constitutively active in the cAMP assay. The E and E-R alleles are associated with black feather colour in chicken while the e (b) allele gives rise to brownish pigmentation. The three constitutively active receptors share a mutation of Glu to Lys in position 92. This mutation was previously found in darkly pigmented sombre mice, but constitutively active MC receptors have not previously been shown in any nonmammalian species. We also inserted the Glu to Lys mutation in the human MC1 and MC4 receptors. In contrast with the chicken clones, the hMC1-E94K receptor bound to the ligand, but was still constitutively active independently of ligand concentration. The hMC4-E100K receptor did not bind to the MSH ligand and was not constitutively active. The results indicate that the structural requirements that allow the receptor to adapt an active conformation without binding to a ligand, as a consequence of this E/K mutation, are not conserved within the MC receptors. The results are discussed in relationship to feather colour in chicken, molecular receptor structures and evolution. We suggest that properties for the 'E92K switch' mechanism may have evolved in an ancestor common to chicken and mammals and were maintained over long time periods through evolutionary pressure, probably on closely linked structural features.

As episodes of depression often occur some time after a stress experience we investigated whether stress-induced changes in the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor (alpha(2)-AR) system persist throughout a post-stress recovery period. Brains of male tree shrews were analysed after 44 days of chronic psychosocial stress and after a subsequent 10-day recovery period. Expression of RNA for alpha(2A) and alpha(2C)-adrenoceptors was quantified by in situ hybridization, and receptor binding was determined by in vitro receptor autoradiography. Activities of the sympathetic nervous system and of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis were increased during chronic stress but normalized during recovery. alpha(2A)-AR RNA in the glutamatergic neurons of the lateral reticular nucleus was elevated significantly after stress and after recovery (by 29% and 17%). In the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, subtype A expression was enhanced after recovery (by 33%). In the locus coeruleus, subtype A autoreceptor expression was not changed significantly. Subtype C expression in the caudate nucleus and putamen was elevated by stress (by 5 and 4%, respectively) but normalized during recovery. Quantification of H-3-RX821002 binding revealed receptor upregulation during stress and/or recovery. Our data therefore show: (i) that chronic psychosocial stress differentially regulates expression of alpha(2) -adrenoceptor subtypes A and C; (ii) that subtype A heteroreceptor expression is persistently upregulated whereas (iii), subtype C upregulation is only transient. The present findings coincide with post mortem studies in depressed patients revealing upregulation of alpha(2A)-ARs.

They potentiate GABA-stimulated guanosine 5'-O-(3-[S-35]thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma[S-35]) binding to membranes from a GABA(B(1b/2)) expressing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line at low micromolar concentrations and are ineffective in the absence of GABA. The structurally related compounds propofol and malonoben are inactive. Similar effects of CGP7930 are seen in a GTP gamma[S-35] binding assay using a native GABA(B) receptor preparation (rat brain membranes). Receptor selectivity is demonstrated because no modulation of glutamate-induced GTP gamma[S-35] binding is seen in a CHO cell line expressing the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 2. Dose-response curves with GABA in the presence of different fixed concentrations of CGP7930 reveal an increase of both the potency and maximal efficacy of GABA at the GABA(B(1b/2)) heteromer. Radioligand binding studies show that CGP7930 increases the affinity of agonists but acts at a site different from the agonist binding site. Agonist affinity is not modulated by CGP7930 at homomeric GABA(B(1b)) receptors. In addition to GTP gamma[S-35] binding, we show that CGP7930 also has modulatory effects in cellular assays such as GABA(B) receptor-mediated activation of inwardly rectifying potassium channels in Xenopus laevis oocytes and Ca2+ signaling in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Furthermore, we show that CGP7930 enhances the inhibitory effect of L-baclofen on the oscillatory activity of cultured cortical neurons. This first demonstration of positive allosteric modulation at GABA(B) receptors may represent a novel means of therapeutic interference with the GABA-ergic system.

Methods and Results-Left ventricular (LV) remodeling and function were assessed by 2D echocardiography and isolated perfused heart studies in 6-week post-MI and sham-operated rats. LV myocytes from sham and noninfarcted MI hearts were used for morphometric and functional studies. beta-Adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) agonist isoproterenol (ISO)-induced contractile response was measured in isolated hearts. The effects of ISO and forskolin on contractile function and calcium transients of isolated myocytes were recorded. ISO-induced cAMP generation was compared in sham and MI myocytes. beta-AR density was measured by radioligand binding. MI hearts were remodeled (LV diameter 8.5+/-0.3 versus 5.7+/-0.3 mm, P<0.001) and showed global (% fractional shortening 19.1+/-2.5 versus 55.3+/-2.2, P<0.01) and regional contractile dysfunction of noninfarcted myocardium (% systolic posterior wall thickening 37+/-4 versus 62+/-10, P<0.01). Isolated heart function (LV developed pressure 58+/-2 versus 72+/-3 mm Hg, P=0.004) and ISO concentration response were reduced in MI hearts. Myocytes from the noninfarcted LV were structurally remodeled (32% longer and 18% wider), but their contractile response and intracellular calcium kinetics to ISO and forskolin were not diminished. beta-AR receptor density (B-max 24+/-1.5 versus 22.4+/-1.6 fmol/mg protein) and beta-AR agonist-stimulated cAMP were similar in both groups. Conclusions-Isolated myocytes from the remodeled and dysfunctional myocardium are structurally modified but contract normally under basal conditions and in response to beta-AR stimulation. beta-AR density is preserved in remodeled myocytes. Nonmyocyte factors may be more important in the genesis of contractile dysfunction in the remodeled rat heart up to 6 weeks after MI.

Cholinergic system adaptations are associated with cognitive function in people recently abstinent from smoking: a (-)-[<SUP>18</SUP>F]flubatine PET study	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; CONSTANT INFUSION; DOPAMINE RELEASE; TOBACCO SMOKING; FAGERSTROM TEST; FRONTAL-CORTEX; CESSATION; AVAILABILITY; SENSITIVITY; DEPENDENCE	The cholinergic system is a critical mediator of cognition in animals. People who smoke cigarettes exhibit cognitive deficits, especially during quit attempts. Few studies jointly examine the cholinergic system and cognition in people while trying to quit smoking. We used positron emission tomography (PET) brain imaging with the beta(2)-subunit containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (beta(2)*-nAChR) partial agonist radioligand (-)-[F-18]flubatine and the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine to jointly examine the cholinergic system, smoking status, and cognition. (-)-[F-18]Flubatine scans and cognitive data were acquired from twenty people who recently stopped smoking cigarettes (aged 38 +/- 11 years; 6 female, 14 male; abstinent 7 +/- 1 days) and 27 people who never smoked cigarettes (aged 29 +/- 8 years; 11 female, 16 male). A subset of fifteen recently abstinent smokers and 21 never smokers received a mid-scan physostigmine challenge to increase acetylcholine levels. Regional volume of distribution (V-T) was estimated with equilibrium analysis at "baseline" and post-physostigmine. Participants completed a cognitive battery prior to (-)-[F-18]flubatine injection and physostigmine administration assessing executive function (Groton Maze Learning test), verbal learning (International Shopping List test), and working memory (One Back test). Physostigmine significantly decreased cortical (-)-[F-18]flubatine V-T, consistent with increased cortical acetylcholine levels reducing the number of beta(2)*-nAChR sites available for (-)-[F-18]flubatine binding, at comparable magnitudes across groups (p values < 0.05). A larger magnitude of physostigmine-induced decrease in (-)-[F-18]flubatine V-T was significantly associated with worse executive function in people who recently stopped smoking (p values < 0.05). These findings underscore the role of the cholinergic system in early smoking cessation and highlight the importance of neuroscience-informed treatment strategies.	[Calakos, Katina C.

We investigated the efficacy of Ac-225-PSMA-617 relative to (177)LuPSMA-617 using subcellular dosimetry. Methods: A 3-dimensional model of prostate cancer was constructed. For each decay, the absorbed and equivalent radiation dose to the cell nuclei was calculated. The relative efficacy per administered activity was calculated by taking into account the differences in residence time and tumor uptake. Results: As the tumor size increased, the absorbed dose from Ac-225-PSMA-617 increased linearly (R-2: 0.99) and reached an asymptote near the maximum alpha range (85 um), whereas the absorbed dose from Lu-177-PSMA-617 continued to increase linearly (R-2: 0.99). The equivalent dose per decay was 2,320, 2,900, and 823-fold higher in favor of Ac-225-PSMA-617 compared to Lu-177-PSMA,617 in a single cell, 100 mu m-radius micrometastasis, and macroscopic tumor, respectively. Per administered activity, the relative efficacy of Ac-225-PSMA-617 compared to Lu-177-PSMA-617 in respective tumor sizes was at least 3,480, 4,350, and 1,230-fold higher, and possibly 11,800, 14,900, and 4,200-fold higher considering differences in tumor uptake. Conclusion: At commonly administered 1,000-fold lower activity of Ac-22(5)-PSMA-617 relative to Lu-177-PSMA-617, the equivalent radiation dose deposited by Ac-225-PSMA-617 is higher in measurable disease and much higher in microscopic disease compared to Lu-177-PSMA-617.

In particular, the upregulation of MAO-B in Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and cancer augmented the development of selective MAO-B inhibitors for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, such as the antiparkinsonian MAO-B irreversible binder L-deprenyl (Selegiline (R)). Herein we report on the synthesis of novel fluorinated indanone derivatives for PET imaging of MAO-B in the brain. Out of our series, the derivatives 6, 8, 9 and 13 are amongst the most affine and selective ligands for MAO-B reported so far. For the derivative 6-((3fluorobenzyl)oxy)-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-one (6) exhibiting an outstanding affinity (Ki MAO-B = 6 nM), an automated copper-mediated radiofluorination starting from the pinacol boronic ester 17 is described. An in vitro screening in different species revealed a MAO-B region-specific accumulation of [F-18]6 in rats and piglets in comparison to L-[H-3]deprenyl. The pre-clinical in vivo assessment of [F-18]6 in mice demonstrated the potential of indanones to readily cross the blood-brain barrier. Nonetheless, parallel in vivo metabolism studies indicated the presence of blood-brain barrier metabolites, thus arguing for further structural modifications. With the matching analytical profiles of the radiometabolite analysis from the in vitro liver microsome studies and the in vivo evaluation, the structure's elucidation of the blood-brain barrier penetrant radiometabolites is possible and will serve as basis for the development of new indanone derivatives suitable for the PET imaging of MAO-B.

These radiopharmaceuticals and their nonradioactive reference ligands are generally obtained in low (radio)chemical yields. In the present study, we investigated high-yield synthesis of F-18-RO948 ([F-18]1) and its nonradioactive ligand (1). The ligand 1 was synthesized by a Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reaction between 9-(4-methoxybenzyl)-9H-pyrrolo[2,3-b:4,5-c ']dipyridin-2-yl trifluoromethanesulfonate (3) and 2-fluoro-5-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)pyridine (4), followed by oxidative removal of the para-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group with ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN). This two-step reaction gave 1 in 55.8% yield. The precursor for [F-18]1 was synthesized from 3 and 2-nitro-5-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)pyridine (6). The resulting PMB-protected precursor 8 was obtained in 74.5% yield. [F-18]1 was synthesized by radiofluorination of 8 (radiochemical conversion (RCC): 95.7 +/- 1.7%), followed by deprotection of the PMB group with CAN. This one-pot, two-step radiochemical synthesis followed by HPLC purification gave [F-18]1 in high decay-corrected radiochemical yield (54-60%). The RCC of [F-18]fluoride to [F-18]1 in our two-step synthesis method was similar to that in a one-step radiofluorination reaction of a tert-butoxycarbonyl (BOC)-protected precursor 10 that proceeds with concomitant thermal deprotection of the BOC group. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that this high-yield synthesis method is useful for the synthesis of F-18-labeled (NH)heteroarene compounds.

The 5-HT6 receptor is one of the more recently identified serotonin receptors in central nervous system and, because of its role in memory and cognitive processes, is considered as a promising therapeutic target. Methods: In-vitro autoradiography and saturation binding assays were performed in postmortem brain tissues from rat, pig, non-human primate and human caudate nucleus, completed by serum stability assessment in all species and cerebral radiometabolite and biodistribution studies in rat. Results: In all species, autoradiography data revealed high binding levels of [F-18]2FNQ1P in cerebral regions with high 5-HT6 receptor density. Binding was blocked by addition of SB258585 as a specific antagonist. Binding assays provided K-D and B-max values of respectively 1.34 nM and 0.03 pmol.mg(-1) in rat. 0.60 nM and 0.04 pmol.mg(-1) in pig, 1.38 nM and 0.07 pmo.mg(-1) in non-human primate, and 1.39 nM and 0.15 pmol.mg(-1) in human caudate nucleus. In rat brain, the proportion of unmetabolized [F-18]2FNQIP was >99% 5 min after iv injection and 89% at 40 min. The biodistribution studies found maximal radioactivity in lungs and kidneys (3.5 +/- 1.2% ID/g and 2.0 +/- 0.7% ID/g, respectively, 15 min post-injection). Conclusion: These radiopharmacological data confirm that [F-18]2FNQ1P is a specific radiotracer for molecular imaging of 5-HT6 receptors and suggest that it could be used as a radiopharmaceutical in humans.

Translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO), a putative biomarker of neuroinflammation, is quantified using positron emission tomography (PET) and C-11-PBR28, a TSPO tracer. We sought to (1) investigate TSPO binding in MDD subjects currently experiencing a major depressive episode, (2) investigate the effects of antidepressants on TSPO binding, and (3) determine the relationship of peripheral and central inflammatory markers to cerebral TSPO binding. Twenty-eight depressed MDD subjects (unmedicated (n = 12) or medicated (n = 16)) and 20 healthy controls (HC) underwent PET imaging using C-11-PBR28. Total distribution volume (V-T, proportional to Bmax/Kd) was measured and corrected with the free fraction in plasma (fp). The subgenual prefrontal cortex (sgPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) were the primary regions of interest. Peripheral blood samples and cerebrospinal fluid were analyzed to investigate the relationship between TSPO binding and peripheral and central inflammatory markers, including interleukins and neurotrophic factors previously linked to depression. Results: TSPO binding was higher in MDD versus HC in the sgPFC (Cohen's d= 0.64, p = .038, 95% CI 0.04-1.24) arid ACC (d = 0.60, p = .049, 95% CI 0.001-1.21), though these comparisons missed the corrected threshold for statistical significance (alpha = .025). Exploratory analyses demonstrated that unmedicated MDD subjects had the highest level of TSPO binding, followed by medicated MDD subjects, who did not differ from HC. TSPO binding correlated with interleukin-5 in cerebrospinal fluid but with no other central inflammatory markers. Conclusions: This study found a trend towards increased TSPO binding in the brains of MDD subjects, and post hoc analysis extended these findings by demonstrating that this abnormality is significant in unmedicated (but not medicated) MDD subjects.

Time of day but not aging regulates 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor binding sites in the hamster hippocampus	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						5-HT7 receptors; Serotonin receptors; Hippocampus; Aging; Daily rhythms	SPATIAL MEMORY; SLOW AFTERHYPERPOLARIZATION; SEROTONIN RELEASE; MESSENGER-RNA; MICE LACKING; RAT; BRAIN; EXPRESSION; SB-269970-A; MODULATION	Activation of 5-HT7 receptors influences memory as well as circadian rhythms and other processes. This study investigated the regulation of the 5-HT7 receptors in the hippocampus, a likely substrate for the effects of 5-HT7 receptor compounds on memory. Because endogenous serotonin release is higher during the active phase, and chronic treatment with a serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitor down-regulates 5-HT7 receptors, we hypothesized that 5-HT7 receptors exhibit 24-h variations. We also hypothesized that aging decreases 5-HT7 receptors in the hippocampus, as it does in the dorsal raphe nucleus, a brain site for serotonergic resetting of circadian rhythms. Male hamsters (young, 3-5 mos; old, 17-21 mos) exposed to a light:dark cycle were euthanized at 4 times of day (zeitgeber times [ZT] 1, 6, 13, & 19; ZT12 = time of lights:off). 5-HT7 receptor autoradiography was conducted on hippocampal sections using [H-3]8-0H-DPAT [2 nM] as the radioligand and SB-269970 [1 mu M] to define nonspecific binding. Slide-mounted sections and radioactive standards were apposed to X-ray films; the resultant autoradiograms were assessed by computer-assisted microdensitometry. Specific 5-HT7 receptor binding was robustly expressed in the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA1 but not in the CA2 or CA3. In the CA1 and DG, specific 5-HT7 receptor binding exhibited 24-h rhythms with troughs at night (P < 0.005; P < 0.05, respectively). Aging did not significantly affect specific 5-HT7 receptor binding in these regions, nor were significant time and age interactions observed. These findings suggest that the therapeutic effectiveness of 5-HT7 drugs may vary with time of day of administration but not with the age of the recipient.	[Duncan, Marilyn J.; Smith, J.

PET imaging of putative microglial activation in individuals at ultra-high risk for psychosis, recently diagnosed and chronically ill with schizophrenia	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTORS; RECENT-ONSET SCHIZOPHRENIA; PROTEIN 18 KDA; IN-VIVO; TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN; BINDING-SITES; HUMAN-BRAIN; TSPO; RADIOLIGAND; PHYSIOLOGY	We examined putative microglial activation as a function of illness course in schizophrenia. Microglial activity was quantified using [C-11](R)-(1-[2-chrorophynyl]-N-methyl-N-[1-methylpropyl]-3 isoquinoline carboxamide (C-11-(R)-PK11195) positron emission tomography (PET) in: (i) 10 individuals at ultra-high risk (UHR) of psychosis; (ii) 18 patients recently diagnosed with schizophrenia; (iii) 15 patients chronically ill with schizophrenia; and, (iv) 27 age-matched healthy controls. Regional-binding potential (BPND) was calculated using the simplified reference-tissue model with four alternative reference inputs. The UHR, recent-onset and chronic patient groups were compared to age-matched healthy control groups to examine between-group BPND differences in 6 regions: dorsal frontal, orbital frontal, anterior cingulate, medial temporal, thalamus and insula. Correlation analysis tested for BPND associations with gray matter volume, peripheral cytokines and clinical variables. The null hypothesis of equality in BPND between patients (UHR, recent-onset and chronic) and respective healthy control groups (younger and older) was not rejected for any group comparison or region. Across all subjects, BPND was positively correlated to age in the thalamus (r = 0.43, P = 0.008, false discovery rate). No correlations with regional gray matter, peripheral cytokine levels or clinical symptoms were detected. We therefore found no evidence of microglial activation in groups of individuals at high risk, recently diagnosed or chronically ill with schizophrenia. While the possibility of C-11-(R)- PK11195-binding differences in certain patient subgroups remains, the patient cohorts in our study, who also displayed normal peripheral cytokine profiles, do not substantiate the assumption of microglial activation in schizophrenia as a regular and defining feature, as measured by C-11-(R)-PK11195 BPND.

Only a few molecular tools, i.e., radiolabeled and fluorescent ligands, for the investigation of the Y4R were reported. Previously, [Lys(4)]hPP proved to be an appropriate full-length PP analog to prepare a fluorescent ligand by derivatization at the epsilon-amino group. To preclude oxidation upon long-term storage, we replaced the two methionine residues in [Lys(4)]hPP by norleucine and prepared the corresponding [H-3]propionylated ([H-3]12) and cyanine labeled (13) peptides, which were characterized and compared with a set of reference compounds in binding (Y-1, Y-2, Y-4, and Y-5 receptors) and functional (luciferase gene reporter, beta-arrestin-1,2) Y4R assays. Both molecular probes proved to be useful in radiochemical and flow cytometric saturation and competition Y4R binding experiments. Most strikingly, there was a different influence of the composition of buffer on equilibrium binding and kinetics: [H-3]12 affinity (K-d in Na+-free buffer: 1.1 nM) clearly decreased with increasing sodium ion concentration, whereas dissociation and Y4R-mediated internalization of 13 (K-d in Nat-free buffer: 10.8 nM) were strongly affected by the osmolarity of the buffer as demonstrated by confocal microscopy. Displacement of [H-3]12 and 13 revealed a tendency to higher apparent affinities for a set of reference peptides in hypotonic (Na+-free) compared to isotonic buffers. The differences were negligible in the case of hPP but up to 270-fold in the case of GW1229 (GR231118). By contrast, no relevant influence of Na+ on Y5R affinity became obvious, when the radioligands [H]12 and [H-3]propionyl-pNPY were investigated in saturation binding and competition binding.

Role of extracellular cysteine residues in the adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptor	PURINERGIC SIGNALLING			English	Article						A(2A) adenosine receptor; A(2B) adenosine receptor; Cysteine; Disulfide bonds; GPCR; Mutagenesis	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; SUBTYPE-SELECTIVITY; LIGAND RECOGNITION; BINDING; LOOP; AGONIST; IDENTIFICATION; DETERMINANTS; MUTAGENESIS; ANTAGONIST	The G protein-coupled A(2A) adenosine receptor represents an important drug target. Crystal structures and modeling studies indicated that three disulfide bonds are formed between ECL1 and ECL2 (I, Cys71(2.69)-Cys159(45.43); II, Cys74(3.22)-Cys146(45.30), and III, Cys77(3.25)-Cys166(45.50)). However, the A(2B)AR subtype appears to require only disulfide bond III for proper function. In this study, each of the three disulfide bonds in the A(2A)AR was disrupted by mutation of one of the cysteine residues to serine. The mutant receptors were stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and analyzed in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation and radioligand binding studies using structurally diverse agonists: adenosine, NECA, CGS21680, and PSB-15826. Results were rationalized by molecular modeling. The observed effects were dependent on the investigated agonist. Loss of disulfide bond I led to a widening of the orthosteric binding pocket resulting in a strong reduction in the potency of adenosine, but not of NECA or 2-substituted nucleosides. Disruption of disulfide bond II led to a significant reduction in the agonists' efficacy indicating its importance for receptor activation. Disulfide bond III disruption reduced potency and affinity of the small adenosine agonists and NECA, but not of the larger 2-substituted agonists. While all the three disulfide bonds were essential for high potency or efficacy of adenosine, structural modification of the nucleoside could rescue affinity or efficacy at the mutant receptors. At present, it cannot be excluded that formation of the extracellular disulfide bonds in the A(2A)AR is dynamic. This might add another level of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) modulation, in particular for the cysteine-rich A(2A) and A(2B)ARs.

A Pretargeted Approach for the Multimodal PET/NIRF Imaging of Colorectal Cancer	THERANOSTICS			English	Article						PET; fluorescence imaging; multimodal imaging; colorectal carcinoma; pretargeting; bioorthogonal; chemistry; site-specific bioconjugation	MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY A33; IN-VIVO CHEMISTRY; N-GLYCANS; PET; FLUORESCENCE; STRATEGY; CONJUGATION; EXPRESSION; CARCINOMA; RESIDUES	The complementary nature of positron emission tomography (PET) and near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging makes the development of strategies for the multimodal PET/NIRF imaging of cancer a very enticing prospect. Indeed, in the context of colorectal cancer, a single multimodal PET/NIRF imaging agent could be used to stage the disease, identify candidates for surgical intervention, and facilitate the image-guided resection of the disease. While antibodies have proven to be highly effective vectors for the delivery of radioisotopes and fluorophores to malignant tissues, the use of radioimmunoconjugates labeled with long-lived nuclides such as Zr-89 poses two important clinical complications: high radiation doses to the patient and the need for significant lag time between imaging and surgery. In vivo pretargeting strategies that decouple the targeting vector from the radioactivity at the time of injection have the potential to circumvent these issues by facilitating the use of positron-emitting radioisotopes with far shorter half-lives. Here, we report the synthesis, characterization, and in vivo validation of a pretargeted strategy for the multimodal PET and NIRF imaging of colorectal carcinoma. This approach is based on the rapid and bioorthogonal ligation between a trans-cyclooctene-and fluorophore-bearing immunoconjugate of the huA33 antibody (huA33-Dye800-TCO) and a Cu-64-labeled tetrazine radioligand (Cu-64-Tz-SarAr). In vivo imaging experiments in mice bearing A33 antigen-expressing SW1222 colorectal cancer xenografts clearly demonstrate that this approach enables the non-invasive visualization of tumors and the image-guided resection of malignant tissue, all at only a fraction of the radiation dose created by a directly labeled radioimmunoconjugate. Additional in vivo experiments in peritoneal and patient-derived xenograft models of colorectal carcinoma reinforce the efficacy of this methodology and underscore its potential as an innovative and useful clinical tool.

J	Li, HP; Qiu, HB; Wang, HQ				Li, Hong-Peng; Qiu, Hai-Bo; Wang, Hai-Qin			Effect of lipopolysaccharide on angiotensin II type 1 receptor expression and function in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells	MOLECULAR MEDICINE REPORTS			English	Article						angiotensin II; angiotensin II receptors; acute respiratory distress syndrome; acute lung injury; lipopolysaccharide	LUNG INJURY; AT(1) RECEPTOR; AT1 RECEPTOR; RAT LUNG; ACTIVATION; ENDOCYTOSIS; ANTAGONISTS; APOPTOSIS; AT(2)	Lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) are an important initiation factor in acute respiratory distress syndrome. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of LPSs on the regulation of angiotensin II (Ang II) receptors in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs). HPMECs were treated with 0, 50, 100 or 200 ng/ml LPS and incubated for 4, 8, 12 or 16 h. The expression of Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and Ang II type 2 receptor (AT2R) was determined using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. The affinity to Ang II was measured using a radioligand binding assay. No AT2R expression was detected with or without LPS administration in HPMECs, and LPS treatment increased the expression level of AT1R. A time-dependent increase of AT1R transcription was observed in the 50 ng/ml group, while in the 100 and 200 ng/ml groups, the AT1R mRNA levels reached peak values at 4 h and remained unchanged. The protein level of AT1R increased significantly in a dose-dependent manner for each incubation time period. A time-dependent increase in the protein level was observed in the 50 and 100 ng/ml groups. As for the 200 ng/ml group, the level of AT1R reached a peak value at 8 h. Maximal binding (Bmax) significantly increased following LPS treatment and Bmax of the 50 ng/ml group exhibited a time-dependent increase. The Bmax of the 100 and 200 ng/ml groups reached peak values at 12 and 8 h, respectively, and decreased thereafter. The dissociation constant remained unchanged following LPS treatment. Thus, treatment with LPS increased AT1R expression and its Bmax to Ang II in HPMECs, however, did not alter the affinity of AT1R to Ang II.

Serotonin receptors are implicated in the development of LID and modulation of basal ganglia 5-HT1B receptors is a potential therapeutic alternative in Parkinson's disease. In the present study, we used receptor-binding autoradiography of the 5-HT1B-selective radioligand [H-3]GR125743 to investigate possible contributions of changes in ligand binding of this receptor in LID in post-mortem brain specimens from Parkinson's disease patients (n = 14) and control subjects (n = 11), and from 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned monkeys treated with saline (n = 5), L-DOPA (n = 4) or L-DOPA + 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl) pyridine (MPEP) (n = 5), and control monkeys (n = 4). MPEP is the prototypal metabotropic glutamate 5 (mG1u5) receptor antagonist and has been shown to reduce the development of LID in these monkeys in a chronic treatment of one month. [H-3]GR125743 specific binding to striatal and pallidal 5-HT1B receptors respectively were only increased in L-DOPA-treated MPTP monkeys (dyskinetic monkeys) as compared to controls, saline and L-DOPA + MPEP MPTP monkeys; dyskinesias scores correlated positively with this binding. Parkinson's disease patients with motor complications (L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias and wearing-off) had higher [H-3]GR125743 specific binding compared to those without motor complications and controls in the basal ganglia. Reduction of motor complications was associated with normal striatal 5-HT1B receptors, suggesting the potential of this receptor for the management of motor complications in Parkinson's disease.

Label-free detection of small-molecule binding to a GPCR in the membrane environment	BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-PROTEINS AND PROTEOMICS			English	Article						Surface acoustic wave; Surface plasmon resonance; Label-free interaction; CXCR4; Small molecule; Lipoparticle	BICYCLAM NONPEPTIDE ANTAGONISTS; CXCR4 CHEMOKINE RECEPTOR; RESIDENCE TIME; PROTEIN INTERACTIONS; OPTICAL BIOSENSORS; DRUG DISCOVERY; LIGAND; MECHANISM	Evaluation of drug target interaction kinetics is becoming increasingly important during the drug-discovery process to investigate selectivity of a drug and predict in vivo target occupancy. To date, it remains challenging to obtain kinetic information for interactions between G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and small-molecule ligands in a label-free manner. Often GPCRs need to be solubilized or even stabilized by mutations which can be difficult and is time consuming. In addition, it is often unclear if the native conformation of the receptors is sustained. In this study, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and surface acoustic wave (SAW) technologies have been used to detect ligand binding to the GPCR chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) expressed in lipoparticles. We first evaluated different strategies to immobilize CXCR4-expressing lipoparticles. The highest small-molecule binding signal in SPR and SAW was achieved with a matrix-free carboxymethylated sensor chip coated with wheat germ agglutinin for lipoparticle capturing. Next, the binding kinetics of the anti-CXCR4 antibody 12G5 raised against a conformational epitope (I-con = 1.83 x 10(6) M(-1)s(-1), k(off) = 2.79 x 10(-4) s(-1)) and the small molecule AMD3100 (k(on) = 5.46 x 10(5) M(-1)s(-1), k(off) = 1.01 x 10(-2) s(-1)) were assessed by SAW. Our kinetic and affinity data are consistent with previously published radioligand-binding experiments using cells and label-free experiments with solubilized CXCR4. This is the first study demonstrating label-free kinetic characterization of small-molecule binding to a GPCR in the membrane environment. The presented method holds the potential to greatly facilitate label-free assay development for GPRCs that can be expressed at high levels in lipoparticles. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Evidence for brain glial activation in chronic pain patients	BRAIN			English	Article						chronic pain; C-11-PBR28; translocator protein (18kDa); TSPO; neuroinflammation; glia	PROTEIN 18 KDA; PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; LOW-DOSE NALTREXONE; IN-VITRO EVIDENCE; TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN; SPINAL-CORD; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; DIFFERENTIAL RESPONSES	Although substantial evidence has established that microglia and astrocytes play a key role in the establishment and maintenance of persistent pain in animal models, the role of glial cells in human pain disorders remains unknown. Here, using the novel technology of integrated positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging and the recently developed radioligand C-11-PBR28, we show increased brain levels of the translocator protein (TSPO), a marker of glial activation, in patients with chronic low back pain. As the Ala147Thr polymorphism in the TSPO gene affects binding affinity for C-11-PBR28, nine patient-control pairs were identified from a larger sample of subjects screened and genotyped, and compared in a matched-pairs design, in which each patient was matched to a TSPO polymorphism-, age-and sex-matched control subject (seven Ala/Ala and two Ala/Thr, five males and four females in each group; median age difference: 1 year; age range: 29-63 for patients and 28-65 for controls). Standardized uptake values normalized to whole brain were significantly higher in patients than controls in multiple brain regions, including thalamus and the putative somatosensory representations of the lumbar spine and leg. The thalamic levels of TSPO were negatively correlated with clinical pain and circulating levels of the proinflammatory citokine interleukin-6, suggesting that TSPO expression exerts pain-protective/anti-inflammatory effects in humans, as predicted by animal studies. Given the putative role of activated glia in the establishment and or maintenance of persistent pain, the present findings offer clinical implications that may serve to guide future studies of the pathophysiology and management of a variety of persistent pain conditions.

Methylmercruy (MeHg) is a known neurotoxicant, yet little is known about the risk of exposure for beluga whales. Selenium (Se) has been linked to demethylation of MeHg in cetaceans, but its role in attenuating Hg toxicity in beluga whales is poorly understood. The objective of this study is to explore relationships between Hg and Se concentrations and neurochemical biomarkers in different brain regions of beluga whales in order to assess potential neurotoxicological risk of Hg exposure in this population. Brain tissue was sampled from hunter-harvested beluga whales from the western Canadian Arctic in 2008 and 2010. Neurochemical and molecular biomarkers were measured with radioligand binding assays and quantitative PCR, respectively. Total Hg (Hg-T) concentration ranged from 2.6-113 mg kg(-1) dw in temporal cortex. Gamma-amminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA(A)-R) binding in the cerebellum was negatively associated with Hg-T, MeHg and total Se (Se-T) concentrations (p <= 0.05). The expression of mRNA for GABA(A)-R subunit alpha 2 was negatively associated with Hg-T and MeHg (p <= 0.05). Furthermore, GABA(A)-R binding was positively correlated to mRNA expression for GABA(A)-R alpha 2 subunit, and negatively correlated to the expression of mRNA for GABA(A)-R a4 subunit (p <= 0.05). The expression of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) subunit 2b mRNA expression was negatively associated with iHglabile concentration in the cerebellum (p <= 0.05). Variation of molecular and/or biochemical components of the GABAergic and glutamatergic signaling pathways were associated with MeHg exposure in beluga whales. Our results show that MeHg exposure is associated with neurochemical variation in the cerebellum of beluga whales and Se may partially protect from MeHg-associated neurotoxicity.

It also exhibits both reversible and wash-resistant binding to and activation of these receptors. So far the mechanisms of xanomeline selectivity remain unknown. To address this question we employed microfluorometric measurements of intracellular calcium levels and radioligand binding to investigate differences in the short-and long-term effects of xanomeline among muscarinic receptors expressed individually in Chinese hamster ovary cells. 1/One-min exposure of cells to xanomeline markedly increased intracellular calcium at hM(1) and hM(4), and to a lesser extent at hM(2) and hM(3) muscarinic receptors for more than 1 hour. 2/Unlike the classic agonists carbachol, oxotremorine, and pilocarpine 10-min exposure to xanomeline did not cause internalization of any receptor subtype. 3/Wash-resistant xanomeline selectively prevented further increase in intracellular calcium by carbachol at hM(1) and hM(4) receptors. 4/After transient activation xanomeline behaved as a long-term antagonist at hM(5) receptors. 5/The antagonist N-methylscopolamine (NMS) reversibly blocked activation of hM(1) through hM(4) receptors by xanomeline. 6/NMS prevented formation of xanomeline wash-resistant binding and activation at hM(2) and hM(4) receptors and slowed them at hM(1), hM(3) and hM(5) receptors. Our results show commonalities of xanomeline reversible and wash-resistant binding and short-time activation among the five muscarinic receptor subtypes. However long-term receptor activation takes place in full only at hM(1) and hM(4) receptors. Moreover xanomeline displays higher efficacy at hM(1) and hM(4) receptors in primary phasic intracellular calcium release. These findings suggest the existence of particular activation mechanisms specific to these two receptors.

One of the most frequent chronic pain sensations people experience is associated with pathological conditions of the musculoskeletal system. Chronic musculoskeletal pain is a major health problem, and an adequate management requires understanding of both peripheral and central components, with more attention drawn to the former. Intense experimental and clinical research activities resulted in important knowledge on the mechanisms and functions of the endogenous opioid system located in the periphery. This review describes the occurrence and distribution of endogenous opioids and their receptors in the musculoskeletal system, and their role in pain control in musculoskeletal disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Using different techniques, including immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy or radioimmunoassay, expression of enkephalins, dynorphin, beta-endorphin, and endomorphins was demonstrated in musculoskeletal tissues of animals and humans. Localization of opioid peptides was found in synovial membrane, periosteum, bone and bone marrow, loose connective tissue, the paratenon and musculotendinous junction of the achilles tendon. Animal and human studies have also demonstrated expression of mu, delta and kappa opioid receptor proteins in musculoskeletal tissues using radioligand binding assays, autoradiography, electrophysiology, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Opioid receptor gene expression was reported based on polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization techniques. Combining morphological and quantitative approaches, important evidence that the musculoskeletal apparatus is equipped with a peripheral opioid system is provided. Demonstration of the occurrence of an endogenous opioid system in bone and joint tissues represents an essential step for defining novel pharmacological strategies to attain peripheral control of pain in musculoskeletal disorders.

For visualization of NET availability and occupancy in the human brain PET imaging can be used. Therefore, selective NET-PET tracers with high affinity are required. Amongst these, [F-18]FMeNER-D2 is showing the best results so far. Furthermore, a reliable fully automated radiosynthesis is a prerequisite for successful application of PET-tracers. The aim of this work was the automation of [F-18]FMeNER-D2 radiolabelling for subsequent clinical use. The presented study comprises 25 automated large-scale syntheses, which were directly applied to healthy volunteers and adult patients suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Procedures: Synthesis of [F-18]FMeNER-D2 was automated within a Nuclear Interface Module. Starting from 20-30 GBq [F-18]fluoride, azeotropic drying, reaction with Br2CD2, distillation of 1-bromo-2-[F-18]fluoromethane-D2 ([F-18] BFM) and reaction of the pure [F-18]BFM with unprotected precursor NER were optimized and completely automated.

Radiochemical synthesis and <i>in vivo</i> evaluation of [<SUP>18</SUP>F]AZ11637326: An agonist probe for the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Spirofuropyridine; PET; Molecular imaging; Brain; Radiopharmaceutical	LIGAND; BIODISTRIBUTION; RADIOLIGANDS; DISCOVERY; MODELS; TARGET; ANALOG	Introduction: The alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha 7 nAChR) is key in brain communication and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of diseases of the central nervous system. A positron-emitting radioligand targeting the alpha 7 nAChR would enable better understanding of a variety of neuropsychiatric illnesses, including schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease, and could enhance the development of new drugs for these and other conditions. We describe our attempt to synthesize an alpha 7 nAChR-selective radiotracer for positron emission tomography (PET). Methods: We prepared the high-affinity (K-d = 0.2 nM) alpha 7 nAChR agonist, 5'-(2-[F-18]fluorophenyl)spiro[1-azabicyclo-[2.2.2]octane]-3,2'-(3'H)furo[2,3-b]pyridine, [F-18]AZ11637326, in two steps, a nucleophilic fluorination followed by decarbonylation. We studied [F-18]AZ11637326 in rodents, including mice lacking alpha 7 nAChR, and in non-human primates. Results: [F-18]AZ11637326 was synthesized in a non-decay-corrected radiochemical yield of 3% from the end of synthesis (90 min) with a radiochemical purity >90% and average specific radioactivity of 140 GBq/mu mol (3,781 mCi/mu mol). Modest rodent brain uptake was observed (2-5% injected dose per gram of tissue, depending on specific activity), with studies comparing CD-1 and alpha 7 nAChR null mice indicating an element of target-specific binding. Blocking studies in non-human primates did not reveal specific binding within the brain. Conclusion: Despite the high affinity and target selectivity of AZ11637326 for alpha 7 nAChR in vitro and encouraging rodent studies, receptor-mediated binding could not be demonstrated in non-human primates. Further structural optimization of compounds of this class will be required for them to serve as suitable radiotracers for PET. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

More recently, the radioiodinated (R,S)-stereoisomer of 123I-INER, 123I-NKJ64, has been synthesized and preliminary evaluation in rats has been reported. This article reports the brain distribution and pharmacokinetic properties of 123I-NKJ64 in baboons and compares results with 123I-INER data in the same species. SPECT studies were conducted in two ovariectomized adult female baboons using two different protocols: (1) bolus of 123I-INER or 123I-NKJ64; and (2) bolus plus constant infusion of 123I-NKJ64 with reboxetine (2.0 mg/kg) administration at equilibrium. Following bolus injection, both radiotracers rapidly and avidly entered the baboon brain. The regional brain accumulation of 123I-NKJ64 did not match the known distribution of NAT in baboon brain, contrasting with previous results obtained in rats. Conversely, the regional distribution of 123I-INER was consistent with known distribution of NAT in baboon brain. No displacement of 123I-NKJ64 was observed following administration of reboxetine. This contrasts with previous data obtained for 123I-INER, where 60% of specific binding was displaced by a lower dose of reboxetine. These data suggest that 123I-NKJ64 may lack affinity and selectivity for NAT in baboon brain and 123I-INER is the most promising iodinated reboxetine analogue developed to date for in vivo imaging of NAT in brain using SPECT. This study highlights the importance of species differences during radiotracer development and the stereochemical configuration of analogues of reboxetine in vivo. Synapse 66:923930, 2012.

Binding and activity of the prostacyclin receptor (IP) agonists, treprostinil and iloprost, at human prostanoid receptors: Treprostinil is a potent DP<sub>1</sub> and EP<sub>2</sub> agonist	BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Prostacyclin analogues; Radioligand binding; Cyclic AMP; Calcium influx; Prostanoid receptors	PULMONARY-ARTERIAL-HYPERTENSION; SMOOTH-MUSCLE PROLIFERATION; MEDIATED VASODILATATION; INTERNATIONAL UNION; PROSTAGLANDIN E-2; BERAPROST SODIUM; LIGAND-BINDING; ANALOGS; CLASSIFICATION; PHARMACOLOGY	The prostacyclin analogues, iloprost and treprostinil are extensively used in treating pulmonary hypertension. Their binding profile and corresponding biochemical cellular responses on human prostanoid receptors expressed in cell lines, have now been compared. Iloprost had high binding affinity for EP1 and IP receptors (K-i 1.1 and 3.9 nM, respectively), low affinity for FP, EP3 or EP4 receptors, and very low affinity for EP2, DP1 or TP receptors. By contrast, treprostinil had high affinity for the DP1, EP2 and IP receptors (K(i)4.4,3.6 and 32 nM, respectively), low affinity for EP1 and EP4 receptors and even lower affinity for EP3, FP and TP receptors. In functional assays, iloprost had similar high activity in elevating cyclic AMP levels in cells expressing the human IP receptor and stimulating calcium influx in cells expressing EP1 receptors (EC50 0.37 and 0.3 nM, respectively) with the rank order of activity on the other receptors comparable to the binding assays. As with binding studies, treprostinil elevated cyclic AMP with a similar high potency in cells expressing DP1, IP and EP2 receptors (EC50 0.6, 1.9 and 6.2 nM, respectively), but had low activity at the other receptors. Activation of IP, DP1 and EP2 receptors, as with treprostinil, can all result in vasodilatation of human pulmonary arteries. However, activation of EP1 receptors can provoke vasoconstriction, and hence may offset the IP-receptor mediated vasodilator effects of iloprost. Treprostinil may therefore differ from iloprost in its overall beneficial pulmonary vasorelaxant profile and other pharmacological actions, especially in diseases where the IP receptor is down-regulated.

Extensive structure-activity relationship studies have revealed several regions of the molecule that can be altered without loss of activity. The most potent synthetic dictyostatin analogue described to date, 6-epi-dictyostatin, has superior in vivo antitumor activity against human breast cancer xenografts compared with paclitaxel. In spite of their encouraging activities in preclinical studies, the complex chemical structure of the dictyostatins presents a major obstacle for their development into novel antineoplastic therapies. We recently reported a streamlined synthesis of 16-desmethyl-25,26-dihydrodictyostatins and found several agents that, when compared with 6-epi-dictyostatin, retained nanomolar activity in cellular microtubule-bundling assays but had lost activity against paclitaxel-resistant cells with mutations in beta-tubulin. Extending these studies, we applied the new, highly convergent synthesis to generate 25,26-dihydrodictyostatin and 6-epi-25,26-dihydrodictyostatin. Both compounds were potent microtubule-perturbing agents that induced mitotic arrest and microtubule assembly in vitro and in intact cells. In vitro radioligand binding studies showed that 25,26-dihydrodictyostatin and its C6-epimer were capable of displacing [(3)H] paclitaxel and [(14)C] epothilone B from microtubules with potencies comparable to (-)-dictyostatin and discodermolide. Both compounds inhibited the growth of paclitaxel-and epothilone B-resistant cell lines at low nanomolar concentrations, synergized with paclitaxel in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells, and had antiangiogenic activity in transgenic zebrafish larvae. These data identify 25,26-dihydrodictyostatin and 6-epi-25,26-dihydrodictyostatin as candidates for scale-up synthesis and further preclinical development. Mol Cancer Ther; 10(6); 994-1006.

Ginkgolide B and bilobalide block the pore of the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor at a location that overlaps the picrotoxin binding site	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Serotonin; Cys-loop; Picrotoxin; Antagonist; Channel	MOLECULAR DETERMINANTS; CHANNEL BLOCKERS; GABA(A); ANTAGONISM; STOICHIOMETRY; SENSITIVITY; MECHANISM	Extracts from the Ginkgo biloba tree are widely used as herbal medicines, and include bilobalide (BB) and ginkgolides A and B (GA and GB). Here we examine their effects on human 5-HT(3)A and 5-HT(3)AB receptors, and compare these to the effects of the structurally related compounds picrotin (PTN) and picrotoxinin (PXN), the two components of picrotoxin (PTX), a known channel blocker of 5-HT3, nACh and GABA(A) receptors. The compounds inhibited 5-HT-induced responses of 5-HT3 receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes, with IC50 values of 470 mu M (BB), 730 mu M (GB), 470 mu M (PTN), 11 mu M (PXN) and > 1 mM (GA) in 5-HT(3)A receptors, and 3.1 mM (BB), 3.9 mM (GB), 2.7 mM (PTN), 62 mu M (PXN) and > 1 mM (GA) in 5-HT(3)AB receptors. Radioligand binding on receptors expressed in HEK 293 cells showed none of the compounds displaced the specific 5-HT3 receptor antagonist [H-3]granisetron, confirming that they do not act at the agonist binding site. Inhibition by GB at 5-HT(3)A receptors is weakly use-dependent, and recovery is activity dependent, indicating channel block. To further probe their site of action at 5-HT(3)A receptors, BB and GB were applied alone or in combination with PXN, and the results fitted to a mathematical model; the data revealed partially overlapping sites of action. We conclude that BB and GB block the channel of the 5-HT(3)A receptor. Thus these compounds have comparable, although less potent, behaviour than at some other Cys-loop receptors, demonstrating their actions are conserved across the family.

The presence of ZnT8Ab after diagnosis has not been investigated. This study analyzed the autoantibody response to ZnT8 in regard to age at onset and disease duration. Two new onset type 1 diabetes patient cohorts with different age distributions at onset (2-17 and 15-34 years of age at onset), a longitudinal subset of the younger type 1 diabetes patient cohort (n = 32), and a cohort of GAD65Ab-positive LADA patients (n = 47) was analyzed for the presence of autoantibodies directed to the two major isoforms, ZnT8-Arginine (ZnT8R) and ZnT8-Tryptophan (ZnT8W). The majority of type 1 diabetes patients tested positive for ZnT8Ab to both isoforms. ZnT8Ab titers were significantly higher in the younger type 1 diabetes patients as compared with the older cohort (ZnT8RAb at a median of 148 and 29 U/ml, respectively, p < 0.001) (ZnT8WAb at a median of 145 and 58 U/ml, respectively, p < 0.01). ZnT8RAb and ZnT8WAb titers were significantly lower in the LADA patients (ZnT8RAb at a median of 14 U/ml, ZnT8WAb at a median of 25 U/ml) as compared with either type 1 diabetes cohorts. In our longitudinal analysis of type 1 diabetes patients after clinical diagnosis, ZnT8Ab levels to both isoforms declined significantly during the initial year of disease (ZnT8RAb from a median of 320-162 U/ml, p = 0.0001; ZnT8WAb from a median of 128-46 U/ml, p = 0.0011). The antibody titers further declined during the following 4 years (p < 0.0001). We conclude that ZnT8Ab presents a useful marker for type 1 diabetes, especially in younger patients at disease diagnosis.

Methods: CHO cells stably expressing HA-tagged A(1)R and DOR-CFP fusion protein were used. The localization of receptors was observed using confocal microscope. DOR-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase was measured using cyclic AMP assay. Western blots were employed to detect the phosphorylation of Akt and the DOR. The effect of A(1)R agonist N-6-cyclohexyladenosine (CHA) on DOR down-regulation was assessed using radioligand binding assay. Results: CHA 1 mu mol/L time-dependently attenuated DOR agonist [D-Pen(2,5)] enkephalin (DPDPE)-induced inhibition of intracellular cAMP accumulation with a t(1/2)=2.56 (2.09-3.31) h. Pretreatment with 1 mu mol/L CHA for 24 h caused a right shift of the dose-response curve of DPDPE-mediated inhibition of cAMP accumulation, with a significant increase in EC50 but no change in E-max. Pretreatment with 1 mu mol/L CHA for 1 h also induced a significant attenuation of DPDPE-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt. Moreover, CHA time-dependently phosphorylated DOR (Ser363), and this effect was inhibited by A(1)R antagonist 1,3-Dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX) but not by DOR antagonist naloxone. However, CHA failed to produce the down-regulation of DOR, as neither receptor affinity (K-d) nor receptor density (B-max) of DOR showed significant change after chronic CHA exposure. Conclusion: Activation of A(1)R by its agonist caused heterologous desensitization of DOR-mediated inhibition of intracellular cAMP accumulation and phosphorylation of Akt. Activation of A(1)R by its agonist also induced heterologous phosphorylation but not down-regulation of DOR.

In intact human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells expressing the wild-type (WT) or the variant receptor, the function was analyzed by indirect measurement of agonist-induced Ca2+ current through the 5-HT3A receptor channel by an aequorm luminescence-based Ca2+ assay. In cell membrane patches cation currents were determined electrophysiologically including technically demanding single channel analyses The pharmacological properties were analyzed by [H-3]GR65630 binding to cell membrane fragments The density of [H-3]GR65630 binding sites in cells expressing the variant receptor was reduced to 55% of that in cells expressing the WT receptor, which, however, was not accompanied by an analogous decrease in 5-HT-induced Ca2+ influx through the receptor channel However, the single channel analysis Suggests an increase in single receptor channel mean open time (which is known to be subject of many variables) but not in unitary current amplitude. Radioligand competition experiments revealed that the affinity of five 5-HT3 receptor agonists and four antagonists for the variant receptor did not differ from that for the WT receptor In conclusion, the variant receptor resembles the WT receptor in that it Forms functional homopentameric 5-HT3A receptors with identical pharmacological properties. In view of the lack of reduction In Ca2+ flux through the variant receptor channels in spite of the decrease in its density on the cell membrane, the increase in single receptor channel mean open time appears to compensate for the reduction in variant receptor density.

The dopamine D-3 receptors have high-affinity for agonist (eg dopamine) and the existence of the two affinity states is controversial. Although preclinical studies in animal models of psychosis have shown a selective increase of D-2(high) as the common pathway to psychosis, the D-3 has been suggested to be involved in the pathophysiology of psychosis. We report the first study of the D-2(high) and D-3 in schizophrenia using the novel PET radiotracer, [C-11]-(+)- PHNO. We recruited 13 patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorder amidst an acute psychotic episode, drug free for at least 2 weeks, and 13 age - sex-matched healthy controls. The binding potential no-displaceable (BPND) was examine in the main regions of interest (caudate, putamen, ventral striatum, globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and anterior thalamus) and in a voxel-wise analysis. The BPND between patients and controls was not different in any of the regions. The voxel-wise analysis did not reveal any difference and no correlations were found between the BPND and positive and negative syndrome scale subscales. Our results do not find support for the hypothesis linking psychosis to a selective increase in D-2(high) and/or D-3 in schizophrenia. It is possible that receptors with high affinity are not accessible by [C-11]-(+)-PHNO because they are occupied by endogenous dopamine, a possibility that can be ruled out in future experiments.

However, their phenotypes are not always confirmatory to results obtained by pharmacological investigations in vivo or in vitro. These discrepancies may, at least in part, be due to compensatory changes in the expression of remaining Y-receptor types. To determine whether deletion of individual Y-receptors results in altered mRNA expression and/or binding toward other Y-receptor types, we applied in-situ hybridization and radioligand-binding studies on brain slices of Npy1r-, Npy2r- or Npy5r-knockout mice. Significant changes were seen in Y1-receptor-deficient mice. Thus, Y2-receptor mRNA and I-125-peptide YY3-36 binding in the hippocampus proper were increased by up to 55% and 89%, respectively. Similar increases in I-125-peptide YY3-36 binding were observed in the caudo-dorsal extension of the lateral septum, an area heavily targeted by hippocampal projections and involved in Y1-receptor-regulated anxiety. Increased I-125- peptide YY3-36 binding and Y2-receptor mRNA levels were also observed in the medial amygdaloid nucleus. In contrast, I-125- peptide YY3-36 binding was reduced in the central amygdaloid nucleus. Y2-receptor mRNA in the intermediate part of the lateral septum was reduced by 42%. Only minimal changes were observed in Y2- or Y5-receptor-deficient mice. Our results demonstrate that compensatory changes in the expression of Y2-receptors occur in Y1-receptor-deficient mice. These adaptations are likely to contribute to changed physiological function. Thus, alterations in Y2-receptors have to be taken in account upon discussion of Y1-receptor function, especially in emotional aspects like anxiety and aggression, but also alcoholism.

These ligand bindings were determined at 3 and 24 h and at 3 and 7 days after ischemia/reperfusion of MCA by using autoradiographic methods. Ischemic cell injury was clearly detected from 3 h after ischemia/reperfusion and progressively increased from 3-24 h after ischemia/reperfusion of MCA. The area of cell injury reached maximum at 24 h after ischemia/reperfusion of MCA. [H-3]-SCH23390 binding was reduced to 47% of the contralateral side at 3 days after ischemia/reperfusion of MCA. After 7 days, [H-3] -SCH23390 binding was further reduced by 20% in the striatum. [H-3] -NMPB binding was slightly decreased in both the striatum and cerebral cortex at 3 days after ischemia/reperfusion of MCA, and [3H]-NMPB binding in the striatum and cerebral cortex were reduced to 42 and 62% of the contralateral side at 7 days after ischemia/reperfusion of MCA. [H-3]-NMPB was also decreased at 24 h. In contrast, [H-3]-flumazenil binding was not decreased in the striatum and cerebral cortex within 7 days after ischemia/reperfusion of MCA. These results suggest that [H-3]-SCH23390 and [H-3]- NMPB binding do not correlate with cell injury by ischemia/reperfusion, although vulnerability to ischemia/reperfusion was observed with these receptors. In addition, central benzodiazepine receptor imaging might be essentially stable to neuronal cell injury induced by transient focal cerebral ischemia in rats, in contrast to the results of PET studies.

We evaluated its potential to detect abnormalities in serotonergic function in the rat using 1) a model of serotonergic neuron lesion induced with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT), and 2) experimental induction of acute decrease in endogenous brain serotonin levels. Cerebral biodistribution studies of [I-125]ADAM were performed in normal conditions, in 5,7-DHT-lesioned rats, and after acute serotonin depletion obtained with p-chlorophenylalanine (pCPA). Around 50% reduction in accumulation of ADAM was observed in the hypothalamus and hippocampus 3 weeks after lesion of serotonergic neurons, whereas a more modest decrease of 15-30% occurred in the thalamus, frontal cortex, and striatum. This demonstrated the ability of the tracer to detect serotonergic neuron loss in vivo. After inducing acute 5-HT depletion with pCPA, we observed an increase in in vivo [I-125]ADAM binding in all brain areas studied. The higher in vivo binding of [I-125]ADAM in pCPA-treated rats than in controls was mainly due to an increase in specific binding to the SERT, as demonstrated by greatly reduced binding in the presence of a saturating dose of paroxetine. This may indicate in vivo competition between ADAM and 5-HT for binding to the SERT. The present findings thus demonstrate that ADAM is a specific SERT radioligand which can be used for in vivo study of central serotonin systems, and supports its use as a tracer for SPECT studies in human disorders involving dysfunction of serotonergic neurotransmission.

Currently, ligand interactions with the A(1)-AR can be quantified on large cell populations only by using radioligand binding. To increase the resolution of these measurements, we have designed and characterized a previously undescribed fluorescent antagonist for the A(1)-AR, XAC-BY630, based on xanthine amine congener (XAC). This compound has been used to quantify ligand-receptor binding at a single cell level using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). XAC-BY630 was a competitive antagonist of A(1)-AR-mediated inhibition of cAMP accumulation [log(10) of the affinity constant (pK(b)) = 6.7)] and stimulation of inositol phosphate accumulation (pK(b) = 6.5). Specific binding of XAC-BY630 to cell surface A(1)-AR could also be visualized in living Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-A1 cells by using confocal microscopy. FCS analysis of XAC-BY630 binding to the membrane of CHO-A1 cells revealed three components with diffusion times (tau(D)) of 62 mus (tau(D1), free ligand), 17 ms (tau(D2), A(1)-AR-ligand), and 320 MS (tau(D3)). Confirmation that tau(D2) resulted from diffusion of ligand-receptor complexes came from the similar diffusion time observed for the fluorescent A(1)-AR-Topaz fusion protein (15 ms). Quantification of tau(D2) showed that the number of receptor-ligand complexes increased with increasing free ligand concentration and was decreased by the selective A(1)-AR antagonist, 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine. The combination of FCS with XAC-BY630 will be a powerful tool for the characterization of ligand-A(1)-AR interactions in single living cells in health and disease.

In radioligand binding experiments, mexiletine (10 muM-1 mM) concentration-dependently displaced the specific binding of[I-125]cyanopindolol to human beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors in the membrane fraction of the cells. High concentration (100 muM-1 mM) of mexiletine partially displaced the specific binding of [I-125]cyanopindolol to human beta(3)-adrenoceptor. On the other hand, high concentration (300 muM and 1 mM) of lidocaine, another class Ib antiarrhythmic drug, partially displaced the specific binding of [I-125]cyanopindolol to human PI-adrenoceptor, whereas it did not affect the specific binding of [I-125]cyanopindolol to human beta(2)- and beta(3)-adrenoceptors. Mexiletine(5, 50, and 500 muM) reduces basal adenosine 3',5-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) level and isoprenaline-induced cAMP accumulation on CHO cells stably expressing cloned human beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors. Lidocaine (10 and 100 muM and I mM) tend to reduce basal cAMP level on CHO cells stably expressing cloned human beta(1)-adrenoceptors, whereas the drug did not reduce the isoprenaline-induced cAMP accumulation on CHO cells stably expressing cloned human beta(1)-, beta(2)-, and beta(3)-adrenoceptors. Mexiletine and lidocaine have no effect on forskolin (0.1, 1, and 3 muM)-induced cAMP accumulation. These results demonstrate that mexiletine blocks the binding of agonists to beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors, and thereby attenuates the agonist-induced cAMP accumulation, and that the action of mexiletine as an antagonist of beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors is independent of its antiarrhythmic property.

Limited studies suggest that these wastes may contain a variety of endocrine-disrupting Compounds (EDCs) that may be released into aquatic environments through runoff. The purpose of this Study was to apply a toxicity identification and evaluation approach to isolate and identify estrogenic compounds in hog manure. A recombinant yeast estrogen screen bioassay was used to detect estrogenicity of high-performance liquid chromatography-separated hog manure fractions. Further analytical analyses of the fractions and comparison to authentic standards resulted in the identification of the endogenous estrogens 17beta-estradiol (E-2) and estrone, and the phytoestrogen metabolite, equol. High levels of equol (6.9-16.6 ppm) were found to be present in manure that was stored for several months. The endocrine-disrupting potential of equol was characterized further by using fish hormone estrogen receptor (ER), sex hormone binding protein (SSBP), and goldfish androgen receptor (AR) radioligand binding assays. Equol was found to be approximately 1,000- and 200-fold less potent that E-2 in competing for binding sites of the SSBP and ER. respectively. Equol's potency was 2,200-fold less than testosterone for the AR. Additional Studies confirmed the presence of compounds with estrogenic activity in tile drain water after application of hog manure to an agriculture field. In this case, the contribution of equol to the total estrogenicity of the tile drain water was minimal relative to that of natural estrogens. Overall, this study indicates that further work is warranted to assess the impact that EDCs that originate front agricultural runoff may have on the ecology or physiology of exposed biota.

J	Lei, BL; Zhang, YY; Han, CD				Lei, BL; Zhang, YY; Han, CD			Changes in mRNA expression induced by sustained noradrenaline stimulation are different for α<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor subtypes in HEK293 cells	CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PHARMACOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						alpha(1)-adrenoceptor; mRNA expression; noradrenaline; regulation; signal transduction	VASCULAR SMOOTH-MUSCLE; RECEPTOR MESSENGER-RNA; ALPHA-1-ADRENERGIC RECEPTOR; MEDIATED REGULATION; MOLECULAR-CLONING; DOWN-REGULATION; CDNA; AGONIST	1. The aim of the present study was to investigate noradrenaline (NA)-induced regulation of alpha(1) -adrenoceptor (AR) mRNA expression in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells stably expressing cloned alpha(1) -AR subtypes with similar receptor densities. Stable transfection was performed by calcium phosphate precipitation. Receptor expression was detected by radioligand binding assay. The mRNA expression was measured by RNase protection assay. 2. alpha(1) -Adrenoceptor subtype mRNA respond in distinct ways following prolonged exposure to NA. The mRNA level of the alpha(1A) -AR subtype was unchanged, the mRNA level of the alpha(1B) -AR subtype was increased and the mRNA level of the alpha(1D) -AR subtype declined time dependently. The protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor calphostin C or RO 31-8220 abolished the NA-induced downregulation of alpha(1D) -AR mRNA. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), a PKC activator, similarly repressed the effects of NA on alpha(1D) -AR. However, calphostin C, RO 31-8220 or PMA had no effect on the induction of alpha(1B) -AR mRNA by NA. The Ca2+ -ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin or the calcium chelator 1,2-bis-(o -aminophenoxy) ethane-N ,N ,N ',N '-tetraacetic acid tetra (acetoxymethyl) ester (BAPTA/AM) had no effect on the repression of alpha(1D) -AR mRNA, but did inhibit the induction of alpha(1B) -AR mRNA by NA. Noradrenaline significantly decelerated the degradation of alpha(1B) -AR mRNA, but had no effect on the degradation of alpha(1D) -AR mRNA. 3. Thus, the mRNA expression of three alpha(1) -AR subtypes in HEK293 cells is differentially regulated through distinct signal transduction pathways under sustained NA stimulation. The upregulation of alpha(1B) -AR mRNA is via the Ca2+ pathway, whereas the downregulation of alpha(1D) -AR mRNA is via the PKC pathway.

TDIQ or 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-1,3-dioxolo[4,5-g]isoquinoline, is a conformationally constrained phenylalkylamine that serves as a discriminative stimulus in animals. Although TDIQ bears structural resemblance to phenylalkylamine stimulants (e.g., amphetamine), hallucinogens aminopropane [MDMA], N-methyl-1-(4-methoxphenyl)-2-aminopropane [PMMA]), the TDIQ stimulus failed to generalize to (+)amphetamine or MDMA. In the present investigation, further evaluations were made to the stimulus nature of TDIQ. Specifically, the stimulus similarities of TDIQ, PMMA, and DOM were examined. In no case was stimulus generalization(substitution) observed. The results confirm that TDIQ produces stimulus effects distinct from those of the obovementioned phenylalkyamines. We also examined the structure-activity relationships of a series of TDIQ analogs, including several that might be viewed as conformationally restricted (CR) analogs of phenylalkylamine hallucinogens, stimulants, and designer drugs. These agents were examined in rats trained to discriminate either DOM (1.0 mg/kg), (+)amphetamine(1.0 mg/kg), MDMA (1.5 mg/kg), or TDIQ (5.0 mg/kg) from saline vehicle. Whereas we have demonstrated that none of these agents retains their respective phenylalkylamine stimulus actions, several of these agents were found to substitute for TDIQ. N-Methylation abolished TDIQ-stimulus action. These results, coupled with previous findings, imply that TDIQ derivatives represent a novel class of phenylalkylamines analogs with unique stimulus properties. Preliminary radioligand binding studies suggest that an alpha(2)-adrenergic mechanism might underlie the stimulus effects produced by TDIQ. (C) Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

This also holds true for radioligand binding assays with or without guanine nucleotide guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p). 5 Although all studied beta -adrenoceptor antagonists lack intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), they differ in the beta (1)-selectivity as well as in their direct negative inotropic action. These differences as well as the mode of extracardiac action may have an impact on outcome of patients treated with beta -adrenoceptor antagonists.

In the present study, we showed that in membranes of rat frontal cortex the GABA(B) receptor agonist (-)baclofen increased basal adenylyl cyclase activity and potentiated the maximal enzyme stimulation elicited by corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). The less active enantiomer (+)baclofen had no effect on cyclic AMP formation, whereas the natural agonist GABA mimicked the stimulatory action of (-)baclofen. In radioligand-binding experiments, the affinity and maximal binding capacity of I-125-Tyr-CRH was not affected by (-)baclofen. The GABA(B) receptor antagonist CGP 55845A competitively counteracted the (-)baclofen potentiation of CRH-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity with a pA(2) value of 6.70. Moreover, both (-)baclofen and GABA, but not (+)baclofen, caused a concentration-dependent stimulation of [S-35]GTP gammaS binding to membrane G-proteins. The intracerebral injection of pertussis toxin significantly reduced the facilitatory effects of (-)baclofen on both basal and CRH-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activities. Moreover, membrane incubation with the GDP-bound form of the a subunit of transducin, a scavenger of G protein py subunits, blocked the stimulatory effects of (-)baclofen. The data indicate that in rat frontal cortex activation of GABA(B) receptors potentiates the CRH stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity through a mechanism involving the beta gamma subunits of the pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein G(i)/G(o).

This ternary complex displays high agonist affinity (K-H), resulting in signal transduction. Classical dogma states that, the ratio K-L/K-H predicts intrinsic activity of drugs: the higher the ratio the higher the intrinsic activity. This model was based on studies in which K-L and K-H were indirectly determined by computer analyses of antagonist radioligand binding data. In order to investigate the relationship of K-L, K-H, and intrinsic activity for agonists at 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors, we utilized H-3-agonist and H-3-antagonist radioligands to directly determine K-H and K-L. Comparisons of the log K-L/K-H ratios and intrinsic activities of drugs for stimulating intracellular phosphatidylinositol (PI) hydrolysis revealed a strong correlation for 5-HT2A (r(2) = 0.92) and 5-HT2C (r(2) = 0.96) receptors. The data were fit to computer simulations based on the original ternary complex model and the revised ternary complex model in which an activated state of the receptor (R*) exists in equilibrium with the resting state of the receptor (R). Data produced for both 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors were better-fitted to a revised ternary complex model, rather than the classical ternary complex model. These data support a revised model for the molecular events coupling GPCR to activation of G-proteins and indicate that a strong correlation between the K-L/K-H ratio and intrinsic activity for agonist action at GPCR is consistent with the existence of R*.

Benzodiazepines inhibit adenosine metabolism by blocking nucleoside transporter. Therefore, the authors studied the binding affinities of structurally different benzodiazepines to nucleoside transporter and benzodiazepine-induced potentiation of A(1)-adenosine (negative dromotropy) and A(2A)-adenosine (coronary vasodilation) receptor-mediated effects. Methods: In membranes from porcine striatum and guinea pig ventricle, competition binding assays to displace [H-3]nitrobenzylmercaptopurine riboside ([H-3]NBMPR) from nucleoside transporter were performed using alprazolam, chlorodiazepoxide, diazepam, flurazepam, and midazolam. The augmentation by the most potent benzodiazepine of A(1)- and A(2A)-adenosine receptor-mediated responses, elicited by exogenous administration of adenosine or brief periods of global hypoxia, was subsequently studied in guinea pig Langendorff-perfused hearts. Results: All benzodiazepines completely displaced [H-3]NBMPR in a concentration-dependent manner with Hill coefficients not significantly different from unity in both striatal and ventricular membranes. Midazolam was the most potent inhibitor of nucleoside transporter (ventricle: pK(i) = 5.22 +/- 0.41, K-i = 6 mu M). In isolated hearts, midazolam (5, 10, 20 mu M) significantly augmented coronary flow in a concentration-dependent manner in the presence of adenosine (30 nM), an effect reversed by ZM 241385, a selective A(2A)-receptor antagonist. In contrast, midazolam did nor increase the effect of adenosine (30 nM) on atrioventricular conduction. Similarly, midazolam potentiated A(2A)- but not A(1)-receptor-mediated effects of endogenous adenosine released during hypoxia. Conclusions: Structurally distinct benzodiazepines inhibit nucleoside transporter to different degrees. Midazolam selectively augments A(2A)- but not A(1)-receptor-mediated effects of adenosine by inhibiting nucleoside transporter.

The authors investigated whether and where mitochondrial dysfunction occurs in the living brains of individuals with ASD and to identify the clinical correlates of detected mito-chondrial dysfunction.Methods: This case-control study used positron emission tomography (PET) with 2-tert-butyl-4-chloro-5-{6-[2-(2- [18F]f luoroethoxy)-ethoxy]-pyridin-3-ylmethoxy}-2H-pyridazin-3-one ([18F]BCPP-EF), a radioligand that binds to the mitochondrial electron transport chain complex I, to examine the topographical distribution of mitochondrial dysfunction in living brains of individuals with ASD. Twenty-three adult males with high-functioning ASD, with no psychiatric comorbidities and free of psychotropic medication, and 24 typically developed males with no psychiatric diagnoses, matched with the ASD group on age, parental socioeco-nomic background, and IQ, underwent [18F]BCPP-EF PET measurements. Individuals with mitochondrial disease were excluded by clinical evaluation and blood tests for abnormalities in lactate and pyruvate levels.Results: Among the brain regions in which mitochondrial dysfunction has been reported in postmortem studies of autistic brains, participants with ASD had significantly de-creased [18F]BCPP-EF availability specifically in the anterior cingulate cortex compared with typically developed partic-ipants. The regional specificity was revealed by a significant interaction between diagnosis and brain regions. Moreover, the lower [18F]BCPP-EF availability in the anterior cingulate cortex was significantly correlated with the more severe ASD core symptom of social communication deficits.Conclusions: This study provides direct evidence to link in vivo brain mitochondrial dysfunction with ASD pathophysi-ology and its communicational deficits. The findings support the possibility that mitochondrial electron transport chain complex I is a novel therapeutic target for ASD core symptoms.

In vitro, PF-05212377 was determined to be a P-gp/non-BCRP human transporter substrate. Species differences were observed in the in vivo brain penetration of PF-05212377 with a ratio of the unbound concentration in brain/unbound concentration in plasma (C-bu/C-pu) of 0.05 in rat and 0.64 in non-human primates (NHP). Based on pre-clinical evidence, brain penetration and target engagement of PF-05212377 was confirmed in NHP using positron emission tomography (PET) measured 5-HT6 receptor occupancy (%RO). The NHP C-pu EC50 of PF-05212377 was 0.31 nM (consistent with the in vitro human 5HT6 K-i: 0.32 nM). P-gp has been reported to be expressed in higher abundance at the rat BBB and in similar abundance at the BBB of non-human primates and human; brain penetration of PF-05212377 in humans was postulated to be similar to that in non-human primates. In humans, PF-05212377 demonstrated dose and concentration dependent increases in 5-HT6 RO; maximal 5-HT6 RO of similar to 80% was measured in humans at doses of >= 15 mg with an estimated unbound plasma EC50 of 0.37 nM (which was similar to the in vitro human 5HT6 binding K-i 0.32 nM). In conclusion, cumulative evidence from NHP and human PET RO assessments confirmed that NHP is more appropriate than the rat for the prediction of human brain penetration of PF-05212377, a P-gp/non-BCRP substrate.Clinical trial number: NCT01258751.

To overcome the inconveniences associated with using [18F]FBA in conjugation reactions, we have developed a non -covalent solid-phase synthesis (SPS) strategy for the radiosynthesis of [18F]PARPi, a derivative of olaparib as a Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) radioligand.Methods: Fluoro-, bromo-and iodo-benzoic derivatives of olaparib were synthesized, and their PARP-1 affinities were measured using a recently developed cell culture-based competitive assay. To produce [18F]PARPi, [18F] FBA was radiosynthesized and purified using a cation-exchange cartridge, and then trapped by an anion -exchange resin cartridge, on which the solid-phase radiosynthesis was carried out to produce the desired product. [18F]PARPi was evaluated in vivo in breast and prostate xenograft tumor models by microPET imaging, biodistribution and autoradiography.Results: The best derivatives of olaparib were identified as compound 4, 7 and 8. [18F]4 ([18F]PARPi) was radiosynthesized in high radiochemical yield, high molar activity and high radiochemical purity using this SPS strategy. The in vivo evaluation of [18F]PARPi demonstrates the PARP-1 specific uptake of [18F]PARPi in the animal models.Conclusions: This method is simple and efficient, having great potential for the synthesis of radiopharmaceuticals starting from [18F]FBA or other radiolabeled aromatic acids. Using [18F]PARPi prepared by this method, we demonstrated the promise of [18F]PARPi in the nuclear imaging of PARP-1 expression.

Here, we extended our previous knowledge on the pharmacological profile of 4-amino-6-methyl-2-(3-(4-(4-methylcyclohexa-1,3-dien-1-yl)piperazin-1-yl)propyl)-5-vinylpyridazin-3(2H)-one, here referred as ET1, paving the way for the comprehension of its complete mechanism of action. To this aim, we have evaluated the mouse behavioural responses in several animal models of pain, the effect of ET1 in the murine model of zymosan-induced paw oedema and air-pouch, assessing the cytokines and the cellular phenotype and finally, an in vitro radioligand binding study was performed on a panel of 30 different receptors. In the formalin test, ET1 reduced both neurogenic and inflammatory phase of nociception induced by the aldehyde. Similarly, ET1 strongly reduced paw licking response in the capsaicin test, the abdominal stretching in the writhing test and the carrageenan-induced thermal hyperalgesia. ET1 also evoked a long-lasting reduction of thermal hyperalgesia. Furthermore, ET1 produced a long-lasting anti-inflammatory effect in the zymosan-induced mouse paw oedema and air-pouch through the selective inhibition of inflammatory monocytes recruitment and the modulation of IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha and MCP-1. Binding experiments confirmed an inhibitory effect on adrenergic alpha(1A), alpha(1B) and alpha(2A) receptors subtypes and, for the first time, a moderate affinity was observed for the following receptors: histamine H-1, imidazoline I-2, sigma non-opioid intracellular receptor 1 and sigma(2). These results prompt ET1 as a potent analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent, and support the possibility that it may be suitable for clinical applications in a wide-range of inflammatory-based diseases.

Therefore, developing a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer for imaging of P2X7 receptors in vivo presents a promising approach to diagnose, monitor, and study neuroinflammation in a variety of brain disorders. To fulfill the goal of developing a P2X7 PET ligand as a biomarker of neuroinflammation, [F-18]JNJ-64413739 has been recently disclosed. Procedures We evaluated [F-18]JNJ-64413739 in a rat model of neuroinflammation induced by an intracerebral injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In vivo brain uptake was determined by PET imaging. Upregulation of neuroinflammatory biomarkers was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Distribution of the tracer in the brain was determined by ex vivo autoradiography (ARG). The specificity of [F-18]JNJ-64413739 was confirmed by performing blocking experiments with the P2X7 antagonist JNJ-54175446. Results Brain regions of rats injected with LPS had a significantly increased uptake (34 % +/- 3 % s.e.m., p = 0.036, t test, standardized uptake value measured over the entire scanning period) of [F-18]JNJ-64413739 relative to the corresponding brain regions of control animals injected with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The uptake in the contralateral regions and cerebellum was not significantly different between the groups of animals. The increase in uptake of [F-18]JNJ-64413739 at the LPS-injected site observed by PET imaging was concordant with ex vivo ARG, upregulation of neuroinflammatory biomarkers, and elevated P2X7 expression levels. Conclusions While further work is needed to study [F-18]JNJ-64413739 in other types of neuroinflammation, the current results favorably characterize [F-18]JNJ-64413739 as a potential PET tracer of central neuroinflammation.

Cortical and striatal serotonin transporter binding in a genetic rat model of depression and in response to electroconvulsive stimuli	EUROPEAN NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Flinders sensitive line rats; Flinders resistant line rats; Serotonin transporter; Electroconvulsive therapy; Autoradiography; DASB	FLINDERS-SENSITIVE LINE; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; MAJOR DEPRESSION; ANIMAL-MODEL; ALPHA(2)-ADRENOCEPTOR BINDING; RECEPTOR-BINDING; 5-HT2 RECEPTORS; FSL RAT; BRAIN; SHOCK	Depression is a debilitating mental illness and two thirds of patients respond insufficiently to conventional antidepressants. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) remains the most effective treatment to alleviate drug-refractory depression, however the neurobiological mechanisms are mostly unknown. The serotonergic system plays an important role in depression and alterations in the serotonin transporter (SERT) are seen both in depression and response to antidepressant pharmacotherapies. The first aim of this study was to investigate SERT density in a genetic rat model of depression, Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL), compared to control Flinders Resistant Line (FRL) and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. The second aim was to investigate SERT density in response to electroconvulsive stimuli (ECS), an animal model of ECT. Female rats of each strain were treated with ECS or sham (ear-clip placement with no current) for 10 days before brains were removed, frozen and cut into 20 mu m thick sections. SERT density was measured in striatal and cortical regions by quantitative in vitro autoradiography using the SERT-radioligand, [H-3]-DASB. Higher SERT density was observed in FSL rats compared to SD rats by 36-48% in motor cortex and striatum under sham conditions. In response to ECS, SD rats displayed a significant effect of treatment, whereas no changes were observed in FRL and FSL rats. Increased SERT binding in FSL rats compared to SD supports a dysfunction of the serotonergic system in depression. The increased SERT density after ECS, seen in SD rats but not FSL rats, suggests a different mechanism of action between depressive-like rats and controls. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.

In vivo quantification of glial activation in minipigs overexpressing human α-synuclein	SYNAPSE			English	Article						[C-11](R)PK11195; adeno-associated viral vectors; alpha-synuclein; animal model; inflammation; minipig; Parkinson's disease	VECTOR-MEDIATED OVEREXPRESSION; CEREBRAL METABOLIC-RATE; TUMOR-NECROSIS-FACTOR; PROTEIN 18 KDA; MICROGLIAL ACTIVATION; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; REACTIVE MICROGLIA; BINDING-SITES; PARKINSONS; BRAIN	Parkinson's disease is characterized by a progressive loss of substantia nigra (SN) dopaminergic neurons and the formation of Lewy bodies containing accumulated alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn). The pathology of Parkinson's disease is associated with neuroinflammatory microglial activation, which may contribute to the ongoing neurodegeneration. This study investigates the in vivo microglial and dopaminergic response to overexpression of alpha-syn. We used positron emission tomography (PET) and the 18 kDa translocator protein radioligand, [C-11](R)PK11195, to image brain microglial activation and (+)-alpha-[C-11]dihydrotetrabenazine ([C-11]DTBZ), to measure vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) availability in Gottingen minipigs following injection with recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors expressing either mutant A53T alpha-syn or green fluorescent protein (GFP) into the SN (4 rAAV-alpha-syn, 4 rAAV-GFP, 5 non-injected control minipigs). We performed motor symptom assessment and immunohistochemical examination of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and transgene expression. Expression of GFP and alpha-syn was observed at the SN injection site and in the striatum. We observed no motor symptoms or changes in striatal [C-11]DTBZ binding potential in vivo or striatal or SN TH staining in vitro between the groups. The mean [C-11](R)PK11195 total volume of distribution was significantly higher in the basal ganglia and cortical areas of the alpha-syn group than the control animals. We conclude that mutant alpha-syn expression in the SN resulted in microglial activation in multiple sub- and cortical regions, while it did not affect TH stains or VMAT2 availability. Our data suggest that microglial activation constitutes an early response to accumulation of alpha-syn in the absence of dopamine neuron degeneration.

Development of MS Binding Assays targeting the binding site of MB327 at the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor	TOXICOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	16th Medical Chemical Defense Conference (MCDC)	APR 05-06, 2017	Bundeswehr Med Acad, Munich, GERMANY		Bundeswehr Med Acad	MB327; MS Binding Assays; LC-MS; nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; resensitizer	TORPEDO-CALIFORNICA; NEUROMUSCULAR-TRANSMISSION; CHANNEL; MUSCLE; TRANSPORTER; VALIDATION; MODULATION; INHIBITOR; MEMBRANES; KINETICS	The bispyridinium compound MB327 has been shown previously to have a positive pharmacological effect against poisoning with organophosphorous compounds (OPCs). The mechanism by which it exerts its therapeutic effect seems to be directly mediated by the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). In the present study, the development of mass spectrometry based binding assays (MS Binding Assays) for characterization of the binding site of MB327 at the nAChR from Torpedo californica is described. MS Binding Assays follow the principle of radioligand binding assays, but do not, in contrast to the latter, require a radiolabeled reporter ligand, as the readout is in this case based on mass spectrometric detection. For [H-2(6)] MB327, a deuterated MB327 analogue employed as reporter ligand in the MS Binding Assays, an LC-ESI-MS/MS method was established allowing for its fast and reliable quantification in samples resulting from binding experiments. Using centrifugation for separation of non-bound [H-2(6)] MB327 from target-bound [H-2(6)] MB327 in saturation and autocompetition experiments (employing native MB327 as competitor) enabled reliable determination of specific binding. In this way, the affinities for [H-2(6)] MB327 (K-d = 15.5 +/- 0.9 mu mol L-1) and for MB327 (K-i = 18.3 +/- 2.6 mu mol L-1) towards the nAChR could be determined for the first time. The almost exactly matching affinities for MB327 and [H-2(6)] MB327 obtained in the MS Binding Assays are in agreement with potencies previously found in functional studies. In summary, our results demonstrate that the established MS Binding Assays represent a promising tool for affinity determination of test compounds towards the binding site of MB327 at the nAChR.

Chemerin Elicits Potent Constrictor Actions via Chemokine-Like Receptor 1 (CMIKLR1), not G-Protein-Coupled Receptor 1 (GPR1) in Human and Rat Vasculature	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION			English	Article						agonist; antagonist; blood pressure; chemerin; contraction; G-protein-coupled receptors; human; metabolic syndrome; radioligand binding	CORONARY-ARTERY-DISEASE; SMOOTH-MUSCLE; METABOLIC SYNDROME; ENDOTHELIAL-CELLS; SERINE PROTEASES; IMAGE-ANALYSIS; BETA-ARRESTIN; HYPERTENSION; ACTIVATION; INFLAMMATION	Background-Circulating levels of chemerin are significantly higher in hypertensive patients and positively correlate with blood pressure. Chemerin activates chemokine-like receptor 1 (CMKLR1 or ChemR23) and is proposed to activate the "orphan" G protein-coupled receptor 1 (GPR1), which has been linked with hypertension. Our aim was to localize chemerin. CMKLR1, and GPR1 in the human vasculature and determine whether 1 or both of these receptors mediate vasoconstriction. Methods and Results-Using immunohistochemistry and molecular biology in conduit arteries and veins and resistance vessels, we localized chemerin to endothelium, smooth muscle, and adventitia and found that CMKLR1 and GPR1 were widely expressed in smooth muscle. C9 (chemerin149-157) contracted human saphenous vein (pD(2)=7.30 +/- 0.31) and resistance arteries (pD(2)=7.05 +/- 0.54) and increased blood pressure in rats by 9.1 +/- 1.0 mm Hg at 200 nmol. Crucially, these in vitro and in vivo vascular actions were blocked by CCX832, which we confirmed to be highly selective for CMKLR1 over GPR1. C9 inhibited cAMP accumulation in human aortic smooth muscle cells and preconstricted rat aorta, consistent with the observed vasoconstrictor action. Downstream signaling was explored further and, compared to chemerin. C9 showed a bias factor=approximate to 5000 for the Gi protein pathway, suggesting that CMKLR1 exhibits biased agonism. Conclusions-Our data suggest that chemerin acts at CMKLR1, but not GPR1, to increase blood pressure. Chemerin has an established detrimental role in metabolic syndrome, and these direct vascular actions may contribute to hypertension, an additional risk factor for cardiovascular disease. This study provides proof of principle for the therapeutic potential of selective CMKLR1 antagonists.

We investigated the functional consequences of genetic beta(1)-AR knockdown in three-dimensional engineered heart tissue (EHT). For beta(1)-AR knockdown, short interfering RNA (siRNA) sequences targeting specifically the beta(1)-AR (shB1) and a scrambled control (shCTR) were subcloned into a recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV)-short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression system. Transduction efficiency was similar to 100%, and radioligand binding revealed 70% lower beta(1)-AR density in AAV6-shB1-transduced EHTs. Force measurements, performed over the culture period of 14 days, showed paradoxically higher force generation in AAV6-shB1 compared with shCTR under basal (0.19 +/- 0.01 versus 0.13 +/- 0.01 mN) and after beta-AR-stimulated conditions with isoprenaline (Delta fractional shortening: 72 +/- 5% versus 34 +/- 4%). Large scale gene expression analysis revealed that AAV6-shCTR compared with nontransduced EHTs showed only few differentially regulated genes (< 20), whereas AAV6-shB1 induced marked changes in gene expression (> 250 genes), indicating that beta(1)-AR knockdown itself determines the outcome. None of the regulated genes pointed to obvious offtarget effects to explain higher force generation. Moreover, compensational regulation of beta(2)-AR signaling or changes in prominent beta(1)-AR downstream targets could be ruled out. In summary, we show paradoxically higher force generation and isoprenaline responses after efficient beta(1)-AR knockdown in EHTs. Our findings 1) reveal an unexpected layer of complexity in gene regulation after specific beta(1)-AR knockdown rather than unspecific dysregulations through transcriptional interference, 2) challenge classic assumptions on the role of cardiac beta(1)-AR, and 3) may open up new avenues for b-AR loss-of-function research in vivo.

J	Lattin, CR; Romero, LM				Lattin, Christine R.; Romero, L. Michael			Chronic exposure to a low dose of ingested petroleum disrupts corticosterone receptor signalling in a tissue-specific manner in the house sparrow (<i>Passer domesticus</i>)	CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						bird; endocrine disruption; glucocorticoid receptor; hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis; mineralocorticoid receptor; toxicology		Stress-induced concentrations of glucocorticoid hormones (including corticosterone, CORT) can be suppressed by chronic exposure to a low dose of ingested petroleum. However, endocrine-disrupting chemicals could interfere with CORT signalling beyond the disruption of hormone titres, including effects on receptors in different target tissues. In this study, we examined the effects of 6 weeks of exposure to a petroleum-laced diet (1% oil weight: food weight) on tissue mass and intracellular CORT receptors in liver, fat, muscle and kidney (metabolic tissues), spleen (an immune tissue) and testes (a reproductive tissue). In the laboratory, male house sparrows were fed either a 1% weathered crude oil (n = 12) or a control diet (n = 12); glucocorticoid receptors and mineralocorticoid receptors were quantified using radioligand binding assays. In oil-exposed birds, glucocorticoid receptors were lower in one metabolic tissue (liver), higher in another metabolic tissue (fat) and unchanged in four other tissues (kidney, muscle, spleen and testes) compared with control birds. We saw no differences in mineralocorticoid receptors between groups. We also saw a trend towards reduced mass of the testes in oil-exposed birds compared with controls, but no differences in fat, kidney, liver, muscle or spleen mass between the two groups. This is the first study to examine the effects of petroleum on CORT receptor density in more than one or two target tissues. Given that a chronic low dose of ingested petroleum can affect stress-induced CORT titres as well as receptor density, this demonstrates that oil can act at multiple levels to disrupt an animal's response to environmental stressors. This also highlights the potential usefulness of the stress response as a bioindicator of chronic crude oil exposure.	[Lattin, Christine R.; Romero, L.

This study used positron emission tomography with the radioligand [C-11]MDL 100907 to examine whether the distribution of serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptors is altered in OCD. Methods: Nineteen OCD subjects, free of psychiatric medications and depression, and 19 matched healthy subjects underwent positron emission tomography scans following injection of [C-11]MDL 100907. Total distribution volumes were derived by kinetic analysis using the arterial input function. Two measures of 5-HT2A availability were computed: the ratio at equilibrium of specifically bound radiotracer either to nondisplaceable radiotracer in tissue (BPND) or to unmetabolized tracer in arterial plasma (BPp). Groups were compared using a region of interest (ROI) analysis and voxelwise analysis of spatially normalized parametric maps. ROIs included cortical (orbitofrontal, dorsolateral prefrontal, medial prefrontal, anterior cingulate, temporal, parietal, occipital, and insular cortex) and limbic (entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, and medial temporal lobe) regions. Results: No significant group differences were observed in [C-11] MDL 100907 BPND or BPp in the ROIs or in the voxelwise analysis of BPND maps. There was a significant correlation in the orbitofrontal cortex between [C-11]MDL 100907 binding and age of onset, with earlier age of onset associated with higher binding. Conclusions: Adults with OCD are not characterized as a group by major changes in 5-HT2A availability in cortical or limbic brain regions. Further research is warranted to examine potential differences in 5-HT2A availability between early-and late-onset OCD and to assess 5-HT2A function in relation to other neurotransmitter systems implicated in OCD.

Epilepsy affects half of patients. The murine model is associated with a transition from absence to convulsive seizures in the third week, with fatal status epilepticus. Methods: The clinical phenotype is reported from a patient database. Flumazenil-Positron Emission Topography (FMZ-PET) and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) were used to study GABA neurotransmission. Electrocorticography, single cell electrophysiology, and radioligand binding studies are reported from animal studies. Results: Generalized seizures predominate, including tonic clonic, atypical absence, and myoclonic. EEG discharges are typically generalized spike-wave. MRI shows a dentatopallidoluysian pattern. Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy Patients (SUDEP) has occurred and the associated neuropathology reveals chronic excitotoxic injury in gloubus pallidus. Investigations using FMZ-PET and TMS support downregulation of GABA(A) and GABA(B) activity, respectively, in patients. Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) induces spike-wave discharges in homozygous null mice via GHB and GABA(B)-mediated mechanisms. These resemble absence seizures and are abolished by a GABA(B) receptor antagonist. Decreased binding of GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptor antagonists has been demonstrated in P19 and P14 null mice, respectively. Downregulation of GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptor subunits is observed by P14. GABA(A) and GABA(B) mediated potentials are reduced from P8-P14. Conclusion: Generalized epilepsy and epileptiform discharges are characteristic of SSADH deficiency. Spontaneous absence seizures appear in null mice by the third week, which may be induced by GHB or GABA(B) activity. Subsequent overuse dependent downregulation of GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptor activity may be associated with hyperexcitability concomitant with the transition to generalized seizures.

Modulation of α<sub>2C</sub> adrenergic receptor temperature-sensitive trafficking by HSP90	BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-MOLECULAR CELL RESEARCH			English	Article						alpha(2C)-AR; HSP90; Heat shock proteins; Intracellular traffic; Molecular chaperones; Low temperature; Raynaud Phenomenon	HEAT-SHOCK-PROTEIN; COLD-INDUCED CONSTRICTION; CELL-SURFACE EXPRESSION; 3RD INTRACELLULAR LOOP; PLASMA-MEMBRANE; ANGIOTENSIN-II; CHAPERONE; EXPORT; SUBTYPES; ALPHA(2C)-ADRENOCEPTORS	Decreasing the temperature to 30 C is accompanied by significant enhancement of alpha(2C)-AR plasma membrane levels in several cell lines with fibroblast phenotype, as demonstrated by radioligand binding in intact cells. No changes were observed on the effects of low-temperature after blocking receptor internalization in alpha(2C)-AR transfected HEK293T cells. In contrast, two pharmacological chaperones, dimethyl sulfoxide and glycerol, increased the cell surface receptor levels at 37 degrees C, but not at 30 degrees C. Further, at 37 degrees C alpha(2C)-AR is co-localized with endoplasmic reticulum markers, but not with the lysosomal markers. Treatment with three distinct HSP90 inhibitors, radicicol, macbecin and 17-DMAG significantly enhanced alpha(2C)-AR cell surface levels at 37 degrees C, but these inhibitors had no effect at 30 degrees C. Similar results were obtained after decreasing the HSP90 cellular levels using specific siRNA. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that alpha(2C)-AR interacts with HSP90 and this interaction is decreased at 30 degrees C. The contractile response to endogenous alpha(2C)-AR stimulation in rat tail artery was also enhanced at reduced temperature. Similar to HEK293T cells, HSP90 inhibition increased the alpha(2C)-AR contractile effects only at 37 degrees C. Moreover, exposure to low-temperature of vascular smooth muscle cells from rat tail artery decreased the cellular levels of HSP90, but did not change HSP70 levels. These data demonstrate that exposure to low-temperature augments the alpha(2C)-AR transport to the plasma membrane by releasing the inhibitory activity of HSP90 on the receptor traffic, findings which may have clinical relevance for the diagnostic and treatment of Raynaud Phenomenon.

Expression and functional role of adenosine receptors in regulating inflammatory responses in human synoviocytes	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						adenosine receptors; human synoviocytes; mRNA; Western blotting; receptor binding; cAMP; MAPK p38; NF-kappa B; TNF-alpha; IL-8	TUMOR-NECROSIS-FACTOR; FACTOR-KAPPA-B; FIBROBLAST-LIKE SYNOVIOCYTES; FACTOR-ALPHA RELEASE; TNF-ALPHA; BIOCHEMICAL-CHARACTERIZATION; ANTAGONIST RADIOLIGAND; INDUCED ARTHRITIS; A(2A); ACTIVATION	Background and purpose: Adenosine is an endogenous modulator, interacting with four G-protein coupled receptors (A(1), A(2A), A(2B) and A(3)) and acts as a potent inhibitor of inflammatory processes in several tissues. So far, the functional effects modulated by adenosine receptors on human synoviocytes have not been investigated in detail. We evaluated mRNA, the protein levels, the functional role of adenosine receptors and their pharmacological modulation in human synoviocytes. Experimental approach: mRNA, Western blotting, saturation and competition binding experiments, cyclic AMP, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B activation, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) release were assessed in human synoviocytes isolated from patients with osteoarthritis. Key results: mRNA and protein for A(1), A(2A), A(2B) and A(3) adenosine receptors are expressed in human synoviocytes. Standard adenosine agonists and antagonists showed affinity values in the nanomolar range and were coupled to stimulation or inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Activation of A(2A) and A(3) adenosine receptors inhibited p38 MAPK and NF-kappa B pathways, an effect abolished by selective adenosine antagonists. A(2A) and A(3) receptor agonists decreased TNF-alpha and IL-8 production. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase or G(s) pathways were involved in the functional responses of A(3) or A(2A) adenosine receptors. Synoviocyte A(1) and A(2B) adenosine receptors were not implicated in the inflammatory process whereas stimulation of A(2A) and A(3) adenosine receptors was closely associated with a down-regulation of the inflammatory status. Conclusions and implications: These results indicate that A(2A) and A(3) adenosine receptors may represent a potential target in therapeutic modulation of joint inflammation.	[Borea, P.

The high affinity state is thought to represent the functional state of the receptor and proportions might alter during disease. In vitro studies further indicate that agonists induce measurable D-2 receptor occupancy at clinically relevant concentrations but only when measured at the high affinity state. Recently developed PET-radioligands, such as [C-11]MNPA, have now made it possible to directly study agonist binding in vivo. The aim of this study was to compare the inhibition by apomorphine of agonist and antagonist radioligand binding to D-2/3 receptors in vivo. A total of 36 PET measurements were performed with the D-2/3 antagonist [C-11]raclopride or the D-2/3 agonist [C-11]MNPA in two cynomolgus monkeys. On each study day, a baseline measurement was followed by two consecutive pretreatment studies with rising doses of apomorphine (0.01, 0.05, 0.15, 0.5, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg). Binding potential (BPND) values were calculated for the striatum with cerebellum as reference region. Apomorphine inhibited [C-11]raclopride and [C-11]MNPA binding in a dose-dependent manner and to a similar extent. ID50 and K-i values were 0.26 mg/kg and 29 ng/ml for [C-11]raclopride and 0.50 mg/kg and 31 ng/ml for [C-11]MNPA. The present observations do not support the existence of two affinity states in vivo. It might thus be speculated that all D-2/3 receptors are in the high affinity state at in vivo conditions. Synapse 63:378-389, 2009. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Each subject participated in two 93-minute PET-measurements with [C-11]flumazenil and [F-18]flumazenil, respectively. Data were analyzed using compartment models with metabolite-corrected arterial plasma input and reference tissue models using the pons as reference region. There was no evident difference between the kinetic behaviors of the two ligands. Overall, the noise in the time activity curves for [F-18]flumazenil was lower at late time points, and the variance of the kinetic parameters was lower than for [C-11]flumazenil. In BZ receptor rich regions, such as the neocortex, the 3-compartment model was statistically favored, whereas the 2-compartment model was favored in the pons. Binding potential values obtained by the reference tissue models were in good agreement with those obtained by the kinetic analysis. There was no support for the presence of specific binding in the pons. In conclusion, the binding and the kinetic behavior of [C-11]flumazenil and [F-18] flumazenil were similar. The present analysis supports the use of pons as reference region in simplified protocols without arterial blood sampling. [F-18]flumazenil should thus be an excellent choice for applied studies at centers not having a cyclotron. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We characterized the effect of zinc (Zn2+) on the binding properties of the 5-HT1A receptor. The allosteric ternary complex model was applied to determine the dissociation constant (K-A) of Zn2+ and their cooperativity factors (alpha) affecting the dissociation constants (K-D, K-i) of [H-3]WAY-100635, [H-3]8-OH-DPAT, and serotonin (5-HT), the endogenous neurotransmitter. Zn2+ (5 mu M-1 mM) inhibited the binding of agonist/antagonist to 5-HT1A receptors, mostly by decreasing both the ligands' affinity and the maximal number of sites. In [S-35]GTP gamma S binding assays Zn2+ behaved as insourmountable antagonist of 5-HT1A receptors, in agreement with radioligand binding assays. The residues involved in the formation of the inhibitory binding site on the 5-HT1A receptor were assessed by using N-ethyl-maleimide (NEM) or diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) which modify preferentially cysteine and histidine residues, respectively. Exposure to both agents did not block the negative allosteric effects of Zn2+ on agonist and antagonist binding. Our findings represent the first quantitative analysis of allosteric binding interactions for 5-HT1A receptors. The physiological significance of Zn2+ modulation of 5-HT1A receptors is unclear, but the colocalization of 5-HT1A receptors and Zn2+ in the nervous system (e.g. in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex) suggests that Zn2+ released at nerve terminals may modulate signals generated by the 5-HT1A receptors in vivo. Finally, these findings suggest that synaptic Zn2+ may be a factor influencing the effectiveness of therapies that rely on 5-HT1A receptor activity (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Development of the predictor hERG fluorescence polarization assay using a membrane protein enrichment approach	ASSAY AND DRUG DEVELOPMENT TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article							LONG-QT-SYNDROME; CARDIAC-ARRHYTHMIA; POTASSIUM CHANNEL; K+ CHANNELS; SAFETY PHARMACOLOGY; BINDING ASSAY; PATCH-CLAMP; CELLS; VALIDATION; AFFINITY	The life-threatening consequences of acquired, or drug-induced, long QT syndrome due to block of the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) channel are well appreciated and have been the cause of several drugs being removed from the market in recent years because of patient death. In the last decade, the propensity for block of the hERG channel by a diverse and expanding set of compounds has led to the requirement that all new drugs be tested for hERG channel block in a functional patch-clamp assay. Because of the need to identify potential hERG blockers early in the discovery process, radiometric hERG binding assays are preferred over patch-clamp assays for compound triage, because of relative advantages in speed and cost. Even so, these radiometric binding assays are laborious and require dedicated instrumentation and infrastructure to cope with the regulatory and safety issues associated with the use of radiation. To overcome these limitations, we developed a homogeneous, fluorescence polarization-based assay to identify and characterize the affinity of small molecules for the hERG channel and have demonstrated tight correlation with data obtained from either radioligand binding or patch-clamp assays. Key to the development of this assay was a cell line that expressed highly elevated levels of hERG protein, which was generated by coupling expression of the hERG channel to that of a selectable cell surface marker. A high-expressing clone was isolated by flow cytometry and used to generate membrane preparations that contained >50-fold the typical density of hERG channels measured by [H-3] astemizole binding. This strategy enabled the Predictor (TM) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) hERG fluorescence polarization assay and should be useful in the development of other fluorescence polarization-based assays that use membrane proteins.

It is composed of five subunits, of which the 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunits are best characterized. Several studies, however, have reported on the functional diversity of native 5-HT3 receptors, which cannot solely be explained on the basis of the 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunits. After our discovery of further putative 5-HT3 serotonin receptor-encoding genes, HTR3C, HTR3D, and HTR3E, we investigated whether these novel candidates and the isoform 5-HT3Ea are able to form functional 5-HT3 receptor complexes. Using immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation studies of heterologously expressed proteins, we found that each of the respective candidates coassembles with 5-HT3A. To investigate whether the novel subunits modulate 5-HT3 receptor function, we performed radioligand-binding assays and calcium-influx studies in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Our experiments revealed that the 5-HT3C, 5-HT3D, 5-HT3E, and 5-HT3Ea subunits alone cannot form functional receptors. Coexpression with 5-HT3A, however, results in the formation of functional heteromeric complexes with different serotonin efficacies. Potencies of two agonists and antagonists were nearly identical with respect to homomeric 5-HT3A and heteromeric complexes. However, 5-HT showed increased efficacy with respect to 5-HT3A/D and 5-HT3A/E receptors, which is consistent with the increased surface expression compared with 5-HT3 Areceptors. In contrast, 5-HT3A/C and 5-HT3A/Ea receptors exhibited decreased 5-HT efficacy. These data show for the first time that the novel 5-HT3 subunits are able to form heteromeric 5-HT3 receptors, which exhibit quantitatively different functional properties compared with homomeric 5-HT3A receptors.

The aim of this study was to investigate the in vivo binding characteristics of [C-11]R121920 and [C-11]DMP696 in the nonhuman primate for application in positron emission tomography (PET) studies of CRF1. Methods: PET imaging with the two novel CRF1 radioligands was performed in baboon. In vitro binding studies for CRF1 were performed in postmortem brain tissue of baboon and human to assess sufficiency of receptor density for PET. Results: Both [C-11]R121920 and [C-11]DMP696 distributed rapidly and uniformly throughout the brain. Washout was comparable across brain regions, without differences in volume of distribution between regions reported to have high and low in vitro CRF1 binding. Membrane-enriched tissue homogenate assay using [I-125]Tyro-sauvagine and specific CRF1 antagonists CP154,526 and SN003 in human occipital cortex yielded maximal binding (B-max) of 63.3 and 147.3 fmol/mg protein, respectively, and in human cerebellar cortex yielded B-max of 103.6 and 64.6 fmol/mg protein, respectively. Dissociation constants (K-D) were subnanomolar. In baboon, specific binding was not detectable in the same regions; therefore, B-max and K-D were not measurable. Autoradiographic results were consistent except there was also detectable CRF1-specific binding in baboon cerebellum. Conclusion: Neither [C-11]R121920 nor [C-11]DMP696 demonstrated quantifiable regional binding in vivo in baboon. In vitro results suggest CRF1 density in baboon may be insufficient for PET. Studies in man may generate more promising results due to the higher CRF1 density compared with baboon in cerebral cortex and cerebellum. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Within this series, 2-[6-chloro-2-(4-iodophenyl)-imidazo[1,2-alpyridin-3-yl]-N-ethyl-N-methyl-acetamide (CLINME) was considered as an appropriate candidate for positron emission tomography imaging and was isotopically labelled with carbon-11 (T-1/2: 20.38 min) at the methylacetamide side chain from the corresponding nor-analogue using [C-11]methyl iodide and the following experimental conditions: (1) trapping at -10 degrees C of [C-11]methyl iodide in a 1/2 (v:v) mixture of DMSO/DMF (300 mu l) containing 0.7-1.0 mg of the precursor for labelling and 3-5 mg of powdered potassium hydroxide (excess); (2) heating the reaction mixture at 110 degrees C for 3 min under a nitrogen stream; (3) diluting the residue with 0.6 ml of the HPLC mobile phase; and (4) purification using semi-preparative HPLC (Zorbax(R) SB18, Hewlett Packard, 250 x 9.4 mm). Typically, starting from a 1.5Ci (55.5 GBq) [C-11]CO2 production batch, 120-150 mCi (4.44-5.55 GBq) of [C-11]CLINME were obtained (16-23% decay-corrected radiochemical yield, n = 12) within a total synthesis time of 24-27 min (Sep-pak(R)Plus-based formulation included). Specific radio-activities ranged from 0.9 to 2.7 Ci/mu mol (33.3-99.9 GBq/mu mol) at the end of radiosynthesis. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

A potent 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(2A) receptor inverse agonist ACP-103 competitively antagonized the binding of [H-3] ketanserin to heterologously expressed human 5-HT2A receptors with a mean pK(i) of 9.3 in membranes and 9.70 in whole cells. ACP-103 displayed potent inverse agonist activity in the cell-based functional assay receptor selection and amplification technology (R-SAT), with a mean pIC(50) of 8.7. ACP-103 demonstrated lesser affinity (mean pK(i) of 8.80 in membranes and 8.00 in whole cells, as determined by radioligand binding) and potency as an inverse agonist (mean pIC(50) 7.1 in R-SAT) at human 5-HT2C receptors, and lacked affinity and functional activity at 5-HT2B receptors, dopamine D-2 receptors, and other human monoaminergic receptors. Behaviorally, ACP-103 attenuated head-twitch behavior (3 mg/kg p.o.), and prepulse inhibition deficits (1-10 mg/kg s.c.) induced by the 5-HT2A receptor agonist (+/-)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine hydrochloride in rats and reduced the hyperactivity induced in mice by the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor noncompetitive antagonist 5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine (dizocilpine maleate; MK801) (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg s.c.; 3 mg/kg p.o.), consistent with a 5-HT2A receptor mechanism of action in vivo and antipsychoticlike efficacy. ACP-103 demonstrated > 42.6% oral bioavailability in rats. Thus, ACP-103 is a potent, efficacious, orally active 5-HT2A receptor inverse agonist with a behavioral pharmacological profile consistent with utility as an antipsychotic agent.

This study is intended to assess the validity of the method using the cerebellum as a reference region, and to evaluate the effects of anesthesia on C-11 -NMPB binding. Two monkeys, anesthetized with ketamine, received intravenous C-11-NMPB alone (370-760 MBq, < 1 mu g/kg) or mixed with varying doses of nonradioactive NMPB (3 mu g/kg, 10,mu glkg, 30 mu g/kg) and were subjected to PET scans for 60 minutes. Regions of interest (ROI) were drawn on reconstructed PET images and a time-activity curve was obtained for each region. C-11-NMPB accumulated densely in the striatum and cerebral cortex with time. In contrast, the tracer accumulation significantly decreased with increased doses of nonradioactive NMPB. In the cerebellum, on the other hand, the accumulation of C-11-NMPB remained low and the tracer was slowly eliminated from the brain following the injection. C-11-NMPB binding in the cerebellum was barely affected by the increased dose of nonradioactive NMPB. We thus concluded that the specific C-11-NMPB binding was negligible in the cerebellum, and performed simplified evaluation of C-11-NMPB binding in each brain region by a graphical method using the cerebellum as a reference region. PET was conducted 26 times, in total both in ketamine-anesthetized and awake monkeys (n = 3 each). Measurements of C-11-NMPB binding showed good run-to-run reproducibility within individual animals. When C-11-NMPB binding was compared between ketamine-treated and awake animals, a significant increase in "C-NMPB binding was observed in the striatum but not in other brain regions of ketamine-treated animals.

Activation of these receptors with non-selective cannabinoid receptor agonists reduces pain sensitivity in animals and humans. However, activation of CB1 receptors is also associated with central side effects, including ataxia and catalepsy. More recently, a role for selective CB2 agonists in pain modification has been demonstrated. GW405833, a selective CB2 agonist, was recently reported to partially reverse the inflammation and hyperalgesia in a rat model of acute inflammation. In the current report, we extend the characterization and therapeutic potential of this compound. For the first time, we show that GW405833 selectively binds both rat and human CB2 receptors with high affinity, where it acts as a partial agonist (similar to 50% reduction of forskolin-mediated cAMP production compared to the full cannabinoid agonist, CP55,940). We also report for the first time that intraperitoneal administration of GW405833 (0.3100 mg/kg) to rats shows linear, dose-dependent increases in plasma levels and substantial penetration into the central nervous system. In addition, GW405833 (up to 30 mg/kg) elicits potent and efficacious antihyperalgesic effects in rodent models of neuropathic, incisional and chronic inflammatory pain, the first description of this compound in these models. In contrast, analgesia, sedation and catalepsy were not observed in this dose range, but were apparent at 100 mg/kg. Additionally, GW405833 was not antihyperalgesic against chronic inflammatory pain in CB2 knockout mice. These data support the tenet that selective CB2 receptor agonists have the potential to treat pain without eliciting the centrally-mediated side effects associated with non-selective cannabinoid agonists, and highlight the utility of GW405833 for the investigation of CB2 physiology.

The retina also produces melatonin, although in the case of the European sea bass, its secretion pattern appears to be inverted. In the study described here, radioreceptor assay techniques were used to characterize the melatonin binding sites, their regional distribution and their daily variations. Brain and retina membrane preparations were used in all the binding assays and 2[I-125]iodomelatonin ([I-125]Mel) as radioligand at 25 C. The specific binding of [1251]Mel was seen to be saturable, reversible, specific and of high affinity. In all the tissues assayed, the power of the ligands to inhibit [I-125]Mel binding decreased in the following order: melatonin much greater than4P-PDO>luzindolegreater than or equal toN-acetylserotonin, which points to the presence of Mel 1-like receptors. The inhibition curves of 4-P-PDOT suggested the presence of two different binding sites in the brain areas, but only one type of site of low affinity in the neural retina. No daily variations in [I-125]Mel binding capacity (B-max) or affinity (K-d) were detected in the brain areas, while a clear rhythm in K-d melatonin receptor affinity and B-max binding capacity was observed in the retina. K-d and B-max retinal rhythms were out of phase with the lowest K-d and the highest B-max occurring at scotophase. This result suggests that retinal melatonin is a paracrine factor able to control receptor desensitization during photophase when ocular melatonin is higher in this species. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Methods Sera of 750 patients with an initial diagnosis of T2DM from central south of China were screened for GADA using a radioligand assay. The distribution and frequency of GADA levels were described. Two hundred and ninety-five patients were divided into the T2DM group (n=233) and the LADA group (n = 62) to compare the age of onset, body mass index, HbA(1)c, C-peptide, hypertension, dyslipidemia and chronic diabetic complications. Furthermore, LADA patients with different GADA titers were subdivided to analyze the same indexes as the above. Results The prevalence of LADA (defined as GADAgreater than or equal to0.05, namely GADA positive) was 9.7% in the 750 initially diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients. Compared with T2DM, LADA patients were younger at their ages of onset, had lower C-peptide and body mass index, and also had less cases with hypertension and with dyslipidemia. However, only patients with high titer of GADA had poorer beta cell functions and less diabetic complications compared to T2DM and low GADA titer of LADA patients. Patients with low GADA titer were similar to T2DM patients, except that they were prone to develop ketosis more frequently. Conclusions Two clinically distinct subtypes of LADA can be identified by GADA levels in patients initially-diagnosed as type 2 diabetes. Patients with high titer of GADA (GADA greater than or equal to 0.5) subsequently develope more insulin dependency, which are classified as LADA-type 1; while those with lower GADA titer (0.05 less than or equal to GADA < 0.5) and having clinical and metabolic phenotypes of type 2 diabetes are classified as LADA-type 2.

In rat pituitary cells and mouse alphaT3-1 precursor gonadotrophs, the human alphaGSU promoter is strongly responsive to activators of the adenylyl cyclase/cAMP pathway, such as the hypothalamic releasing hormone, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) and forskolin (an adenylyl cyclase activator). However, the role of PACAP and cAMP in regulating aGSU transcription in the more differentiated LbetaT2 gonaclotroph is unclear. Here, we investigate the regulation of the human alphaGSU promoter by PACAP and forskolin in LbetaT2 and alphaT3-1 gonadotrophs. PACAP failed to stimulate alphaGSU promoter activity or cAMP production in LbetaT2 cells, in marked contrast to alphaT3-1 cells. LbetaT2 gonadotrophs expressed extremely low levels of any PACAP type 1 receptors (PAC(1)-R) isoform by RT-PCR and lacked PAC(1)-R by radioligand binding. Forskolin stimulated the aGSU promoter in LbetaT2 cells, but by less than 30% of the response seen in aT3-1 gonadotrophs. This blunted cAMP transcriptional effect was not due to different levels of cAMP generation, or altered expression of the cAMP target proteins CREB, Akt, CBP or ICER. However, only LbetaT2 cells showed detectable expression of the protein kinase A type IIalpha regulatory subunit. Binding of activating transcription factor-2 and phosphorylated CREB to the consensus CRE was observed in both LbetaT2 and alphaT3-1 gonadotrophs, yet forskolin failed to stimulate either CRE- or CREB-mediated transcription in LbetaT2 cells. Collectively, these data demonstrate the lack of functional PACAP receptors in LbetaT2 gonadotrophs, and a pronounced attenuation in the responsiveness of this differentiated gonaclotroph cell line to cAMP stimulus.

Methods: Whole-body scans were performed in 3 healthy male volunteers up to 2 h after intravenous injection of 137-238 MBq F-18-fluoro-A-85380. Transmission scans (3 min per step, 8 or 9 steps according to the height of the subject) in 2-dimensional mode were used for subsequent correction of attenuation of emission scans. Emission scans (1 min per step) were acquired over 2 h. Venous blood samples were taken up to 2 h after injection of the radiotracer. Urine was freely collected up to 2 h after injection of the radiotracer. For each subject, the percentage of injected activity measured in regions of interest over brain, intestine, stomach, bladder, kidneys, and liver were fitted to a monoexponential model, as an uptake phase followed by a monoexponential washout, or to a biexponential model to generate time-activity curves. Using the MIRD method, ten source organs were considered in estimating radiation absorbed doses for organs of the body. Results: Injection of F-18-fluoro-A-85380 was clinically well tolerated and blood and urine pharmacologic parameters did not change significantly. The primary routes of clearance were renal and intestinal. Ten minutes after injection, high activities were observed in the bladder, kidneys, and liver. Slow uptake was seen in the brain. The liver received the highest absorbed dose. The average effective dose of F-18-fluoro-A-85380 was estimated to be 0.0194 mSv/MBq. Conclusion: The amount of F-18-fluoro-A-85380 required for adequate nAChR imaging results in an acceptable effective dose equivalent to the patient.

Methods: DNA and nucleosome antibodies were detected by ELISA, antibodies to SmB, U1A-RNP, Ro52, Ro60 and La by a new radioligand assay, using de novo synthesized radio-labeled antigens. Results: Analysis of anti-chromatin (including anti-nucleosome, anti-dsDNA and anti-histone antibodies) and of anti-snRNP antibodies (including anti-U1A-RNP, anti-SmB, anti-Ro52, anti-Ro60, anti-La antibodies) was performed in sequential sera from B/W, MRL+/+, MRL Yaa and MRL lpr/lpr mice. In a cohort of 105 MRL+/+ mice of different ages, 59, 51, and 57 mice were positive for anti-nucleosome, anti-SmB and anti-U1A-RNP, respectively. None of them was positive for anti-dsDNA. Importantly, antibody positivities were not randomly distributed but were significantly clustered in individual mice. Appearance of DNA- and RNA-protein complex antibodies started at similar to18-20 weeks of age, preceding that of the anti-dsDNA (or anti-histone) antibodies that only started at 30-32 weeks. Anti-nucleosome, anti-SmB and anti-U1A-RNP antibody responses did not display any cross-reactivity as demonstrated by inhibition and adsorption experiments. Conclusion: These data indicate that anti-nucleosome and anti-snRNP antibodies appear early and concomitantly in lupus prone mice even though they do not share any cross-reactivity. These results fit with the assumption that their production is triggered by tightly physically associated nucleosomes and snRNP autoantigens contained in the same apoptotic bodies.

We show here that dopamine interacts directly with dopaminergic receptors on normal human T cells and triggers beta1 integrin-mediated T cell adhesion to a major extracellular matrix component, fibronectin (FN). Such adhesion is a characteristic feature of activated T cells, and is critical for trafficking and extravasation of T cells across blood vessels and tissue barriers. Seven dopamine D2/D3 receptor agonists and antagonists were used to identify the receptor subtypes with which dopamine specifically interacts to activate T cells. The D3 dopamine receptor agonist, 7-hydroxy-DPAT (DPAT), mimics the effects of dopamine, and the effects of both dopamine and DPAT are blocked by a specific D3 receptor antagonist, U-maleate. The dopamine receptor agonists bromocriptine and pergolide mimic the direct effect of dopamine on the beta1 integrin function, while the dopamine receptor antagonists butaclamol and haloperidol suppress it, suggesting additional signaling via the dopamine D2 receptor subtype. Our study shows, for the first time, that dopamine can directly activate T cells via its specific receptors and suggests a possible role for dopamine in integrin-mediated cellular trafficking and extravasation of T cells in the central nervous system and possibly also in the periphery. Finally, we suggest that the reported changes in the D3 and D2 receptor RNA levels in peripheral blood lymphocytes of individuals with schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and migraine can serve not only as a 'passive' diagnostic marker, but primarily reflect the dynamic functional dopamine-T cell interactions in these diseases.

We investigated to which extent these differences are determined by alpha 1D itself by analyzing the biophysical and pharmacological properties of cloned human alpha 1D splice variants in tsA-201 cells. Variant alpha 1Ds(8A) containing exon 8A sequence in repeat I, yielded alpha 1D protein and L-type currents, whereas no intact protein and currents were observed after expression with exon 8B. In whole cell patch-clamp recordings (charge carrier 15-20 mM Ba2+), alpha 1D(8A) - mediated currents activated at more negative voltages (activation threshold, -45.7 versus -31.5 mV, p < 0.05) and more rapidly (tau (act) for maximal inward currents 0.8 versus 2.3 ms; p < 0.05) than currents mediated by rabbit cylC, Inactivation during depolarizing pulses was slower than for alpha 1C (current inactivation after 5-s depolarizations by 90 versus 99%, p < 0.05) but faster than for LTCCs in IHCs. The sensitivity for the dihydropyridine (DHP) L type channel blocker isradipine was 8.5-fold lower than for alpha 1C. Radioligand binding experiments revealed that this was not due to a lower affinity for the DHP binding pocket, suggesting that differences in the voltage dependence of DHP block account for decreased sensitivity of D-LTCCs, Our experiments show that alpha 1D(8A) subunits can form slowly inactivating LTCCs activating at more negative voltages than alpha 1C, These properties should allow D-LTCCs to control physiological processes, such as diastolic depolarization in sinoatrial node cells, neurotransmitter release in IHCs and neuronal excitability.

The purpose of this study was to examine the autoradiographic distribution of these three receptor types in the human bladder, to determine whether the anatomic location of the receptors was consistent with their known functional roles. Materials and Methods: Specimens of urinary bladder from 9 patients (58-74 years) were obtained at cystectomy. Frozen sections of dome were labeled with [I-125] -Bolton-Hunter [Sar(9),Met(O-2)(11)]-SP (NK-1 receptors), [I-125]-[Lys(5),Tyr(I-2)(7),MeLeu(9),Nle(10)]-NKA(4-10) (NK-2 receptors) and [I-125]-rat CGRP-I. Binding sites were visualized using emulsion autoradiography. Results: NK-1 receptors were found over the endothelium of arterial blood vessels within the detrusor muscle and lamina propria, and over small vessels in the subepithelium. NK-2 receptors were seen over the detrusor muscle and very sparsely over blood vessels, whereas CGRP receptors were expressed densely over the smooth muscle layer of arteries and arterioles, and weakly over collecting venules. NK-1 and CGRP receptors were not observed over the detrusor muscle. Conclusions: Although the afferent nerves contain all three peptides, not all cell types express receptors for each peptide. The general distribution of receptors is in good agreement with the location of nerves, and with the known actions of SP and CGRP as vasodilator agents, and of NKA (but not SP or CGRP) in contracting the detrusor muscle.

Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Targeted Deep Tumor Penetration of Polymer Nanocarriers	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						positron emission tomography (PET) imaging; prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA); polymer nanocarriers; deep tumor penetration; enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect	LU-177-PSMA-617 RADIOLIGAND THERAPY; ENHANCED PERMEABILITY; HIGH-AFFINITY; GERMAN MULTICENTER; CANCER; PSMA; INHIBITORS; PET; NANOPARTICLES; LOCALIZATION	Tumoral uptake of large-size nanoparticles is mediated by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, with variable accumulation and heterogenous tumor tissue penetration depending on the tumor phenotype. The performance of nanocarriers via specific targeting has the potential to improve imaging contrast and therapeutic efficacy in vivo with increased deep tissue penetration. To address this hypothesis, we designed and synthesized prostate cancer-targeting starPEG nanocarriers (40 kDa, 15 nm), [89Zr]PEG-(DFB)3(ACUPA)1 and [89Zr]PEG-(DFB)1(ACUPA)3 , with one or three prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeting ACUPA ligands. The in vitro PSMA binding affinity and in vivo pharmacokinetics of the targeted nanocarriers were compared with a nontargeted starPEG, [89Zr]PEG-(DFB)4 , in PSMA+ PC3-Pip and PSMA- PC3-Flu cells, and xenografts. Increasing the number of ACUPA ligands improved the in vitro binding affinity of PEG derived polymers to PC3-Pip cells. While both PSMA-targeted nanocarriers significantly improved tissue penetration in PC3-Pip tumors, the multivalent [89Zr]PEG-(DFB)1(ACUPA)3 showed a remarkably higher PC3-Pip/blood ratio and background clearance. In contrast, the nontargeted [89Zr]PEG-(DFB)4 showed low EPR-mediated accumulation with poor tumor tissue penetration. Overall, ACUPA conjugated targeted starPEGs significantly improve tumor retention with deep tumor tissue penetration in low EPR PC3-Pip xenografts. These data suggest that PSMA targeting with multivalent ACUPA ligands may be a generally applicable strategy to increase nanocarrier delivery to prostate cancer. These targeted multivalent nanocarriers with high tumor binding and low healthy tissue retention could be employed in imaging and therapeutic applications.

Introduction of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-based radiotracers for imaging and therapy had gained increasing attention in recent years. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with Ga68 PSMA is the most promising technique, but PSMA-based radiotracers SPECT imaging with low dose of 177Lu-PSMA when PET imaging is not available may also be considered. The goal of the study is to evaluate the sensitivity of 177Lu_psma for detection of metastatic sites in patients with biochemical relapse and negative conventional (MRI, MRS, CT scan and bone scintigraphy) imaging. Materials & methods: 26 patients with biochemical recurrence after curative (surgery and/or radiotherapy) therapy, which had previous negative imaging as pelvic CT scan, pelvic MRI, MRS and bone scan, were enrolled in this clinical imaging approach between 2015 and 2017.After injection of 5 mCi (185MBq)177Lu-PSMA-617, diagnostic planar whole body scan and SPECT study was obtained after 3 hours, 24 hours and 72 hours. The images were analyzed visually by an expert nuclear medicine physician for the presence of active regional or distant lesions. Results were then prospectively checked by new CT scan images as a control. Result: A total of 26 patients, with a mean age of 70 years (range: 46 to 89 years) were included in this study. The overall detection rates were 38.5% (10 out of 26 patients). Most common site of detected lesions was lung in 6 patients, abdominal lymph nodes in 2 and mediastinum in another 2 patients. Conclusion: 177Lu-PSMA SPECT scan can help detecting metastatic lesions in more than one third of patients with biochemical recurrence and negative conventional investigations, when 68Ga-PSMA PET is not available.

Regulation of human brown adipose tissue by adenosine and A<sub>2A</sub> receptors - studies with [<SUP>15</SUP>O]H<sub>2</sub>O and [<SUP>11</SUP>C]TMSX PET/CT	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						Brown adipose tissue; Adenosine; A(2A) receptor; Perfusion; Physiology; Positron emission tomography; [C-11]TMSX; [O-15]H2O	BLOOD-FLOW; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; LIPID-METABOLISM; COLD; ACTIVATION; PERFUSION	PurposeBrown adipose tissue (BAT) has emerged as a potential target to combat obesity and diabetes, but novel strategies to activate BAT are needed. Adenosine and A(2A) receptor (A2AR) agonism activate BAT in rodents, and endogenous adenosine is released locally in BAT as a by-product of noradrenaline, but physiological data from humans is lacking. The purpose of this pilot study was to investigate the effects of exogenous adenosine on human BAT perfusion, and to determine the density of A2ARs in human BAT in vivo for the first time, using PET/CT imaging.MethodsHealthy, lean men (n=10) participated in PET/CT imaging with two radioligands. Perfusion of BAT, white adipose tissue (WAT) and muscle was quantified with [O-15]H2O at baseline, during cold exposure and during intravenous administration of adenosine. A2AR density of the tissues was quantified with [C-11]TMSX at baseline and during cold exposure.ResultsAdenosine increased the perfusion of BAT even more than cold exposure (baseline 8.34.5, cold 19.6 +/- 9.3, adenosine 28.6 +/- 7.9ml/100g/min, p<0.01). Distribution volume of [C-11]TMSX in BAT was significantly lower during cold exposure compared to baseline. In cold, low [C-11]TMSX binding coincided with high concentrations of noradrenaline.ConclusionsAdenosine administration caused a maximal perfusion effect in human supraclavicular BAT, indicating increased oxidative metabolism. Cold exposure increased noradrenaline concentrations and decreased the density of A2AR available for radioligand binding in BAT, suggesting augmented release of endogenous adenosine. Our results show that adenosine and A2AR are relevant for activation of human BAT, and A2AR provides a future target for enhancing BAT metabolism.

Mutagenesis Analysis Reveals Distinct Amino Acids of the Human Serotonin 5-HT<sub>2c</sub> Receptor Underlying the Pharmacology of Distinct Ligands	ACS CHEMICAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Serotonin; 5-HT2c receptor; mutagenesis; pharmacology; drug discovery	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; FUNCTIONAL SELECTIVITY; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; BETA(2) ADRENOCEPTOR; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; STRUCTURAL BASIS; INVERSE AGONIST; GPCR ACTIVATION; BINDING POCKET; DRUG DESIGN	While exploring the structure activity relationship of 4-phenyl-2-dimethylaminotetralins (PATs) at serotonin 5-HT2c receptors, we discovered that relatively minor modification of PAT chemistry impacts function at 5-HT2c receptors. In HEK293 cells expressing human 5-HT2c-INI receptors, for example, (-)-trans-3'-CF3-PAT and (-)-trans-3'-CI-PAT are agonists regarding G alpha(q)-inositol phosphate signaling, whereas (-)-trans-3'-CF3-PAT is an inverse agonist. To investigate the ligand receptor interactions that govern this change in function, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of 14 amino acids of the 5HT(2c) receptor based on molecular modeling and reported G protein-coupled receptor crystal structures, followed by molecular pharmacology studies. We found that 53.36, T3.37, and F5.47 in the orthosteric binding pocket are critical for affinity (K-D) of all PATs tested, we also found that F6.44, M6.47, C7.45, and 57.46 are primarily involved in regulating EC/IC50 functional potencies of PATs. We discovered that when residue 55.43, N6.55, or both are mutated to alanine, (-)-trans-3',CF3-PAT switches from inverse agonist to agonist function, and when N6.55 is mutated to leucine, (-)-trans-3'-Br-PAT switches from agonist to inverse agonist function. Notably, most point-mutations that affected PAT pharmacology did not significantly alter affinity (K-D) of the antagonist radioligand [H-3]mesulergine, but every mutation tested negatively impacted serotonin binding. Also, amino acid mutations differentially affected the pharmacology of other commercially available 5-HT2c ligands tested. Collectively, the data show that functional outcomes shared by different ligands are mediated by different amino acids and that some 5-HT2c receptor residues important for pharmacology of one ligand are not necessarily important for another ligand.

The aim of the study was to identify CD in an HLA-genotyped birth cohort prospectively screened for CD.Methods:In the initial screening, 13,860 HLA-DQ-genotyped children were invited, of whom 3435/13,860 (25%) accepted participation. Of the 3435, 1620 (47%) carried DQ2 and/or DQ8, of whom 73 (4.5%) were tTGA positive assessed in radioligand-binding assays and 56 (3.5%) developed CD. At age 9 years, 13,024 children from the original cohort were re-invited to follow-up screening using the same study protocol and tTGA assays as in the first screening. Diagnosis of CD was confirmed by intestinal biopsy in children with persistent tTGA.Results:In the follow-up screening, 1910/4077 (46.8%) carried DQ2 and/or DQ8, of whom 79/1910 (4.1%) were persistently tTGA positive and 72/1907 (3.8%) developed CD. Only 1/2167 (0.05%) child without HLA risk was IgG-tTGA positive, but did not have CD. Of the 980/1910 (51%) children carrying DQ2 and/or DQ8 who were already screened at 3 years of age, 30/979 (3.1%) were diagnosed as new patients at 9 years of age, compared with 42/928 (4.5%) children who did not participate in the initial screening (P=0.094).Conclusions:Screening for CD can be restricted to children carrying HLA-DQ2 and/or DQ8. Repeated screening using tTGA is necessary to identify new patients by 9 years of age. These findings may be relevant when considering implementing screening of the general population.

Dementia with Lewy bodies can be well-differentiated from Alzheimer's disease by measurement of brain acetylcholinesterase activity-a [<SUP>11</SUP>C]MP4A PET study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						dementia with Lewy bodies; Alzheimer's disease; differential diagnosis; positron emission tomography; [C-11]MP4A; acetylcholinesterase activity	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; BODY DISEASE; GLUCOSE-METABOLISM; TAU PATHOLOGY; DIAGNOSIS; BETA; RADIOACTIVITY; RADIOLIGAND; IMPAIRMENT	Objective: To investigate the diagnostic performance of brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity measurement using N-[C-11]-methyl-4-piperidyl acetate (MP4A) and PET in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: Participants were 14 DLB patients, 25 AD patients and 18 age-matched healthy controls (HC). All subjects underwent PET scans and MP4A to measure regional brain AChE activity. We performed anatomical standardization of each brain image, and k(3) values, an index of AChE activity, in each voxel were estimated by nonlinear least squares analysis. Volumes of interest (VOIs) were identified on parametric k(3) images in frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital cortices, and in anterior and posterior cingulate gyri (ACG and PCG). In each VOI, the differential diagnostic performance between AD and DLB of k(3) values was assessed by area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristic. Voxel-based statistical analyses were also performed. Results: Mean cortical AChE activities in AD patients (-8.2% compared with normal mean) and DLB patients (-27.8%) were lower than HCs (p<0.05, p<0.001, respectively). There was a significant difference in mean cortical AChE activities between AD and DLB patients (p<0.001). All regional brain AChE activities of defined VOIs except ACG were able to well discriminate DLB from AD, and notably performance was the most significant in PCG (AUC=0.989, 95% CI: 0.965-1.000). Conclusions: Brain cholinergic deficit is consistently prominent in DLB compared with AD. PET measurement of brain AChE activity may be useful for the differential diagnosis between DLB and AD.

The antagonist affinity of ibodutant was evaluated through concentration-dependent inhibition curves at the [I-125]NKA specific binding by using membranes prepared from human colon smooth muscle. In this assay the affinity of ibodutant (pK(i) 9.9) was compared to that of other two selective NK2 receptor antagonists, nepadutant (pK(i) 8.4) and saredutant (pK(i) 9.2). The antagonist potency of ibodutant was evaluated towards the [beta Ala(8)]NKA(4-10)-mediated contractions of human colon smooth muscle strips. In this assay ibodutant (3, 10, 30 and 100 nM) induced a concentration-dependent rightward shift of the [beta Ala(8)]NKA(4-10) concentration-response curves without depressing the maximal contractile effect. The analysis of the curves yielded a Schild-plot linear regression with a slope not different from unity (1.02), thus indicating a surmountable antagonist behavior. The calculated apparent antagonist potency as pK(B) value was 9.1. No sex related differences were observed in NK2 receptor pharmacology for [beta Ala(8)]NKA(4-10) or ibodutant in colonic strips obtained from male or female patients. Reversibility experiments of tachykinin NK2 receptor blockade indicated that the inhibition of the agonist-induced contractions in preparations pre-exposed to ibodutant, and afterwards subjected to repeated washing cycles remained almost constant showing no sign of recovery during the 3 h observation period. Overall, the present study indicates ibodutant as a potent tachykinin NK2 receptor antagonist in the human colon tissue, also endowed with a persistent duration of action. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Main methods: The memory-enhancing effects of crebanine were assessed with a water maze test using scopolamine-induced amnesic mice. The molecular mechanism was explored in silico by docking crebanine against acetylcholine binding proteins (AChBPs) and in vitro with a radioligand competition assay using (+/-)-[H-3]-epibatidine. The pharmacological behavior was assessed by observing changes to the functional activity of alpha 7-nAChRs expressed in Xenopus oocytes and by fluorescent assays on recombinant ligand gated ion channel (LGIC) receptors expressed in mammalian cells. Key findings: The administration of crebanine significantly improved the cognitive deficits induced by scopolamine, as measured by the water maze test. The docking results demonstrated that crebanine bound to the active binding site of the AChBP template with a good docking energy. Crebanine significantly inhibited the binding of (+/-)-[H-3]-epibatidine to AChBPs with K-i values of 179 nM and 538 nM for Ls and Ac, respectively. Further functional assays performed using two separate protocols indicated that crebanine is an antagonist of the alpha 7-nAChR with an IC50 of 19.1 mu M. Significance: The observed actions of crebanine against amnesia and its effect on alpha a-nAChRs will be beneficial for target-based drug design: crebanine or its scaffold can be used as the starting point to develop a drug for Alzheimer's disease. The cognition-enhancing effects of crebanine and the underlying mechanism based on a7-nAChRs are consistent with its traditional use. These findings demonstrate the potential utility of crebanine in the development of neurodegenerative therapy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A Single Administration of Low-Dose Varenicline Saturates α4β2* Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors in the Human Brain	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						cigarettes; nicotinic receptors; addiction; varenicline; withdrawal; thalamus	PARTIAL AGONIST VARENICLINE; IN-VIVO; WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS; BINDING-PROPERTIES; SMOKING-CESSATION; PRENATAL-EXPOSURE; MATERNAL-SMOKING; DRUG-USE; TOBACCO; DESENSITIZATION	The primary objective of this project was to determine the alpha 4 beta 2* nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) occupancy in human brain of a single low dose of varenicline (0.5 mg), and to explore the relationship between receptor occupancy by varenicline and tobacco withdrawal symptoms (*denoting other putative nAChR subunits). Otherwise healthy smokers (n = 9) underwent two positron emission tomography (PET) sessions with the selective alpha 4 beta 2* radioligand 2-FA. For the PET sessions, participants received either a low dose of varenicline (0.5 mg) or matching placebo pill (double-blind, random order) before imaging. For both sessions, participants received bolus plus continuous infusions of 2-FA, were scanned for 1 h after allowing the radiotracer to reach a steady state, smoked to satiety, and were scanned for 2 more hours. We estimated the fractional receptor occupancy by a single dose of varenicline (0.5 mg) and the corresponding varenicline dissociation constant (K-V), along with the effect of low-dose varenicline, pill placebo, and smoking-to-satiety on withdrawal rating scales. The data are compatible with 100% occupancy of alpha 4 beta 2* nAChRs by a single dose of varenicline, with a 90% lower confidence limit of 89% occupancy for the thalamus and brainstem. The corresponding 90% upper limit on effective K-V with respect to plasma varenicline was 0.49 nM. Smoking to satiety, but not low-dose varenicline, significantly reduced withdrawal symptoms. Our findings demonstrate that low-dose varenicline results in saturation of alpha 4 beta 2* nAChRs in the thalamus and brainstem without reducing withdrawal symptoms.

Anti-Idiotypic Antibody Specific to GAD65 Autoantibody Prevents Type 1 Diabetes in the NOD Mouse	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SYSTEMIC-LUPUS-ERYTHEMATOSUS; ANTIRIBOSOMAL P AUTOANTIBODIES; ANTIGEN-PRESENTING CELLS; ACID DECARBOXYLASE GAD; GRAVES-DISEASE; DNA ANTIBODIES; B-LYMPHOCYTES; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODIES; IDIOTYPIC ANTIBODIES; NETWORK THEORY	Overt autoantibodies to the smaller isoform of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD65Ab) are a characteristic in patients with Type 1 diabetes (T1D). Anti-idiotypic antibodies (anti-Id) directed to GAD65Ab effectively prevent the binding of GAD65 to GAD65Ab in healthy individuals. Levels of GAD65Ab-specific anti-Id are significantly lower in patients with T1D, leading to overt GAD65Ab in these patients. To determine the possible protective role of GAD65Ab-specific anti-Id in T1D pathogenesis, we developed the monoclonal anti-Id MAb 8E6G4 specifically targeting human monoclonal GAD65Ab b96.11. MAb 8E6G4 was demonstrated as a specific anti-Id directed to the antigen binding site of b96.11. MAb 8E6G4 recognized human antibodies in sera from healthy individuals, T2D patients, and T1D patients as established by ELISA. We confirmed these MAb 8E6G4-bound human antibodies to contain GAD65Ab by testing the eluted antibodies for binding to GAD65 in radioligand binding assays. These findings confirm that GAD65Ab are present in sera of individuals, who test GAD65Ab-negative in conventional detection assays. To test our hypothesis that GAD65Ab-specific anti-Id have an immune modulatory role in T1D, we injected young Non Obese Diabetic (NOD) mice with MAb 8E6G4. The animals were carefully monitored for development of T1D for 40 weeks. Infiltration of pancreatic islets by mononuclear cells (insulitis) was determined to establish the extent of an autoimmune attack on the pancreatic islets. Administration of MAb 8E6G4 significantly reduced the cumulative incidence rate of T1D and delayed the time of onset.

Functioning of 5HT-1A receptor has been suggested as a modulator of emotional balance in both, normal and pathological forms of anxiety. Here, we studied serotonergic modulation of anxiety-like behaviour using a genetic rat model with constitutional differences in 5HT homeostasis, named Wistar-Zagreb 5HT (WZ-5HT) rats. The model, consisting of high-5HT and low-5HT sublines, was developed by selective breeding of animals for extreme activities of peripheral (platelet) 5HT transporter, but selection process had affected also central 5HT homeostasis, as evidenced from neurochemical and behavioural studies. Anxiety-like behaviour in WZ-5HT rats was evaluated by two commonly used paradigms: open field and elevated-plus maze. The involvement of 5HT-1A receptors in behavioural response was assessed by measuring mRNA expression in cell bodies (raphe nuclei) and projection regions (frontal cortex, hippocampus) by use of RT-PCR and in situ hybridization, and by measuring functionality of cortical 5HT-1A receptors by use of [H-3]8-OH-DPAT radioligand binding. Animals from the high-5HT subline exhibit increased anxiety-like behaviour and decreased exploratory activity when exposed to novel environment. No measurable differences in constitutional (baseline) functionality or expression of 5HT-1A receptors between sublines were found. The results support contribution of increased serotonergic functioning to the anxiety-like behaviour. They also validate the high-5HT subline of WZ-5HT rats as a potential model to study mechanisms of anxiety, especially of its nonpathological form, while the low-5HT subline may be useful to model sensation seeking phenotype.

A New <SUP>18</SUP>F-Labeled Folic Acid Derivative with Improved Properties for the PET Imaging of Folate Receptor Positive Tumors	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						folic acid; folate receptor; F-18; PET; pemetrexed	PRECLINICAL EVALUATION; BINDING PROTEIN; RADIOLIGAND; EXPRESSION; CANCER; F-18	The folate receptor is a proven target for folate-based diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Several folic acid conjugates have been developed as radiopharmaceuticals, but a suitable F-18-labeled folic acid derivative for routine clinical use is still lacking. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential of 2'-F-18-fluorofolic acid as a PET agent for folate receptor-positive tumors. Methods: The binding affinity of the cold reference compound 2'-fluorofolic acid was determined by in vitro displacement assays using human folate receptor-positive KB cells and H-3-folic acid. F-18 labeling of 2'-fluorofolic acid was accomplished via a direct nucleophilic aromatic substitution of N-2-(N,N-dimethylamino-methylene)-2'-nitrofolic acid di-tert-butylester followed by acidic cleavage of the amino and carboxylic protecting groups. The new radiofolate was evaluated in nude mice bearing KB tumor xenografts under control and blocking conditions. Animals were either scanned from 75 to 105 min after injection of the radiotracer or sacrificed 75 min after injection for ex vivo biodistribution studies. Results: 2'-fluorofolic acid showed a high binding affinity (inhibition constant, 1.8 +/- 0.1 nM) for the folate receptor. Direct aromatic F-18 labeling of 2'-fluorofolic acid was achieved within 80 min via a convenient 2-step procedure in satisfactory radiochemical yields. The new radiotracer exhibited excellent pharmacokinetics with fast renal clearance and only moderate hepatobiliary elimination. Uptake of 2'-F-18-fluorofolic acid in folate receptor-positive KB tumors was high and specific, allowing a clearcut visualization by PET. Conclusion: 2'-F-18-fluorofolic acid, obtained via an integrated approach, is a promising PET agent for folate receptor-positive tumors and outperforms previously reported F-18-labeled folates.

We have previously reported that phospholipase C-related inactive protein (PRIP) is a modulator of GABA(A) receptor trafficking and that knockout (KO) mice exhibit a diazepam-insensitive phenotype in the hippocampus. The alpha subunit affects diazepam sensitivity; alpha 1, 2, 3, and 5 subunits assemble with any form of beta and the gamma 2 subunits to produce diazepam-sensitive receptors, whereas alpha 4 or alpha 6/beta/gamma 2 receptors are diazepam-insensitive. Here, we investigated how PRIP is implicated in the diazepam-insensitive phenotype using cerebellar granule cells in animals expressing predominantly the alpha 6 subunit. The expression of alpha 1/beta/gamma 2 diazepam-sensitive receptors was decreased in the PRIP-1 and 2 double KO cerebellum without any change in the total number of benzodiazepine-binding sites as assessed by radioligand-binding assay. Since levels of the alpha 6 subunit were increased, the alpha 1/beta/gamma 2 receptors might be replaced with alpha 6 subunit-containing receptors. Then, we further performed autoradiographic and electrophysiologic analyses. These results suggest that the expression of alpha 6/delta receptors was decreased in cerebellar granule neurons, while that of alpha 6/gamma 2 receptors was increased. PRIP-1 and 2 double KO mice exhibit a diazepam-insensitive phenotype because of a decrease in diazepam-sensitive (alpha 1/gamma 2) and increase in diazepam-insensitive (alpha 6/gamma 2) GABA(A) receptors in the cerebellar granule cells.

Objectives: Our aim was to evaluate the effects of cannabinor, a novel CB2 receptor agonist, on rat bladder function. Design, setting, and participants: Sprague Dawley rats were used. Distribution of CB2 receptors in sensory and cholinergic nerves of the detrusor was studied. Selectivity of cannabinor for human and rat CB receptors was evaluated. Effects of cannabinor on rat detrusor and micturition were investigated. Measurements: Immunohistochemistry, radioligand binding, tritium outflow assays, organ bath studies of isolated bladder tissue, and cystometry in awake rats were used. Results and limitations: CB2 receptor immunoreactivity was expressed in the urothelium and in sensory and cholinergic bladder nerves. Cannabinor exhibited similar binding at human and rat CB2 receptors and a 321-fold functional selectivity for the CB2 receptor versus the CB1 receptor. Cannabinor had no effect on isolated detrusor muscle function. In vivo, cannabinor 3.0 mg/kg increased micturition intervals and volumes by 52% (p < 0.05) and 96% (p < 0.01), respectively, and increased threshold and flow pressures by 73% (p < 0.01) and 49% (p < 0.001), respectively. Cannabinor 0.3 or 1.0 mg/kg or vehicle did not affect urodynamic parameters. Conclusions: Considering that CB2 receptors are localized on sensory nerves and on the urothelium and that cannabinor had effects on "afferent'' urodynamic parameters, peripheral CB2 receptors may be involved in sensory functions of rat micturition. Effects of cannabinor on cholinergic nerve activity in normal bladder tissue appear to be limited. (c) 2010 European Association of Urology. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here we evaluate the new radiotracer for positron emission tomography (PET) [F-18]PBR111 in a rodent model of acute inflammation and compare it with [C-11]CLINME, an C-11-labelled tracer of the same chemical family, and with the isoquinolinic carboxamide [C-11]PK11195. We studied radiometabolites by HPLC, in vitro binding by autoradiography and in vivo brain kinetics as well as in vivo specificity of binding using PET imaging. We show that this radiotracer has a high in vitro specificity for PBR/TSPO versus central benzodiazepine receptors, as reflected by the drastic reduction of its binding to target tissue by addition of PK11195 or PBR111, while addition of flumazenil does not affect binding. Only intact [F-18]PBR111 is detected in brain up to 60 min after i.v. injection, and PET imaging shows an increased uptake in the lesion as compared to the contralateral side as early as 6 min after injection. Administration of an excess of PK11195 and PBR111, 20 min after [F-18]PBR111 administration, induces a rapid and complete displacement of [F-18]PBR111 binding from the lesion. Modelling of the PET data using the simplified reference tissue model showed increased binding potential (BP) in comparison to [C-11]PK11195. [F-18]PBR111 is a metabolically stable tracer with a high specific in vitro and in vivo binding to TSPO. In addition, considering the longer half-life of F-18 over C-11, these results support [F-18]PBR111 as a promising PET tracer of the PBR/TSPO for neuroinflammation imaging.

PET Imaging of the Effects of Age and Cocaine on the Norepinephrine Transporter in the Human Brain Using (S,S)-[<SUP>11</SUP>C]O-Methylreboxetine and HRRT	SYNAPSE			English	Article						norepinephrine transporter; cocaine abuse; (S,S)-[C-11]O-methylreboxetine; MRB; PET	LOCUS-CERULEUS; DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER; GENE-EXPRESSION; INDUCED REINSTATEMENT; HIGH-RESOLUTION; MESSENGER-RNA; RAT-BRAIN; BINDING; SITES; METHYLPHENIDATE	Objectives: The role of the norepinephrine transporter (NET) in cocaine dependence has never been demonstrated via in vivo imaging due to the lack of suitable NET radioligands. Here we report our preliminary studies evaluting the NET in individuals with cocaine dependence (COC) in comparison to healthy controls (HC) using (S,S)-[C-11]methylreboxetine ([C-11]MRB), the most promising C-11 labeled positron-emission tomography (PET) radioligand for NET developed to date. Methods: Twenty two human volunteers (10 COC and 12 HC) underwent dynamic C-11-MRB-PET acquisition using a High Resolution Research Tomograph (HRRT). Binding potential (BPND) parametric images were computed using the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM2) with occipital cortex as reference region. BPND values were compared between the two groups. Results: Locus coeruleus (LC), hypothalamus, and pulvinar showed a significant inverse correlation with age among HC (age range = 25-54 years; P = 0.04, 0.009, 0.03 respectively). The BPND was significantly increased in thalamus (27%; P < 0.02) and dorsomedial thalamic nuclei (30%; P < 0.03) in COC as compared to HC. Upon age normalization, the upregulation of NET in COC also reached significance in LC (63%, P < 0.01) and pulvinar (55%, P < 0.02) regions. Conclusion: Our results suggest that (a) brain NET concentration declines with age in HC, and (b) there is a significant upregulation of NET in thalamus and dorsomedial thalamic nucleus in COC as compared to HC. Our results also suggest that the use of [C-11]MRB and HRRT provides an effective strategy for studying alterations of the NET system in humans. Synapse 64:30-38, 2010. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

The diversity of the alpha subunits results in the various ligand selectivity and functionally different properties of the GABA(A)/BZ receptor. Although [C-11] Ro15-4513 is reported to be a radioligand that has relatively high affinity for alpha 5 subunit-containing GABA(A)/BZ receptor, it remained to be evaluated fully. Aim The aim of this study was to evaluate the quantitative analyses of [C-11]Ro15-4513 in the living human brain. Methods Positron emission tomography examinations were performed in eight healthy male volunteers after intravenous injection of [C-11]Ro15-4513. Kinetic analysis of data was performed with the two-compartment and three-compartment models using arterial input function. Linear graphical analysis and the simplified reference tissue model analysis (SRTM) were also performed using Pons as a reference region. In a simulation study, the effects of noise to the estimation of binding potentials were evaluated. Results The accumulation of [C-11]Ro15-4513 in the limbic system was relatively higher than in other cortex. The bindings were well described by the three-compartment model in the regions with specific binding. Binding potentials obtained from the graphical method and SRTM correlated well with those obtained from the three-compartment model. In the simulation study, estimated parameters from SRTM were less affected by noise compared with those from the graphical method. Conclusion The reference tissue methods using pons as a reference region can be used for quantitative analysis of [C-11]Ro15-4513 binding. SRTM seemed less susceptible to noise than does graphical analysis. Nucl Med Commun 30:872-880 (C) 2009 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Characterization of breast cancer subtypes by quantitative assessment of biological parameters: Relationship with clinicopathological characteristics, biological features and prognosis	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY			English	Article						Breast cancer; Epidermal growth factor receptor; HER1; HER2; Prognosis	BASAL-LIKE SUBTYPE; EXPRESSION PATTERNS; MOLECULAR PORTRAITS; SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION; EGF-RECEPTOR; CARCINOMAS; TUMORS; CLASSIFICATION; SUBCLASSES; PHENOTYPE	Objectives: Gene expression analysis has identified several breast cancer subtypes, including luminal. epidermal growth factor receptor-2 positive (HER2+), and basal-like. To determine if our proposed molecular taxonomy correlates with biological and clinical behavior. This is based on four biological markers: estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR, respectively), HER2 and the epidermal growth factor receptor-1 (HER1), all of them being determined by quantitative assays. Study design: The biological parameters were examined by enzyme immunoassay, radioligand-binding assay or ELISA, in tumors from 787 patients with invasive breast cancer. Patients were prospectively evaluated over a median follow-up period of 50 months. Subtype definitions were as follows: luminal (ER+), HER2+ (HER2+, ER-, PgR-) and basal-like (HER2-, ER-, PgR-). In addition, we divided basal tumors into two groups based on their HER1 status. Results: A 55.8% Of tumors were of luminal type, 11.9% basal-like HER1+, 10.7 basal-like HER1-, and the remainder 21.6% HER2+. Both HER2+ and basal-like subtypes were more frequent in younger and premenopausal women, showing a higher percentage of cases of poorly differentiated tumors and higher S-phase fraction, when compared with those of luminal subtype. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the subtype Of tumor was related to both relapse and overall survival, being those of luminal subtype associated with the best prognosis. Conclusions: Through the classification of breast tumors in four groups, according to their ER, PgR, HER2 and HER1 status, it is possible to obtain a major division of breast tumors associated with significant differences in biological features and clinical behavior.

In the CNS, I-125-alpha-bungarotoxin is commonly used to identify alpha 7 nAChRs specifically. However, alpha-bungarotoxin also interacts potently with alpha 1* and alpha 9 alpha 10 nAChRs, two receptor subtypes in peripheral tissues that are colocalized with the alpha 7 subtype. [H-3] Methyllycaconitine is also frequently used as an alpha 7-selective antagonist, but it has significant affinity for alpha 6* and alpha 9 alpha 10 nAChR subtypes. In this study, we have developed a highly alpha 7-selective alpha-conotoxin radioligand by iodination of a naturally occurring histidine. Both mono-and diiodo derivatives were generated and purified (specific activities were 2200 and 4400 Ci mmol(-1), respectively). The properties of the mono- and diiodo derivatives were very similar to each other, but the diiodo was less stable. For monoidodo peptide, saturation binding to mouse hippocampal membranes demonstrated a K-d value of 1.15 +/- 0.13 nM, similar to that of I-125-alpha-bungarotoxin in the same preparations (0.52 +/- 0.16 nM). Association and dissociation kinetics were relatively rapid (k(obs) for association at 1 nM was 0.027 +/- 0.007 min(-1); k(off) = 0.020 +/- 0.001 min(-1)). Selectivity was confirmed with autoradiography using alpha 7-null mutant tissue: specific binding was abolished in all regions of alpha 7(-/-) brains, whereas wild-type mice expressed high levels of labeling and low nonspecific binding. I-125-alpha-conotoxin ArlB[V11L; V16A] should prove useful where alpha 7 nAChRs are coexpressed with other subtypes that are also labeled by existing ligands. Furthermore, true equilibrium binding experiments could be performed on alpha 7 nAChRs, something that is impossible with I-125-alpha-bungarotoxin.	[Christensen, Sean; Dowell, Cheryl; McIntosh, J.

ZOL displayed a much higher binding affinity for human ER alpha and ER beta than ZEN did. The IC50 values of ZEN and ZOL for binding to human ER alpha were 240.4 and 21.79 nM, respectively, and the IC50 Values for binding to ER beta were 165.7 and 42.76 nM, respectively. In ovariectomized female ICR mice, s.c. administration of ZEN at doses >= 2 mg/kg/day for 3 consecutive days significantly increased uterine wet weight compared with the control group, and administration of ZOL increased the uterine wet weight at lower doses (>= 0.5 mg/kg/day for 3 days). Based on available X-ray crystal structures of human ER alpha and ER beta, we have also conducted molecular modeling studies to probe the binding characteristics of ZEN and ZOL for human ER alpha and ER beta. Our data revealed that ZEN and ZOL were able to occupy the active site of the human ER alpha and ER beta in a strikingly similar manner as 17 beta-estradiol, such that the phenolic rings of ZEN and ZOL occupied the same receptor region as occupied by the A-ring of 17 beta-estradiol. The primary reason that ZOL and ZEN is less potent than 17 beta-estradiol is likely because 17 beta-estradiol could bind to the receptor pocket without significantly changing its conformation, while ZOL or ZEN would require considerable conformational alterations upon binding to the estrogen receptors (ERs).

The fluoroethyl analog, FE-SA4503, is described as having high primary affinity for sigma(2) sites (IC50 = 2.11 nM) and a weaker interaction with sigma(1), sites (IC50 = 6.48 nM). SA4503 and FE-SA4503 have been radiolabeled for PET studies, and both bind selectively to cri receptors in animal and human brain in vivo. We prepared SA4503 and FE-SA4503 as reference compounds for radioligand development efforts. In our hands, SA4503 is 14-fold selective for sigma(1), (K-i = 4.6 nM) over sigma(2) (Ki = 63.1 nM) sites in guinea pig brain homogenates. Further, FE-SA4503 exhibits the same 14-fold selectivity for sigma(1) (Ki = 8.0 nM) over sigma(2) (Ki = 113.2 nM) receptors. The main differences from previously reported values stem from sigma(2) affinity determinations. This protocol, displacement of [H-3]DTG binding to sigma(2) sites using (+)-pentazocine (200 nM) to mask sigma(1), sites, was validated by the proper rank order Of sigma(2) inhibitory potencies shown by a panel of additional ligands: ifenprodil > haloperidol > DTG > (+)-pentazocine. Robust Pearson correlation (r = 1.0, P = 0.002; slope = 0.97) was observed for our pK(i) values against those from a prior study by others. The findings have bearing on structure-activity relationships for this active series, and on conclusions that might be drawn from experiments relying upon defined sigma(1)/sigma(2) binding selectivity.

While many prescription drugs are used to treat insomnia, extracts of valerian (Valeriana officinalis L., Valerianaceae) are also used for the treatment of insomnia and restlessness. To determine novel mechanisms of action, radioligand binding studies were performed with valerian extracts (100% methanol, 50% methanol, dichloromethane [DCM], and petroleum ether [PE]) at the melatonin, glutamate, and GABA(A) receptors, and 8 serotonin receptor subtypes. Both DCM and PE extracts had strong binding affinity to the 5-HT5a receptor, but only weak binding affinity to the 5-HT2b and the serotonin transporter. Subsequent binding studies focused on the 5-HT5a receptor due to the distribution of this receptor in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the brain, which is implicated in the sleep-wake cycle. The PE extract inhibited [H-3]lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) binding to the human 5-HT5a receptor (86% at 50 mu g/ml) and the DCM extract inhibited LSD binding by 51%. Generation of an IC50 curve for the PE extract produced a biphasic curve, thus GTP shift experiments were also performed. In the absence of GTP, the competition curve was biphasic (two affinity sites) with an IC50 of 15.7 ng/ml for the high-affinity state and 27.7 mu g/ml for the low-affinity state. The addition of GTP (100 AM) resulted in a right-hand shift of the binding curve with an IC50 of 11.4 mu g/ml. Valerenic acid, the active constituent of both extracts, had an IC50 of 17.2 mu M. These results indicate that valerian and valerenic acid are new partial agonists of the 5-HT5a receptor. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The rationally designed 8-chloro-2-(4-methoxy-phenyl)-1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-a]quinoxalin-4-acetylamine (14) can be considered one of the most potent and hA(3) versus hA(1) selective AR antagonists reported till now. The structure-activity relationships of compounds 2-18 are in agreement with those of previously reported 2-aryl-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalines (series A) and 2-arylpyrazolo[3,4-c]quinolines (series B), thus suggesting a similar AR binding mode. In fact, the importance for the A(3) receptor-ligand interaction of both a strong acidic NH proton donor and a C=O proton acceptor at position-4, able to engage hydrogen-bonding interactions with specific sites on the A(3) AR, has been confirmed. Using our recently published hA(3) receptor model, to better elucidate our experimental results, we decided to theoretically depict the putative TM binding motif of the herein reported 1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-a]quinoxaline derivatives on human A(3) receptor. Structure-activity relationships have been explained analyzing the three-dimensional structure of the antagonist-receptor models obtained by molecular docking simulation. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper describes the chemical synthesis. resolution and determination of binding affinity for four enantiomeric pairs of derivatives. Their intrinsic affinities were determined by competition against binding of [H-3]vesamicol to human VAChT. Of the eight enantiomers, (E)-(R,R)-5-AOIBV [(R.R)-3], and (R.R)-5-FPOBV [(R,R)-4] displayed the highest binding affinities for VAChT (K-d = 0.45 and 0.77 nM. respectively), which indicated that an elongation of the chain from 5-idodo as in the case of 5-iodobenzovesamicol (5-1BVM). to a 5-(E)-3-iodoallyloxy or 5-fluoropropoxysubstituent, as in 5-AOIBV and 5-FPOBV, respectively, was very well tolerated at the vesamicol binding site. The enantiomer (RR)-4-MAlBV [(R,R)-16]. which retains the basic structure of (-)-5-IBVM but possess an additional aminomethyl substituent in the 4-position of the piperidine ring, displayed lower binding affinity (K-d = 8.8 nM). Nevertheless. the result suggests that substituation at this position may be an interesting alternative to investigate for development of new benzovesamicol analogues. As expected, the corresponding (S,S) enantiomers displayed lower K-d values, they were approximately 10-fold lower in the case of (S,S)-5-FPOBV (K-d = 8.4 nM) and (E)-(S.S)-5-AOIBV (K-d = 4.3 nM). (R,R)-3. and (R.R)-4 showed the same high affinity for VAChT as (-)-5-IBVM and may be suitable as imaging agents of cholinergic nerve terminals. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Its transport activity is effectively inhibited by cardiac glycosides, which bind to the extracellular side of the enzyme and are of significant therapeutic value in the treatment of congestive heart failure. To determine the extent to which high-affinity binding of cardiac glycosides correlates with their potency in inhibiting pump activity, we determined experimentally both the binding affinities and inhibitory potencies of a series of 37 cardiac glycosides using radioligand binding and ATPase activity assays. The observed variations in key structural elements of these compounds correlating with binding and inhibition were analyzed by comparative molecular similarity index analysis (CoMSIA), which allowed a molecular level characterization and comparison of drug- Na/K-ATPase interactions that are important for ligand binding and activity inhibition. In agreement with our earlier comparative molecular field analysis studies [Farr, C. D., et al. (2002) Biochemistry 47, 1137- 1148], the CoMSIA models predicted favorable inhibitor interactions primarily at the cc-sugar and lactone ring moieties of the cardiac glycosides. Unfavorable interactions were located about the gamma-sugar group and at several positions about the steroid ring system. Whereas for most compounds a correlation between binding affinity and inhibitory potency was found, some notable exceptions were identified. Substitution of the five-membered lactone of cardenolides with the six-membered lactone of bufadienolides caused binding affinity to decline but inhibitory potency to increase. Furthermore, while the removal of ouabain's rhamnose moiety had little effect on inhibitory potency, it caused a dramatic decline in ligand binding affinity.

AT(1) receptors are involved in the pathogenesis of several cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and congestive heart failure, which are characterized by significant interindividual variation in disease risk, progression, and response to pharmacotherapy. Such variation could arise from genomic polymorphisms in the AT(1) receptor. To pursue this notion, we have pharmacologically characterized seven known and putative nonsynonymous AT(1) receptor variants. Functional analysis using the cell-based assay receptor selection and amplification technology (R-SAT) revealed that three variants (AT(1)-G45R, AT(1)-F204S, and AT(1)-C289W) displayed altered responses to Ang II and other AT(1) receptor agonists and antagonists. Agonist responses to Ang II were absent for AT(1)-G45R and significantly reduced in potency for AT(1)-C289W (11-fold) and AT(1)-F204S (57-fold) compared with the wild-type (WT) receptor. AT(1)-F204S also displayed reduced relative efficacy (57%). Quantitatively similar results were obtained in two additional functional assays, phosphatidyl inositol hydrolysis and extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation. Radioligand binding studies revealed that AT(1)-G45R failed to bind Ang II, whereas cell surface staining clearly showed that it trafficked to the cell surface. AT(1)-C289W and AT(1)-F204S displayed reduced binding affinities of 3- and 5-fold and reduced cell surface expression of 43 and 60% of that observed for the WT receptor, respectively. These data demonstrate that polymorphic variation in the human AT(1) receptor induces loss of functional phenotypes, which may constitute the molecular basis of variability of AT(1) receptor-mediated physiological responses.

In order to support an IND application for the characterization of [F-18]FPS through PET imaging studies in humans, single organ and whole body radiation adsorbed doses associated with [F-18]FPS injection were estimated from distribution data obtained in rats. In addition, acute toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits and limited toxicity analyses were performed in dogs. Radiation dosimetry estimates obtained using rat biodistribution analysis of [F-18]FPS suggest that most organs would receive around 0.012-0.015 mGy/MBq. The adrenal glands, brain, kidneys, lungs. and spleen would receive slightly higher doses (0.02-0.03 mGy/MBq). The adrenal glands were identified as the organs receiving the greatest adsorbed radiation dose. The total exposure resulting from a 5 mCi administration of [F-18]FPS is well below the FDA defined limits for yearly cumulative and per study exposures to research participants. Extended acute toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, and limited acute toxicity studies in beagle dogs suggest at least a 175-fold safety margin in humans at a mass dose limit of 2.8 mug per intravenous injection. This estimate is based on the measured no observable effect doses (in mg/m(2)) in these species. These data support the expectation that [F-18]FPS will be safe for use in human PET imaging studies at a maximum administration of 5 mCi and a mass dose equal to or less than 2.8 mug FPS per injection.

Methods: Sodium-dependent monoamine uptake measurement, radioligand binding assays, microdialysis procedure, forced swimming test and conditioned fear stress test were carried out in rats. Results: Milnacipran selectively inhibited sodium-dependent [H-3]serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) and [H-3]noradrenaline (NA) uptake into the synaptosomes from rat cerebral cortex (IC50=28.0 and 29.6 nM, respectively) without any affinities for various neuroreceptors. In the medial prefrontal cortex, milnacipran (10 and 30 mg/kg, PO) caused a dose-related increase in the extracellular levels of 5-HT and NA with similar potency, whereas imipramine (10 and 30 mg/kg, PO) caused a dominant increase in the output of NA compared to 5-HT. Milnacipran (30 and 60 mg/kg, PO) significantly reduced the duration of both the immobility time in the forced swimming test and the freezing time in the conditioned fear stress test in rats, which are animal behavioral models for depression and anxiety, respectively. Imipramine and maprotiline were active in the former test, but not in the latter. Fluoxetine and fluvoxamine on the other hand were more active in the conditioned fear test. Conclusion: These findings show that milnacipran acts as a SNRI in vitro and in vivo and may be useful for the treatment of anxiety as well as depression.

Phylogenetic analysis showed with high bootstrap support that these genes represent one MC4 receptor and two MC5 receptors. Chromosomal mapping showed conserved synteny between regions containing zMC4 and human (h) MC4 receptors, whereas the two zMC5 receptor genes map on chromosome segments in which the zebrafish has several genes with two orthologues of a single mammalian gene. It is likely that the two copies of zMC5 receptors arose through a separate duplication in the teleost lineage. The zMC4, zMC5a, and zMC5b receptors share 70-71% overall amino acid identity with the respective human orthologues and over 90% in three TM regions believed to be most important for ligand binding. All three zebrafish receptors also show pharmacological properties remarkably similar to their human orthologues, with similar affinities and the same potency order, when expressed and characterized in radioligand binding assay for the natural melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) peptides alpha-, beta-, and gamma-MSH. Stimulation of transfected mammalian cells with alpha-MSH caused a dose-dependent increase in intracellular cAMP levels for all three zebrafish receptors. All three genes were expressed in the brain, eye, ovaries and gastrointestinal tract, whereas the zMC5b receptor was also found in the heart, as determined by RT-PCR. Our studies, which represent the first characterization of MC receptors in a nonamniote species, indicate that the MC receptor subtypes arose very early in vertebrate evolution. Important pharmacological and functional properties, as well as gene structure and syntenic relationships have been highly conserved over a period of more than 400 million years implying that these receptors participate in vital physiological functions.

A radioligand binding assay was used to determine whether changes in muscarinic receptor density and/or affinity occurred in the chick, retina, choroid and sclera during early post-hatching development or with the induction of myopia. Specific receptor binding sites were saturable with increasing concentrations of the muscarinic receptor ligand [H-3]N-methyl-scopolamine in the retina and choroid but not in the sclera. In normal eyes, binding density in the retina was not altered from age P5 to P10 (1447+/-14 vs. 411+/-13 fmol/mg of protein, P=0.07). However. in the choroid, the number of receptor binding sites significantly increased between P5 and P10 (637+/-39 vs. 1125+/-121 fmol/mg of protein. P<0.01). Binding affinity (K-D) was not altered with age in either the retina or choroid. Myopia was induced in chicks by deprivation of form vision, using translucent diffusers, from age P3. Despite the induction of significant degrees of ocular elongation and myopia at P5 (-8.7+/-0.3 D, P<0.01) and P10 (-22.5+/-1.3 D, P<0.01), neither muscarinic receptor density nor affinity were altered in the retina or choroid of myopic eyes. These findings, indicate that regulation of muscarinic receptor numbers in the chick choroid is occurring in normal post-hatching development of this tissue. However, myopic eye enlargement was not associated with changes in muscarinic receptor protein expression in the chick retina and choroid. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Thus, the effect of LH-RH antagonists is similar to that of the LH-RH agonists, but the mode of action of antagonists is not completely understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of LH-RH antagonist cetrorelix on the binding characteristics and subcellular localization of receptors for LH-RH in rat pituitaries. Radioligand binding studies, performed after in vitro desaturation, revealed that a single s.c. injection of cetrorelix at a dose of 100 mug per rat significantly decreased the number of pituitary membrane receptors for LH-RH in a time-dependent manner with the nadir occurring at 6 h. In contrast, 2-6 h after cetrorelix treatment, the concentration of binding sites for LH-RH in the nuclei of rat pituitaries was significantly higher (P < 0.01) than in controls, Chronic administration of cetrorelix also decreased the level of membrane receptors for LH-RH by 83% (P < 0.01) after 7 days, and 86% (P < 0.01) after 14 days. The number of LH-RH binding sites in the nuclear pellet was increased 3-fold (P < 0.01) by days 7 and 14 after the initiation of treatment with cetrorelix. A single injection or prolonged treatment with LH-RH antagonist also decreased the mRNA expression of pituitary receptors for LH-RH. Our results demonstrate that the down-regulation of LH-RH receptors on the cell membranes of rat pituitaries after therapy with antagonist cetrorelix is associated with an increase in receptor concentration in the nuclei. These phenomena could be related to the internalization and subcellular translocation of LH-RH receptors.

(-)-Isoprenaline mediated relaxation of ileum was antagonized weakly by ICI118551 (100 nM) (beta (2)-AR antagonist). Responses to (-)-isoprenaline were more strongly antagonized by CGP20712A (100 nM) (beta (1)-AR antagonist), propranolol (1 muM) (beta (1)-/beta (2)-AR antagonist), carvedilol (100 nM) (non-specific P-AR antagonist), and CGP12177A (100 nM) (beta (1)-/beta (2)-AR antagonist) in ileum from KO than in FVB mice. 3 Responses to CL316243 (B-AR agonist) in ileum from FVB mice were antagonized by SR59230A (100 nM) but not by propranolol (1 muM) or carvedilol (100 nM). CL316243 was ineffective in relaxing ileum from KO mice. 4 CGP12177A had no agonist actions in ileum from either KO or FVB mice. 5 PI-AR mRNA levels were increased 3 fold in ileum from KO compared to FVB mice. This was associated with an increased maximum number of beta (1)-/beta (2)-AR binding sites (B-max). beta (2)-AR mRNA levels were unaffected while no beta (3)-AR mRNA was detected in KO mice. 6 In mouse ileum, beta (3)-ARs and to a lesser extent beta (1)-ARs are the predominant adrenoceptor subtypes mediating relaxation in ileum from FVB mice. In KO mice beta (1)-ARs functionally compensate for the lack of beta (3)-ARs, and this is associated with increased beta (1)-AR mRNA and levels of binding.

Structure activity relationships of 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> serotonin receptor antagonists: N<SUP>6</SUP>, C2 and 5′-Modified (N)-methanocarba-adenosine derivatives	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Serotonin 5-HT2B receptor; Adenosine receptor; Functional antagonism; Radioligand binding; Nucleosides; Methanocarba; Serotonin receptor; G protein-coupled receptor; Scaffold repurposing; Structure activity relationship	ADENOSINE DERIVATIVES; NUCLEOSIDES; AGONISTS; SCAFFOLD; POTENT; A(1); SELECTIVITY; ALLODYNIA; EFFICACY; AFFINITY	(N)-Methanocarba adenosine derivatives were structurally modified to target 5-HT2B serotonin receptors as antagonists, predominantly containing branched N-6-alkyl groups. N-6-Dicycloalkyl-methyl groups, including their asymmetric variations, as well as 2-iodo, were found to generally favor 5-HT2Rs, while only N-6-dicyclohexyl-methyl derivative 35 showed weak 5-HT2AR affinity (K-i 3.6 mu M). The highest 5-HT2BR affinities were Ki 11-23 nM (N-6-dicyclopropyl-methyl-2-iodo 11, 2-chloro-5'-deoxy-5'-methylthio 15 and N-6-((R)-cyclobuty-cyclopropyl-methyl)-2-iodo 43), and K-i 73 nM at 5-HT2CR for 36. Direct comparison of adenine ribosides and their corresponding rigid (N)-methanocarba derivatives (cf. 51 and MRS8099 45) indicated a multifold affinity enhancement with the bicyclic ring system. Compounds 43, 45 and 48 were functional 5-HT2BR (K-B 2-3 nM) and 5-HT2CR (K-B 79-328 nM) antagonists in a G(q)-mediated calcium flux assay, with 5-HT2BR functional selectivity ranging from 45-(48) to 113-fold (43). Substantial adenosine receptor (AR) affinity (K-i, A(1)AR < K-i, A(3)AR < K-i, A(2A)AR) was still present in this series, suggestive of dual acting compounds: 5-HT2B antagonist and A(1)AR agonist, potentially useful for treating chronic conditions (fibrosis; pain). Given its affinity (17 nM) and moderate 5-HT2BR binding selectivity (32-fold vs. 5-HT2CR, 4-fold vs. A(1)AR), 43 (MRS7925) could potentially be useful for anti-fibrotic therapy.

Higher red blood cell (RBC) DHA in humans is associated with improved cognitive performance and a lower risk for suicide. Here, we hypothesized that binding to the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO), a proxy for microglia levels, will be higher in individuals with low DHA relative to high DHA levels. We also postulated that higher TSPO would predict poor cognitive performance and impaired stress resilience. METHODS: RBC DHA screening was performed in 320 healthy males. [C-11]PBR28 positron emission tomography was used to measure binding to TSPO in 38 and 32 males in the lowest and highest RBC DHA quartiles. Volumes of distribution expressed relative to total plasma ligand concentration (V-T) was derived using an arterial input function- based kinetic analysis in 14 brain regions. RESULTS: [C-11]PBR28 V-T was significantly lower (by 12% and 20% in C/T and C/C rs6971 genotypes) in males with low RBC DHA than in males with high RBC DHA. Regional V-T was correlated positively and negatively with RBC DHA and serum triglycerides, respectively. No relationships between V-T and cognitive performance or stress resilience measures were present. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to our hypothesis, we found lower TSPO binding in low-DHA than in high-DHA subjects. It is unclear as to whether low TSPO binding reflects differences in microglia levels and/or triglyceride metabolism in this study. Future studies with specific targets are necessary to confirm the effect of DHA on microglia. These results underscore the need to consider lipid parameters as a factor when interpreting TSPO positron emission tomography clinical findings.

These effects were prevented by the adenosine A(1) receptor antagonist DPCPX. Inosine at 300 (but not 100) mu M also decreased the magnitude of long-term potentiation (LTP), an effect prevented by DPCPX and by the adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonist SCH58261. Inosine showed low affinity towards human and rat adenosine receptor subtypes with K-i values of > 300 mu M; only at the human and rat A(1) receptor slightly higher affinities with K-i values of around 100 mu M were observed. Affinity of inosine at the rat A(3) receptor was higher (K-i of 1.37 mu M), while it showed no interaction with the human orthologue. Notably, the effects of inosine on synaptic transmission and plasticity were abrogated by adenosine deaminase and by inhibiting equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENT) with dipyridamole and NBTI. This shows that the impact of inosine on hippocampal synaptic transmission and plasticity is not due to a direct activation of adenosine receptors but is instead due to an indirect modification of the tonic activation of these adenosine receptors through an ENT-mediated modification of the extracellular levels of adenosine.

Neuroinflammation in World Trade Center responders at midlife: A pilot study using [18F]-FEPPA PET imaging	BRAIN, BEHAVIOR, & IMMUNITY - HEALTH			English	Article						World trade center; Neuroinflammation; Glial activation; Positron emission tomography; Translocator protein 18-kDa; Posttraumatic stress disorder	POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; VIVO RADIOLIGAND BINDING; COGSTATE BRIEF BATTERY; SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; MICROGLIAL ACTIVATION; HUMAN BRAIN; INFLAMMATION	Background: Neuroinflammation has long been theorized to arise from exposures to fine particulate matter and to be modulated when individuals experience chronic stress, both of which are also though to cause cognitive decline in part as a result of neuroinflammation. Objectives: Hypothesizing that neuroinflammation might be linked to experiences at the World Trade Center (WTC) events, this study explored associations between glial activation and neuropsychological measures including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity and WTC exposure duration. Methods: Translocator protein 18-kDa (TSPO) is overexpressed by activated glial cells, predominantly microglia and astrocytes, making TSPO distribution a putative biomarker for neuroinflammation. Twenty WTC responders completed neuropsychological assessments and in vivo PET brain scan with [18F]-FEPPA. Generalized linear modeling was used to test associations between PTSD, and WTC exposure duratiioni as the predictor and both global and regional [18F]-FEPPA total distribution volumes as the outcomes. Result: Responders were 56.0 & PLUSMN; 4.7 years-old, and 75% were police officers on 9/11/2001, and all had at least a high school education. Higher PTSD symptom severity was associated with global and regional elevations in [18F]-FEPPA binding predominantly in the hippocampus (d = 0.72, P = 0.001) and frontal cortex (d = 0.64, P = 0.004). Longer exposure duration to WTC sites was associated with higher [18F]-FEPPA binding in the parietal cortex. Conclusion: Findings from this study of WTC responders at midlife suggest that glial activation is associated with PTSD symptoms, and WTC exposure duration. Future investigation is needed to understand the important role of neuroinflammation in highly exposed WTC responders.

Hence, the development of selective agonist targeting hGPR40 has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Some agonists targeting hGPR40 were reported. The radioligand-binding studies and the crystal structures reveal that there are multiple sites on GPR40, and there exists positive binding cooperativity between the partial agonist MK-8666 and full allosteric agonist (AgoPAM) AP8. In this work, we carried out long-time Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD) simulations on hGPR40 to shed light on the mechanism of the cooperativity between the two agonists at different sites. Our results reveal that the induced-fit conformational coupling is bidirectional between the two sites. The movements and rotations of TM3, TM4, TM5 and TM6 due to their inherent flexibility are crucial in coupling the conformational changes of the two agonists binding sites. These helices adopt similar conformational states upon alternative ligand or both ligands binding. The Leu138(4.57), Leu186(5.42) and Leu190(5.46) play roles in coordinating the rearrangements of residues in the two pockets, which makes the movements of residues in the two sites like gear movements. These results provide detailed information at the atomic level about the conformational coupling between different sites of GPR40, and also provide the structural information for further design of new agonists of GPR40. In addition, these results suggest that it is necessary by considering the effect of other site bound in structure-based ligands discovery.

Most inactivating mutations cause receptor misfolding and prevent trafficking to the plasma membrane. Pharmacological chaperones can "rescue" cell surface expression of such mutants, presumably by stabilising correct folding of the nascent protein. Objective: Here we examine the scope of intracellularly retained luteinising hormone receptor (LHR) mutants that can be "rescued" by the pharmacological chaperone LHR-Chap, and whether this allosteric agonist can also restore the function of mutant LHRs with deficiencies in hormone binding or hormone-induced signalling. Methods: Mutant LHRs were expressed in HEK 293-T cells. Cell surface expression/localisation, hormone binding, and hCG/LHR-Chap signalling were determined by ELISA, radioligand binding, and inositol phosphate accumulation assays, respectively. Molecular modelling predicted LHR-Chap interactions. Results: LHR-Chap increased cell surface expression of a subset of retained mutants located in transmembrane helices predicted to be stabilised by LHR-Chap binding. For 3 (T461(3.47)I, L502(4.61)P, and S616(7.46)Y) hCG-responsiveness was increased following treatment. LHRs with mutations in the hormone-binding site (C131(ECD)R and I152(ECD)T) or in the hinge region (E354(Hinge)K) had good cell surface expression but poor response to hormone stimulation, yet were responsive to allosteric activation by LHR-Chap. Conclusions: LHR-Chap, in addition to rescuing cell surface expression of intracellularly retained LHR mutants, can rescue function in mutant receptors with binding and signalling deficiencies that have normal cell surface expression. This demonstration of rescue of multiple elements of LHR dysfunction arising from inactivating mutations offers exceptional potential for treating patients with diseases arising from GPCR mutations in general.

Previously reported PET imaging agents targeting CXCR4 suffer from either high nonspecific uptake or bind only to the human form of the receptor. The objective of this study was to develop a high-stability Cu-64-labeled small-molecule PET agent for imaging both human and murine CXCR4 chemokine receptors. Methods: Synthesis, radiochemistry, stability and radioligand binding assays were performed for the novel tracer Cu-64-CuCB-bicyclam. In vivo dynamic PET studies were performed on mice bearing U87 (CXCR4 low-expressing) and U87.CXCR4 (human-CXCR4 high-expressing) tumors. Biodistribution and receptor blocking studies were performed on CD1-IGS immunocompetent mice. CXCR4 expression on tumor and liver disaggregates was confirmed using a combination of immunohistochemistry, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and Western blot. Results: Cu-64-CuCB-bicyclam has a high affinity for both the human and the murine variants of the CXCR4 receptor (half-maximal inhibitory concentration, 8 nM [human]/2 nM [murine]) and can be obtained from the parent chelator that has low affinity. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate specific uptake in CXCR4-expressing cells that can be blocked by more than 90% using a higher-affinity antagonist, with limited uptake in non-CXCR4-expressing organs and high in vivo stability. The tracer was also able to selectively displace the CXCR4 antagonists AMD3100 and AMD3465 from the liver. Conclusion: The tetraazamacrocyclic small molecule Cu-64-CuCB-bicyclam has been shown to be an imaging agent for the CXCR4 receptor that is likely to be applicable across a range of species. It has high affinity and stability and is suitable for preclinical research in immunocompetent murine models.

Methods Eighty-two patients with phenotypic T2D were studied. Autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), insulinoma-associated protein-2 and zinc transporter 8 were measured by radioligand assay. Thirty-nine Ab(+) and 43 Ab(-) patients with phenotypic T2D were enrolled for T cell assay of responses to GAD65 and C-peptide antigen by ELISPOT. Results (1) Eleven of 43 Ab(-) participants with phenotypic T2D were demonstrated interferon (IFN)-gamma secreting T cells by ELISPOT, while 13 of 39 Ab(+) patients with phenotypic T2D were positive for T cells responses to islet antigens. (2) The onset ages of T cell(+) people with phenotypic T2D were younger than that of T cell(-) individuals (42.7 +/- 9.3 vs. 48.2 +/- 10.2 years, P = 0.025). Moreover, T cell(+) patients with T2D displayed a significantly lower fasting C-peptide (FCP) compared with T cell(-) participants [0.28 (0.02-0.84) vs. 0.42 (0.05-1.26) nmol/L, P = 0.013]. (3) Ab(-)T(+) group had a significantly lower FCP compared with Ab(-)T(-) group [0.31 (0.13-0.84) vs. 0.51 (0.07-1.26) nmol/L, P = 0.023]. Conclusions By measuring T cell responses to islet antigens in patients with phenotypic T2D, we identified a specific subtype of LADA who may be associated with worse basal beta-cell function than classic T2D (Ab(-)T(-)).

Role of the guanine nucleotide binding protein, Gα<sub>o,</sub> in the development of morphine tolerance and dependence	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Antinociception; Gprotein; Morphine; mu receptor; Receptor binding; Tolerance; Withdrawal	MU-OPIOID-RECEPTOR; PERIAQUEDUCTAL GRAY NEURONS; NEUROBLASTOMA SH-SY5Y CELLS; INBRED MOUSE STRAINS; RAT LOCUS-COERULEUS; KNOCK-OUT MICE; ANALGESIC TOLERANCE; PHYSICAL-DEPENDENCE; OPIATE WITHDRAWAL; LOCOMOTOR SENSITIZATION	The use of morphine and other opioids for chronic pain is limited by the development of analgesic tolerance and physical dependence. Morphine produces its effects by activating the mu opioid receptor, which couples to G alpha(i/o)-containing heterotrimeric G proteins. Evidence suggests that the antinociceptive effects of morphine are mediated by G alpha(o). However, the role of G alpha(o) in the development of morphine tolerance and dependence is unknown. The objective of the study is to evaluate the contribution of G alpha(o) to the development of morphine tolerance and dependence in mice. 129S6 mice lacking one copy of the G alpha(o) gene (G alpha(o) +/-) were administered morphine acutely or chronically. Mice were examined for tolerance to the antinociceptive action of morphine using the 52 A degrees C hot plate as the nociceptive stimulus and for dependence by evaluating the severity of naltrexone-precipitated withdrawal. Wild-type littermates of the G alpha(o) +/- mice were used as controls. Changes in mu receptor number and function were determined in midbrain and hindbrain homogenates using radioligand binding and mu agonist-stimulated [S-35]GTP gamma S binding, respectively. Following either acute or chronic morphine treatment, all mice developed antinociceptive tolerance and physical dependence, regardless of genotype. With chronic morphine treatment, G alpha(o) +/- mice developed tolerance faster and displayed more severe naltrexone-precipitated withdrawal in some behaviors than did wild-type littermates. Morphine tolerance was not associated with changes in mu receptor number or function in brain homogenates from either wild-type or G alpha(o) +/- mice. These data suggest that the guanine nucleotide binding protein G alpha(o) offers some protection against the development of morphine tolerance and dependence.

The primary aim of our case-control study was to explore neuroinflammation in patients with CRPS using positron emission tomography (PET), with an 18-kDa translocator protein specific radioligand [C-11]-(R)-PK11195. [C-11]-(R)-PK11195 PET scans were acquired for 11 patients with CRPS (30-55 years) and 12 control subjects (30-52 years). Parametric image of distribution volume ratio (DVR) for each participant was generated by applying a relative equilibrium-based graphical analysis. The DVR of [C-11]-(R)-PK11195 in the caudate nucleus (t((21))=-3.209, P=0.004), putamen (t((21))=-2.492, P=0.022), nucleus accumbens (t((21))=-2.218, P=0.040), and thalamus (t((21))=-2.395, P=0.026) were significantly higher in CRPS patients than in healthy controls. Those of globus pallidus (t((21))=-2.045, P=0.054) tended to be higher in CRPS patients than in healthy controls. In patients with CRPS, there was a positive correlation between the DVR of [C-11]-(R)-PK11195 in the caudate nucleus and the pain score, the visual analog scale (r=0.661, P=0.026, R-2=0.408) and affective subscales of McGill Pain Questionnaire (r=0.604, P=0.049, R-2=0.364). We demonstrated that neuroinflammation of CRPS patients in basal ganglia. Our results suggest that microglial pathology can be an important pathophysiology of CRPS. Association between the level of caudate nucleus and pain severity indicated that neuroinflammation in this region might play a key role. These results may be essential for developing effective medical treatments.

Scintillation proximity assay (SPA) as a new approach to determine a ligand's kinetic profile. A case in point for the adenosine A<sub>1</sub> receptor	PURINERGIC SIGNALLING			English	Article						G protein-coupled receptors; Scintillation proximity assay; Binding kinetics; Adenosine A(1) receptor; Residence time	BINDING-KINETICS; RESIDENCE TIME; A(2A) RECEPTOR; ANTAGONISTS; AGONIST; AFFINITY; POTENT; RADIOLIGAND; INHIBITION; MECHANISM	Scintillation proximity assay (SPA) is a radio-isotopic technology format used to measure a wide range of biological interactions, including drug-target binding affinity studies. The assay is homogeneous in nature, as it relies on a "mix and measure" format. It does not involve a filtration step to separate bound from free ligand as is the case in a traditional receptor-binding assay. For G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), it has been shown that optimal binding kinetics, next to a high affinity of a ligand, can result in more desirable pharmacological profiles. However, traditional techniques to assess kinetic parameters tend to be cumbersome and laborious. We thus aimed to evaluate whether SPA can be an alternative platform for real-time receptor-binding kinetic measurements on GPCRs. To do so, we first validated the SPA technology for equilibrium binding studies on a prototypic class A GPCR, the human adenosine A(1) receptor (hA(1)R). Differently to classic kinetic studies, the SPA technology allowed us to study binding kinetic processes almost real time, which is impossible in the filtration assay. To demonstrate the reliability of this technology for kinetic purposes, we performed the so-called competition association experiments. The association and dissociation rate constants (k (on) and k (off)) of unlabeled hA(1)R ligands were reliably and quickly determined and agreed very well with the same parameters from a traditional filtration assay performed simultaneously. In conclusion, SPA is a very promising technique to determine the kinetic profile of the drug-target interaction. Its robustness and potential for high-throughput may render this technology a preferred choice for further kinetic studies.

Relation of dopamine receptor 2 binding to pain perception in female fibromyalgia patients with and without depression - A [<SUP>11</SUP>C] raclopride PET-study	EUROPEAN NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						D2 receptors; Pain perception; Fibromyalgia; Depression; PET	HUMAN VENTRAL STRIATUM; D2 RECEPTORS; CLINICAL PAIN; LATERALIZATION; SYMPTOMS; CRITERIA	Dopamine D2/D3 receptor availability at rest and its association with individual pain perception was investigated using the [C-11] raclopride PET-method in 24 female Fibromyalgia (FMS) participants with (FMS+, N=11) and without (FMS-, N=13) comorbid depression and in 17 healthy women. Thermal pain thresholds (TPT) and pain responses were assessed outside the scanner. We compared the discriminative capacity, i.e. the individual's capacity to discriminate between lower and higher pain intensities and the response criterion, i.e. the subject's tendency to report pain during noxious stimulation due to psychological factors. [C-11] raclopride binding potential (BP), defined as the ratio of specifically bound non-displaceable radioligand at equilibrium (BPND) was used as measure of D2/D3 receptor availability. We found significant group effects of BPND in striatal regions (left ventral striatum, left caudate nucleus and left nucleus accumbens) between FMS+ and FMS compared to healthy subjects. Correlational analysis showed negative associations between TPT and D2/D3 receptor availability in the left caudate nucleus in FMS-, between TPT and D2/D3 receptor availability in the right caudate nucleus in FMS + and positive associations between TPT and D2/D3 receptor availability in the left putamen and right caudate nucleus in healthy controls. The response criterion was positively associated with D2/D3 receptor availability in the right nucleus accumbens in FMS - and negatively with D2/D3 receptor availability in the left caudate nucleus in healthy controls. Finally, no significant associations between D2/D3 receptor availability and discriminative capacity in any of the groups or regions were determined. These findings provide further support for a disruption of dopaminergic neurotransmission in FMS and implicate DA as important neurochemical moderator of differences in pain perception in FMS patients with and without co-morbid depression.

Binding of [F-18]FEH in rat brain cryostat sections indicated high affinity (K-D, = 3 nM), and density (B-max; 600 rho mol/g). The plasma free fraction was 45%, and untransformed parent constituted only 13% of plasma radioactivity at 10 min after injection. Compartmental analysis of PET recordings in pargyline-treated rats showed high permeability to brain (K-1; 0.32 mUg/min) and slow washout (k(2); 0.024/min), resulting in a uniformly high equilibrium distribution volume (V-D; 20 mUg). Using this V-D to estimate unbound ligand in brain of untreated rats, the binding potential ranged from 4.2 in cerebellum to 7.2 in thalamus. We also calculated maps of rats receiving [F-18]FEH at a range of specific activities, and then estimated saturation binding parameters in the living brain. In thalamus, striatum and frontal cortex Ki) was globally close to 300 nM and B-max was close to 1600 pmol/g; the 100-fold discrepancy in affinity suggests a very low free fraction for 118FTEH in the living brain. Based on a synthesis of findings, we calculate the endogenous dopamine concentration to be 0.4 mu M in the striatal compartment containing MAO-A, thus unlikely to exert competition against [F-18]FEH binding in vivo. In summary, [F-18]FEH has good properties for the detection of MAO-A in the rat brain by PET, and may present logistic advantages for clinical research at centers lacking a medical cyclotron.

Fos Expression in Response to Dopamine D3-Preferring Phenylpiperazine Drugs Given With and Without Cocaine	SYNAPSE			English	Article						c-fos; immediate early gene; striatum; nucleus accumbens	D-3 RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST; MESSENGER-RNA EXPRESSION; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; SEEKING BEHAVIOR; D3 RECEPTORS; SELECTIVE RADIOLIGAND; LOCOMOTOR-ACTIVITY; 5-HT1A ANTAGONIST; GENE-EXPRESSION; RAT-BRAIN	WC 44 and WC 10 are phenylpiperazines with low (23 fold) to moderate (42 fold) selectivity for dopamine D3 receptors (D3Rs) over D2Rs, respectively. WC 44 is a full D3R agonist in the forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase (AC) assay, whereas WC 10 has little efficacy. In contrast to their opposite effects in the AC assay, these drugs often produce similar behavioral effects, suggesting that the AC assay does not predict the efficacy of these drugs in vivo. Here, we examined whether Fos protein expression induced by these drugs would be more consistent with their behavioral effects in vivo. Rats received either vehicle, WC 10 (5.6 mg/kg, i.p.), WC 44 (10.0 mg/kg, i.p), cocaine (10.0 mg/kg, i.p.), or cocaine with WC 10 (5.6 mg/kg, i.p.) or with WC 44 (10.0 mg/kg, i.p). Locomotion was monitored for 90 min and the brains were harvested for immunohistochemistry. Both WC 10 and WC 44 decreased spontaneous and cocaine-induced locomotion. Both compounds also increased Fos expression relative to saline in the dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens core and shell, and relative to cocaine alone in the nucleus accumbens shell. The findings suggest that even though these compounds have different efficacy in the AC bioassy, they produce similar brain activation and attenuation of cocaine hyperlocomotion. Together with our previous research demonstrating that these compounds down-shift the cocaine self-administration dose-effect function, the findings support the idea that D3R-selective compounds may be useful for cocaine dependence medications development.

Relative contributions of peripheral versus supraspinal or spinal opioid receptors to the antinociception of systemic opioids	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Article							ROOT GANGLION NEURONS; INFLAMMATORY PAIN; P-GLYCOPROTEIN; SENSORY NEURONS; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; VISCERAL PAIN; DORSAL-HORN; RAT; MORPHINE; ANALGESIA	The contribution of supraspinal, spinal or peripheral mu-opioid receptors (MORs) to the overall antinociception of systemic centrally penetrating versus peripherally restricted opioids has not been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, we examined paw pressure thresholds in Wistar rats with complete Freund's adjuvant hindpaw inflammation following different doses of intraplantar (i.pl.) as well as intravenous (i.v.) fentanyl (6.25-50 mu g/kg), morphine (1-7.5 mg/kg) or loperamide (1-7.5 mg/kg). Antagonism of the i. v. mu-opioid agonists by intracerebroventricular (i. c. v.), intrathecal (i.t.) or i.pl. naloxone-methiodide (NLXM) revealed the relative contributions of supraspinal, spinal and peripheral MOR to the overall antinociceptive effects. In parallel, the MOR density at these three levels of pain transmission was assessed by radioligand binding. Antinociceptive effects of i. v. fentanyl and morphine, but not of the peripherally restricted loperamide were two-to threefold greater and longer lasting compared with their i.pl. administration. I. c. v. but not i. pl. NLXM significantly antagonized fentanyl's and morphine's antinociception by 70-80%, whereas i.t. NLXM reduced it by 20-30%. In contrast, antinociception of i. v. loperamide was abolished by i. pl. but not by i. c. v. or i.t. NLXM. In parallel, a respective 32- and sixfold higher MOR density in supraspinal and spinal versus peripheral sensory neurons was detected. In conclusion, in comparison with supraspinal and spinal opioid receptors, peripheral opioid receptors do not significantly contribute to the antinociception of systemic fentanyl and morphine during inflammatory pain. Antinociception of their i. v. administration was superior over both i. v and i. pl. loperamide, acting exclusively via peripheral MOR. These findings may guide the future development of novel peripherally restricted opioids.	[Khalefa, B. I.; Shaqura, M.; Mousa, S.

Inotropic Action of the Puberty Hormone Kisspeptin in Rat, Mouse and Human: Cardiovascular Distribution and Characteristics of the Kisspeptin Receptor	PLOS ONE			English	Article							METASTASIS SUPPRESSOR GENE; PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR; ORPHAN-RECEPTOR; UROTENSIN-II; KISS-1; GPR54; LOCALIZATION; PEPTIDE; CELLS; ACTIVATION	Kisspeptins, the ligands of the kisspeptin receptor known for its roles in reproduction and cancer, are also vasoconstrictor peptides in atherosclerosis-prone human aorta and coronary artery. The aim of this study was to further investigate the cardiovascular localisation and function of the kisspeptins and their receptor in human compared to rat and mouse heart. Immunohistochemistry and radioligand binding techniques were employed to investigate kisspeptin receptor localisation, density and pharmacological characteristics in cardiac tissues from all three species. Radioimmunoassay was used to detect kisspeptin peptide levels in human normal heart and to identify any pathological changes in myocardium from patients transplanted for cardiomyopathy or ischaemic heart disease. The cardiac function of kisspeptin receptor was studied in isolated human, rat and mouse paced atria, with a role for the receptor confirmed using mice with targeted disruption of Kiss1r. The data demonstrated that kisspeptin receptor-like immunoreactivity localised to endothelial and smooth muscle cells of intramyocardial blood vessels and to myocytes in human and rodent tissue. [I-125]KP-14 bound saturably, with subnanomolar affinity to human and rodent myocardium (K-D = 0.12 nM, human; K-D = 0.44 nM, rat). Positive inotropic effects of kisspeptin were observed in rat, human and mouse. No response was observed in mice with targeted disruption of Kiss1r. In human heart a decrease in cardiac kisspeptin level was detected in ischaemic heart disease. Kisspeptin and its receptor are expressed in the human, rat and mouse heart and kisspeptins possess potent positive inotropic activity. The cardiovascular actions of the kisspeptins may contribute to the role of these peptides in pregnancy but the consequences of receptor activation must be considered if kisspeptin receptor agonists are developed for use in the treatment of reproductive disorders or cancer.

Radiolabeled annexin A5 has been demonstrated to be a successful tool in the detection of apoptosis following chemotherapy in vivo. Methods: His-tagged annexin A5 was labeled with [Tc-99m]-tricarbonyl and evaluated as apoptosis imaging radiotracer in vitro and in vivo. The binding of the radiotracer was evaluated in Colo205 cells stimulated with 5-FU (1 mM) for 4 and 24 h, and confirmed by flow cytometry. Biodistribution and dosimetric studies were performed in healthy nude mice (n=5) via planar scintigraphy. [Tc-99m]-(CO)(3) His-annexin A5 was also evaluated for in vivo imaging of spontaneous apoptosis in Colo205-bearing mice (n=12). Results: The labeling procedure yielded a compound with 95-99% radiochemical purity and good in vitro stability. In vitro binding experiments indicated that the radiotracer retained its PS-binding activity. [Tc-99m]-(CO)(3) His-annexin AS rapidly cleared from the blood and predominantly accumulated in the kidneys. Absorbed dose (per organ) was found to be 116 64 mu Gy/MBq for the kidneys and 10.38 +/- 0.50 mu Gy/MBq for the liver. The effective dose was 7.00 +/- 0.28 mu Sv/MBq. Spontaneous apoptosis in Colo205-bearing mice was visualised by [Tc-99m]-(CO)(3) His-annexin AS SPECT and correlated well with caspase-3 immunostaining (R=0.867, P<.01). Conclusion: [Tc-99m]-(CO)(3) His-annexin AS may be a useful novel radioligand for the in vivo detection of cell death associated with PS expression. A simple; noninvasive way of detecting apoptosis in vivo could have many applications including a better understanding of the extent and timing of apoptosis in response to cancer therapies and assessment of early tumor response.

J	Schwarzer, S; Nobles, M; Tinker, A				Schwarzer, Sarah; Nobles, Muriel; Tinker, Andrew			Do Caveolae Have a Role in the Fidelity and Dynamics of Receptor Activation of G-protein-gated Inwardly Rectifying Potassium Channels?	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							HETEROTRIMERIC G-PROTEINS; RAT ATRIAL MYOCYTES; GIRK CHANNELS; K+-CHANNEL; MUSCARINIC RECEPTOR; DESENSITIZATION; IDENTIFICATION; EXPRESSION; MEMBRANE; AGONIST	In atrial and nodal cardiac myocytes, M2 muscarinic receptors activate inhibitory G-proteins (G(i/o)), which in turn stimulate G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ channels through direct binding of the G beta gamma subunit. Despite also releasing G beta gamma, G(s)-coupled receptors such as the beta-adrenergic receptor are not able to prominently activate this current. An appealing hypothesis would be if components were sequestered in membrane domains such as caveolae/rafts. Using biochemical fractionation followed by Western blotting and/or radioligand binding experiments, we examined the distribution of the components in stable HEK293 and HL-1 cells, which natively express the transduction cascade. The channel, M2 muscarinic, and A1 adenosine receptors were located in noncaveolar/nonraft fractions. G(i)alpha(1/2) was enriched in both caveolar/raft and noncaveolar/nonraft fractions. In contrast, G(s)alpha was only enriched in caveolar/raft fractions. We constructed YFP-tagged caveolin-2 (YFP-Cav2) and chimeras with the M2 (M2-YFP-Cav2) and A1 (A1-YFP-Cav2) receptors. Analysis of gradient fractions showed that these receptor chimeras were now localized to caveolae-enriched fractions. Microscopy showed that M2-YFP and A1-YFP had a diffuse homogenous membrane signal. YFP-Cav2, M2-YFP-Cav2, and A1-YFP-Cav2 revealed a more punctuate pattern. Finally, we looked at the consequences for signaling. Activation via M2-YFP-Cav2 or A1-YFP-Cav2 revealed substantially slower kinetics compared with M2-YFP or A1-YFP and was reversed by the addition of methyl-beta-cyclodextrin. Thus the localization of the channel signal transduction cascade in non-cholesterol rich domains substantially enhances the speed of signaling. The presence of G(s)alpha solely in caveolae may account for signaling selectivity between G(i/o) and G(s)-coupled receptors.

Methods: [F-18]MH.MZ, a 5-HT2A antagonistic receptor ligand, is labeled by F-18-fluoroalkylation of the corresponding desinethyl analogue MDL 105725 with 2-[F-18]fluoroethyltosylate ([F-18]FETos). In vitro binding experiments were performed to test selectivity toward a broad spectrum of neuroreceptors by radioligand binding assays. Moreover, first micro-positron emission tomography (p PET) experiments, ex vivo organ biodistribution, blood cell and protein binding and brain metabolism studies of [F-18]MH.MZ were carried out ill rats. Results: [F-18]MH.MZ showed a K-i of 3 nM toward the 5-HT2A receptor and no appreciable affinity for a variety of receptors and transporters. Ex vivo biodistribution as well as mu PET showed highest brain uptake at similar to 5 min p.i. and steady state after similar to 30 min p.i. While [F-18]MH.MZ undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism which significantly reduces its bioavailability, it is insignificantly metabolized within the: brain. The binding potential in the rat frontal cortex is 1.45, whereas the cortex to cerebellum ratio was determined to be 2.7 after similar to 30 min. Conclusion: Results from mu PET measurements of [F-18]MH.MZ are in no way interior to data known for [C-11]MDL 100907 at least in rats. [F-18]MH.MZ appears to be a highly potent and selective scrotonergic PET ligand in small animals. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The MC4R gene was sequenced in 2000 subjects with severe early-onset obesity. We detected seven different nonsense and 19 nonsynonymous mutations in a total of 94 probands, some of which have been reported previously by others. We functionally characterized the 11 novel obesity associated missense mutations. Seven of these mutants (L54P, E61K, I69T, S136P, M161T, T162I, and I269N) showed impaired cell surface trafficking, reduced level of maximal binding of the radioligand [I-125] NDP-MSH, and reduced ability to generate cAMP in response to ligand. Four mutant MC4Rs (G55V, G55D, S136F, and A303T) displayed cell surface expression and agonist binding similar to the wild-type receptor but showed impaired cAMP production, suggesting that these residues are likely to be critical for conformational rearrangement essential for receptor activation. Homology modeling of these mutants using a model of MC4R based on the crystal structure of the beta 2-adrenoreceptor was used to provide insights into the possible structural basis for receptor dysfunction. Transmembrane (TM) domains 1, 3, 6, 7, and peripheral helix 8 appear to participate in the agonist-induced conformational rearrangement necessary for coupling of ligand binding to signaling. We conclude that G55V, G55D, S136F, and A303T mutations are likely to strengthen helix-helix interactions between TM1 and TM2, TM3 and TM6, and TM7 and helix 8, respectively, preventing relative movement of these helices during receptor activation.

Serotonin transporters (SERT) have been implicated in the etiology of depression and drugs acting on SERT can be effective in treating depression. The aim of the present study was to study the in vivo effect of various antidepressants on [H-3] paroxetine binding to SERT in regions of rat brain. Rats were treated with tricyclic antidepressant (TCAs) such as amitriptyline (AMI), serotonin/ norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRIs) such as clomipramine (CMI), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine (FLX) and citalopram (CIT) (10 mg/kg body wt.) for 30 days. Density of SERT was measured in cortex and hippocampus using [H-3] paroxetine (0.03-1.0 nM) in presence and absence of 10 mu M fluoxetine as displacer. It was observed that the density of cortical SERT was significantly decreased with CMI (68%, P<0.0001), FLX (67%, P<0.0001), CIT (54%, P<0.0001), and AMI (52%, P<0.0001) treatment, when compared to the density of 120.7 +/- 4.0 fmol/mg protein in control rats, without altering the affinity (Kd) of [H-3] paroxetine to the transporters. The density of SERT in hippocampus was also significantly decreased with FLX (65%, P<0.0001), CMI (54%, P<0.0001), CIT (52%, P<0.0001) and AMI (46%, P<0.0001) treatment, when compared to the density of 74.0 +/- 2.6 fmol/mg protein in control rats, without altering the affinity of [H-3] paroxetine to the transporters. Displacement study showed high affinity for CMI[CIT[FLX. The results suggest that chronic antidepressant treatment significantly down-regulates both cortical and hippocampal SERT in rat brain and SSRIs have high affinity for SERT than TCAs.

On the basis of in-vitro studies, inhibition of the human serotonin transporter (5-HTT) is achieved by the S-enantiomer (S-citalopram or escitalopram). The aim of the present PET study was to compare 5-HTT occupancy after single equimolar doses (with respect to S-enantiomer) in humans in vivo using R,S-citalopram (20 mg) and S-citalopram (10 mg) using PET and the radioligand [(11)C]MADAM. The design was a single-dose, double-blind, two-way crossover study in eight healthy male subjects. The 5-HTT binding potential at baseline and after single doses of study drugs was used to calculate 5-HTT occupancy in seven brain regions. Serum concentrations of the study drugs were determined in order to calculate the apparent inhibition constant (K(i,app)), a secondary parameter of interest for the comparison. In all brain regions examined, occupancy was numerically higher after treatment with R,S-citalopram [66 +/- 19% to 78 +/- 17% (mean +/- S.D.) depending on the region] than after S-citalopram (59 +/- 15% to 69 +/- 13%; overall comparison: F=14.8, d.f.= 1, 90, p < 0.001). In line with this the apparent inhibition constant was significantly lower for R,S-citalopram than for S-citalopram (overall comparison: F=6.7, d.f. = 1, 90, p < 0.05). The small but significant difference in occupancy and K(i,app) found between R,S-citalopram and S-citalopram suggests that not only S-citalopram but also R-citalopram to some degree occupies the 5-HTT in the human brain in vivo.

Nicotinic modulation of gene expression in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						nicotine; neuroblastoma cells; SH-SY5Y cells; gene expression; microarray; nAChR; upregulation	ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR SUBTYPES; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; RAT-BRAIN; LINE; INHIBITION; MECHANISMS; SMOKING; NEURONS; GROWTH	Exposure to nicotine has a broad range of physiological and psychological effects that can be long lasting and contribute to nicotine dependence. On a time course longer than that needed to activate nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) function, nicotine exposure induces functional inactivation of nAChR, upregulation of nAChR radioligand binding sites, and other alterations of cellular functions. To identify possible mechanisms underlying nicotine-induced changes in nAChR numbers and function, we defined changes in gene expression in neuron-like, SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells following 24 h of continuous exposure to 1 mM nicotine. This treatment condition produces both functional inactivation and upregulation of nAChR. Repeat and cross-controlled microarray (similar to 5000 genes queried) analyses revealed 163 genes whose expression was consistently altered at the p < 0.01 level following nicotine treatment. Quantitative, real-time, reverse transcription -polymerase chain reaction analyses confirmed altered expression of thirteen out of fourteen of these genes chosen for further study, including contactin 1, myozenin 2, and ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes E2C and E2S. Inhibition or reversal of these effects by the general nAChR antagonist, D-tubocurarine, indicated that gene expression changes are dependent on nAChR activation. Studies using other nAChR subtype-selective antagonists identified gene expression changes that required activation of both alpha 7- and alpha 3*-nAChR, alpha 7-nAChR alone, or either alpha 7- or alpha 3 beta 4*-nAChR, suggesting some convergent and some divergent pathways of gene activation coupled to these nAChR subtypes. These results suggest that longer-term physiological and psychological effects of nicotine exposure and changes in nAChR expression may be due in part to effects on gene expression initiated by interactions with nAChR.

In this study, we examined the capacity of the model to track pharmacological changes in this biological process. We also investigated the potential loss of [C-11]HTP-derived radioactivity during a PET study, since loss should be negligible not to alter quantification. Six rhesus monkeys were investigated using bolus [C-11]HTP/PET methodology before and after pharmacological intervention. The second enzymatic step in serotonin synthesis was inhibited using the aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor NSD1015 (10 mg/kg). The extent of [C-11]-derived radioactivity loss from the brain was studied by inhibition of the enzyme responsible for formation of the tissue metabolite, monoamine oxidase A, using clorgyline (2 mg/kg). After NSD1015, the uptake of [C-11]HTP-derived radioactivity was increased in all the investigated brain regions, while the parameter used to reflect decarboxylase activity, the net accumulation rate constant (K-acc), was decreased by 37% in the striatum, compared with baseline. Pretreatment with clorgyline did not change the brain uptake of [C-11]HTP-derived radioactivity or K-acc. This study demonstrates that the 2TCM for [C-11]HTP/PET is able to detect changes occurring during alteration of the biological process (i.e., the conversion of HTP to serotonin). Elimination of the radiotracer metabolite [C-11]HIAA from the brain may be considered negligible if the PET study is limited to 60 min.

In the current study, the existence of heterogeneous receptor populations for G17-Gly on the HT-29 human colon cancer cell line was investigated. The effect of either N- or C-terminal peptide truncation on receptor binding and cell growth stimulation was also explored. [Leu(15)]G17-Gly bound to both high (nM) and low (mu M) affinity sites on HT-29 cells. The peptide stimulated cell growth in a dose-dependent and biphasic manner with maximal stimulation at 10(-9) M peptide concentration, suggesting that, as in the case of DLD-1 cells, it is the high affinity receptor which is responsible for the growth-promoting effects. In contrast, G17(1-12) stimulated the growth of HT-29 cells in a sigmoidal fashion with an EC50 of 4.6 x 10(-9) M. Sequential N-terminal truncation of [Leu(15)]G17-Gly results in decreased binding to the high affinity G17-Gly receptor on DLD-1 cells. [Leu(15)]G17(11-17)Gly bound to the low affinity G17-Gly receptor with an affinity similar to that of the full sequence peptide but was unable to displace the radioligand from high affinity sites. G17(1-6)-NH2 was unable to displace [H-3]G17-Gly from either site. These results suggest that the important residues for binding to the low affinity receptor are in the C-terminal region of the peptide while those required for interaction with the high affinity receptor lie further towards the N-terminus.

Materials and Methods: In rats receiving oral and intravesical oxybutynin we measured muscarinic receptors in the bladder and other tissues by radioligand binding assay using [H-3]NMS ([N-methyl-H-3]scopolamine methyl chloride) with the simultaneous measurement of plasma concentrations of oxybutynin and its active metabolite N-desethyl-oxybutynin. Pilocarpine induced salivary secretion was also measured. Results: Following oral administration of oxybutynin there was a significant increase in the apparent dissociation constant (K-d) for specific [H-3]NMS binding in the bladder, submaxillary gland, heart and colon of rats at 1 and 3 hours with a consistent decrease in the maximal number of binding sites (B-max) in the submaxillary gland. Furthermore, a marked and prolonged decrease in pilocarpine induced salivary secretion in rats was observed by oral oxybutynin. In contrast, intravesical instillation of oxybutynin produced a significant increase in K-d for specific [H-3]NMS binding in the bladder of rats at 0.5 to 4 hours later and also in the submaxillary gland only at 0.5 hours later. The enhancement in K-d was much larger and longer lasting in the bladder than in the submaxillary gland. Moreover, intravesical oxybutynin had little muscarinic receptor binding activity in the heart and colon, and little significant suppression of pilocarpine induced salivation in rats. The plasma concentrations of oxybutynin and N-desethyl-oxybutynin were much higher in rats receiving oxybutynin orally than intravesically. Conclusions: Intravesical oxybutynin in rats may cause selective binding of bladder muscarinic receptors via a direct local effect, while oral oxybutynin may exert predominant binding of salivary gland receptors.

Indeed, this radioligand labels two subtypes of NK1 binding sites (which present a high affinity not only for SP but also for neurokinin A, neuropeptide K and neuropeptide gamma) as well as NK3 binding sites. The distribution of NK2 binding sites was also compared with those of NK1 and NK3 binding sites, these sites being labeled with [I-125]Bolton and Hunter substance P and [I-125]Bolton and Hunter eledoisin, respectively. In agreement with our results obtained with membranes from various brain structures, NK2-sensitive [I-125]neurokinin A labeling was mainly observed in few structures including the dorsal and ventral hippocampus, the septum, the thalamus and the prefrontal cortex. The density of NK2 binding sites was weak when compared with those of NK1 and NK3 binding sites. Marked differences were observed in the distributions of NK1, NK2 and NK3 binding sites. These results are discussed taking into consideration differences or similarities between the distributions of NK2-sensitive [I-125]neurokinin A binding sites and of their endogenous ligands (neurokinin A, neuropeptide K and neuropeptide gamma) but also local NK2 agonist responses blocked by NK2 antagonists. Insights on the roles of endogenous tachykinins in several brain functions are also discussed on the basis of the respective distributions of different neurokinin binding sites. (C) 2003 IBRO.

However, previous studies indicate that CTAP may possess unusual pharmacology under certain conditions. Therefore, CTAP was evaluated as an antagonist of the antinociceptive effects of a range of structurally diverse high- and low-efficacy peptide and alkaloid opioid agonists and compared with the traditional antagonist naltrexone. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (N = 227) were loosely restrained and the latency for tail withdrawal from 55degreesC water was measured. Morphine s.c. and i.c.v., buprenorphine s.c., etorphine s.c. and i.c.v., [N-Me-Phe(3),D-Pro(4)]-morphiceptin and [D-Ala(2),N-Me-Phe(4),Gly(5)ol]-enkephalin produced antinociceptive effects. CTAP was at least 10-fold more potent than naltrexone as an antagonist of the antinociceptive effects of all five agonists. High doses of CTAP produced a noncompetitive antagonism of etorphine s.c. and morphine s.c. suggesting that CTAP may interact with additional opioid receptors in vivo or produce insurmountable antagonism at these doses. CTAP was approximately 300-fold more potent as an antagonist of DAMGO than the other agonists, indicating that CTAP may distinguish some peptide agonists such as DAMGO from other agonists based on binding interactions within the mu-opioid receptor or pharmacodynamic properties of these peptides. Naltrexone, however, administered by either s.c. or i.c.v. routes of administration was approximately equipotent as an antagonist of the antinociceptive effects of most agonists. Taken together, these data indicate that the peptide antagonist CTAP possesses a unique pharmacology unlike traditional opioid antagonists such as naltrexone.

It is still not clear whether the drug has a direct and specific effect on neurotransmission or its effects are due to extracerebral actions, such as changes in cerebral blood flow. The main objective of the present investigation was to determine the global uptake and regional distribution of radiolabelled vinpocetine in the human brain in order to explore whether it may have direct central nervous system effects. Material and methods - Three healthy subjects were examined with positron emission tomography and [(11)C] vinpocetine. The regional uptake was determined in anatomically defined volumes-of-interest. The fractions of [(11)C] vinpocetine and labelled metabolites in plasma were determined using high pressure liquid chromatography. Results - The uptake of [(11)C] vinpocetine in brain was rapid and 3.7% (mean; n = 4) of the total radioactivity injected was in brain 2 min after radioligand administration. The uptake was heterogeneously distributed among brain regions. When compared with the cerebellum, an a priori reference region, the highest regional uptake was in the thalamus, upper brain stem, striatum and cortex. Following an initial peak, the total concentration of radioactivity in blood was relatively stable with time, whereas the concentration of the unchanged compound decreased with time in an exponential manner. Conclusion Vinpocetine, administered intravenously in humans, readily passes the blood - brain barrier and enters the brain. Its regional uptake and distribution in the brain is heterogeneous, indicating binding to specific sites. The brain regions showing increased uptake in the human brain correspond to those in which vinpocetine has been shown to induce elevated metabolism and blood flow. These observations support the hypothesis that vinpocetine has direct neuronal actions in the human brain.

Here we present a novel interaction between TNFR subtypes and TNF-alpha in the brain. Our studies on target-depleted TNFR in mice show that TNF-alpha has little effect on hippocampal neurons in which TNFRI, containing an "intracellular death domain," is absent (TNFRI -/-), whereas neurons from TNFRII knock-out mice are vulnerable to TNF-alpha even at low doses. Moreover, little nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) translocation is induced by TNF-alpha in neurons of TNFRI -/-, whereas NF-kappaB subunit p65 is still translocated from the cytoplasm into the nucleus in neurons from wild-type and TNFRII -/- mice. Furthermore, p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activity is upregulated in neurons from both wild-type and TNFRI -/-, but no alteration of p38 MAP kinase was found in neurons from TNFRII. Results from overexpression of TNF receptors further support the above findings. NT2 neuronal-like cells transiently transfected with TNFRI are very sensitive to TNF-alpha, whereas TNF-alpha is not toxic and even seems to be trophic to the cells with TNFRII overexpression. Last, our radioligand-binding experiments demonstrate that TNF-alpha binds TNFRI with high affinity (K-d of 0.6 nM), whereas TNFRII shows lower binding affinity (K-d of 1.14 nM) to TNF-alpha in NT2 transfected cells. Together, these studies reveal novel neuronal responses of TNF-alpha in mediating consequences of TNF receptor activation differently. Subsequent neuronal death or survival may ultimately depend on a particular subtype of TNF receptor that is predominately expressed in neurons of the brain during neural development or with neurological diseases.

METHODS: Twenty-three postmenopausal women with climacteric symptoms completed this double-blind, randomized, crossover study. The women received 2 mg of estradiol continuously during four 28-day cycles. In the last 14 days of each cycle, 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate, I mg of norethindrone acetate, or placebo was given. Before treatment, as well as once during the last week of each treatment, blood samples were collected for analysis of [H-3]LSD and [H-3]paroxetine binding. The power of the study setup was 81%. The study had an effect size of 0.36, corresponding to the ability to detect a 15% difference in [H-3]paroxetine and [H-3]LSD binding between treatments with alpha = .05 and beta = .20, based on a previously reported standard deviation within cells of 20% of the mean binding values. RESULTS: The number of platelet receptors (B-max), or the affinity of the radioligand to the receptor (K-d), for [H-3]paroxetine binding did not change during estrogen or estrogen-progestogen treatment, nor did B-max or K-d for [H-3]LSD binding change during the different treatments. However, in a subgroup of depressed patients, the decrease in B-max for [H-3]LSD binding during treatment was significantly more pronounced than in the nondepressed subgroup (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Estrogen treatment with or without the addition of progestogen does not affect binding to the serotonin transporter or to die serotonergic 5-HT2A receptor in healthy postmenopausal women.

In this study, we characterized the kinetics, pharmacology, and distribution of [H-3]LY341495 binding to mGlu receptors in rat brain tissue. Equilibrium experiments in the rat forebrain demonstrated binding to a single site that was saturable, reversible, and of high affinity (B-max, 3.9 +/-0.65 pmol/mg of protein, K-d, 0.84 +/-0.11 nM). The relative order of potencies for displacement of [H-3]LY341495 by mGlu receptor ligands was LY341495 much greater than L-glutamic acid > LY354740 > (2S,1'S,2'S)-2-(carboxycyclopropyl)glycine > 4-(2R,4R)-aminopyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylate > (1S,3R)-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid > (R,S)-alpha -methyl-4-phosphonophenylglycine > (R,S)3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine > L-(+)-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid. [H-3]LY341495 was not displaced by the selective ionotropic glutamate receptor agonists N-methyl-D-aspartic acid, (R,S)-a alpha -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid, or kainate at concentrations up to 1 mM. Comparison of [H-3]LY341495 binding in rat brain with recombinant mGlu receptor subtypes demonstrated a very high correlation with mGlu3 receptor binding (r(2) = 0.957), a significant, but lower, correlation with mGlu2 receptor binding (r(2) = 0.869), but no significant correlation to mGlu8 receptor binding ((r2) = 0.284). Regional studies using autoradiography showed a similar distribution of [H-3]LY341495 binding to that for group II mGlu receptors previously reported by others using immunocytochemical techniques. These studies indicate that [H-3]LY341495 selectively labels group II (mGlu2/3) receptors, but under the conditions used, [H-3]LY341495 may bind predominately to mGlu3 receptor populations in the rat forebrain.

In the present study, we examined the relationship between drug-induced 5-HT release and long-term 5-HT depletion in rat brain. The 5-HT-releasing actions of d-fenfluramine and a non-amphetamine 5-HT drug, 1-(m-chlorophenyl)piperazine (mCPP), were compared using in vivo microdialysis in the nucleus accumbens. The ability of d-fenfluramine and mCPP to interact with 5-HT transporters was tested using in vitro assays for T [H-3]5-HT uptake and radioligand binding. Local infusion of d-fenfluramine or mCPP (1-100 muM) increased extracellular 5-HT, with elevations in dopamine occurring at high doses. Intravenous injection of either drug (1-10 mu mol/kg) produced dose-related increases in 5-HT without affecting dopamine. d-Fenfluramine and mCPP exhibited similar potency in their ability to stimulate 5-HT efflux in vivo and interact with 5-HT transporters in vitro. When rats received high-dose d-fenfluramine or mCPP (10 or 30 mu mol/kg, i.p., every 2 h, 4 doses), only d-fenfluramine-treated rats displayed long-term 5-HT depletions. Thus, mCPP is a 5-HT releaser that does not appear to cause 5-HT depletion. Our data support the notion that 5-HT release per se may not be sufficient to produce the long-term 5-HT deficits associated with d-fenfluramine and other amphetamines.

Catecholamines within select brain stem nuclei are implicated in the control of autonomic and respiratory function, including in the nucleus of the solitary tract and the dorsal motor nucleus of X. Animal and adult human studies have shown high binding to alpha (2)-adrenergic receptors in these regions. To determine the developmental profile of brainstem alpha (2)-adrenergic binding across early human life, we studied brain stems from five fetuses at midgestation, three newborns (37-38 postconceptional weeks), and six infants (44-61 postconceptional weeks). We used quantitative tissue receptor autoradiography with [H-3]para-aminoclonidine as the radioligand and phentolamine as the displacer. In the fetal group, binding was high (63-93 fmol/mg tissue) in the nucleus of the solitary tract. dorsal motor nucleus of X, locus coeruleus, and reticular formation, it was low (< 32 fmol/mg tissue) in the principal inferior olive and basis pontis. Binding decreased in all regions with age: in infancy, the highest binding was in the intermediate range (32-62 fmol/mg tissue) and was localized to the nucleus of the solitary tract and dorsal motor nucleus of X. The most substantial decrease in binding (75%-85%) between the fetal and infant periods occurred in the pontine and medullary reticular formation and hypoglossal nucleus. Binding remained lour in the principal inferior olive and basis pontis. The decreases in binding with age remained significant after quench correction. These data suggest that rapid and dramatic changes occur in early human life in the brain stem catecholaminergic system in regions related to cardiorespiratory control.

The deuterium substitution of both of the 2'-hydrogens of altanserin ([F-18]deuteroaltanserin) yields a metabolically more stable radiotracer with higher ratios of parent tracer to radiometabolites and increased specific brain uptake than [F-18]altanserin. The slower metabolism of the deuterated analog might preclude the possibility of achieving stable plasma and brain activities with a bolus plus constant infusion within a reasonable time frame for an F-18-labeled tracer (T-1/2 110 min). Thus, the purpose of this study was to test the feasibility in human subjects of a constant infusion paradigm for equilibrium modeling of [F-18]deuteroaltanserin with PET. Seven healthy male subjects were injected with [F-18]deuteroaltanserin as a bolus plus constant infusion lasting 10 h postinjection. PET acquisitions and venous blood sampling were performed throughout the infusion period. Linear regression analysis revealed that time-activity curves for both specific brain uptake and plasma [F-18]deuteroaltanserin concentration stabilized after about 5 h, This permitted equilibrium modeling and estimation of V-3' (ratio of specific uptake to total plasma parent concentration) and the binding potential V-3 (ratio of specific uptake to free plasma parent concentration), Cortical/cerebellar ratios were increased by 26% relative to those we previously observed with [F-18]altanserin using similar methodology in a somewhat older subject sample. These results demonstrate feasibility of equilibrium imaging with [F-18]deuteroaltanserin and suggest that it may be superior to [F-18]altanserin as a PET radioligand.

Series of N-phenyl-N'-quinazolin-4-ylurea derivatives and N-phenyl-N'-isoquinolin-1-ylurea derivatives were synthesized and tested in radioligand binding assays on their adenosine receptor affinities. A structure-affinity analysis indicated that on the 2-position of the quinazoline ring or the equivalent 3-position of the isoquinoline ring a phenyl or heteroaryl substituent increased the adenosine A(3) receptor affinity in comparison to unsubstituted or aliphatic derivatives. Furthermore, the structure-affinity relationship of substituted phenylurea analogues was investigated. Substituents such as electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups were introduced at different positions of the benzene ring to probe electronic and positional effects of substitution. Substitution on the 3- or 4-position of the phenyl ring decreased the adenosine A(3) receptor affinity. Substitution at position 2 with an electron-donating substituent, such as methyl qr methoxy, increased human adenosine A(3) receptor affinity, whereas substitution on the 2-position with an electron withdrawing -substituent did not influence affinity. Combination of the optimal substituents in the two series had an additive effect; which led to the potent human adenosine A(3) receptor antagonist N-(2-methoxyphenyl)-N'-(2-(3-pyridyl)quinazolin-4-yl)urea (VUF5574, 10a) showing a K-i value of 4 nM and being at least 2500-fold selective vs A(1) and A(2A) receptors. Compound 10a competitively antagonized the effect of an agonist in a functional A3 receptor assay, i.e., inhibition of cAMP production in cells expressing the human adenosine A3 receptor; a pA(2) value of 8.1 was derived from a Schild plot. In conclusion, compound 10a is a potent and selective human adenosine A(3) receptor antagonist and might be a useful tool in further characterization of the human A(3) receptor.

Linking resting-state network fluctuations with systems of coherent synaptic density: A multimodal fMRI and <SUP>11</SUP>C-UCB-J PET study	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						PET; resting-state network (RSN); fMRI; multimodal neuroimaging; C-11-UCB-J; SV2A; ICA	GLUCOSE-METABOLISM; INTRINSIC CONNECTIVITY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; DEFAULT-MODE; BRAIN; PROTEIN; EXPRESSION; AMPLITUDE	Introduction: Resting-state network (RSN) connectivity is a widely used measure of the brain's functional organization in health and disease; however, little is known regarding the underlying neurophysiology of RSNs. The aim of the current study was to investigate associations between RSN connectivity and synaptic density assessed using the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A radioligand C-11-UCB-J PET.Methods: Independent component analyses (ICA) were performed on resting-state fMRI and PET data from 34 healthy adult participants (16F, mean age: 46 +/- 15 years) to identify a priori RSNs of interest (default-mode, right frontoparietal executive-control, salience, and sensorimotor networks) and select sources of C-11-UCB-J variability (medial prefrontal, striatal, and medial parietal). Pairwise correlations were performed to examine potential intermodal associations between the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) of RSNs and subject loadings of C-11-UCB-J source networks both locally and along known anatomical and functional pathways.Results: Greater medial prefrontal synaptic density was associated with greater fALFF of the anterior default-mode, posterior default-mode, and executive-control networks. Greater striatal synaptic density was associated with greater fALFF of the anterior default-mode and salience networks. Post-hoc mediation analyses exploring relationships between aging, synaptic density, and RSN activity revealed a significant indirect effect of greater age on fALFF of the anterior default-mode network mediated by the medial prefrontal C-11-UCB-J source.Discussion: RSN functional connectivity may be linked to synaptic architecture through multiple local and circuit-based associations. Findings regarding healthy aging, lower prefrontal synaptic density, and lower default-mode activity provide initial evidence of a neurophysiological link between RSN activity and local synaptic density, which may have relevance in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders.

Michael			A rapid and systematic approach for the optimization of radio thin-layer chromatography resolution	JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A			English	Article						Radiochemistry; radiopharmaceuticals; radio-TLC; high-resolution; PRISMA optimization	PET TRACER; METABOLISM; RECEPTOR; RADIOLIGAND; RADIOTRACER; QUANTIFICATION; RADIOSYNTHESIS; RETENTION; DIAGNOSIS; THERAPY	Radiopharmaceutical analysis is limited by conventional methods. Radio-HPLC may be inaccurate for some compounds (e.g., 18F-radiopharmaceuticals) due to radionuclide sequester. Radio-TLC is simpler, faster, and detects all species but has limited resolution. Imaging-based readout of TLC plates (e.g., using Cerenkov luminescence imaging) can improve readout resolution, but the underlying chromato-graphic separation efficiency may be insufficient to resolve chemically similar species such as product and precursor-derived impurities. This study applies a systematic mobile phase optimization method, PRISMA, to improve radio-TLC resolution. The PRISMA method optimizes the mobile phase by selecting the correct solvent, optimizing solvent polarity, and optimizing composition. Without prior knowledge of impurities and by simply observing the separation resolution between a radiopharmaceutical and its nearest radioactive or non-radioactive impurities (observed via UV imaging) for different mobile phases, the PRISMA method enabled the development of high-resolution separation conditions for a wide range of 18F-radiopharmaceuticals ( [18F]PBR-06, [18F]FEPPA, [18F]Fallypride, [18F]FPEB, and [18F]FDOPA). Each op-timization required a single batch of crude radiopharmaceutical and a few hours. Interestingly, the opti-mized TLC method provided greater accuracy (compared to other published TLC methods) in determining the product abundance of one radiopharmaceutical studied in more depth ( [18F]Fallypride) and was capa-ble of resolving a comparable number of species as isocratic radio-HPLC. We used the PRISMA-optimized mobile phase for [18F]FPEB in combination with multi-lane radio-TLC techniques to evaluate reaction per-formance during high-throughput synthesis optimization of [18F]FPEB. The PRISMA methodology, in com-bination with high-resolution radio-TLC readout, enables a rapid and systematic approach to achieving high-resolution and accurate analysis of radiopharmaceuticals without the need for radio-HPLC.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V.

M.; Belloli, Sara			Development of a new toolbox for mouse PET-CT brain image analysis fully based on CT images and validation in a PD mouse model	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							PARKINSONS-DISEASE; MICROGLIAL ACTIVATION	Automatic analysis toolboxes are popular in brain image analysis, both in clinical and in preclinical practices. In this regard, we proposed a new toolbox for mouse PET-CT brain image analysis including a new Statistical Parametric Mapping-based template and a pipeline for image registration of PET-CT images based on CT images. The new templates is compatible with the common coordinate framework (CCFv3) of the Allen Reference Atlas (ARA) while the CT based registration step allows to facilitate the analysis of mouse PET-CT brain images. From the ARA template, we identified 27 volumes of interest that are relevant for in vivo imaging studies and provided binary atlas to describe them. We acquired 20 C57BL/6 mice with [F-18]FDG PET-CT, and 12 of them underwent 3D T2-weighted high-resolution MR scans. All images were elastically registered to the ARA atlas and then averaged. High-resolution MR images were used to validate a CT-based registration pipeline. The resulting method was applied to a mouse model of Parkinson's disease subjected to a test-retest study (n = 6) with the TSPO-specific radioligand [F-18]VC701. The identification of regions of microglia/macrophage activation was performed in comparison to the Ma and Mirrione template. The new toolbox identified 11 (6 after false discovery rate adjustment, FDR) brain sub-areas of significant [F-18]VC701 uptake increase versus the 4 (3 after FDR) macro-regions identified by the Ma and Mirrione template. Moreover, these 11 areas are functionally connected as found by applying the Mouse Connectivity tool of ARA. In conclusion, we developed a mouse brain atlas tool optimized for PET-CT imaging analysis that does not require MR. This tool conforms to the CCFv3 of ARA and could be applied to the analysis of mouse brain disease models.	[Presotto, L.; Bettinardi, V; Picchio, M.; Moresco, R.

The purpose of this study was to assess the rate of striatal DAT loss in healthy Taiwanese adults using kit-based Tc-99m-TRODAT-1, a radioligand for DAT SPECT. Patients and Methods: Fifty healthy subjects (mean age SD, 63 12 years; range, 30-80 years) were studied. Tc-99m-TRODAT-1 was prepared from a lyophilized kit. Brain DAT SPECT imaging was acquired between 165 and 195 minutes postinjection (similar to 740 MBq or 20 mCi) using a dual-head camera equipped with fan-beam collimators (Helix SPX; GE). Specific uptake in the striatum (ST), caudate nucleus (CA), and putamen (PU) were calculated from reconstructed transaxial slices at the level of maximal striatal activity. Occipital cortices were used as reference areas. Data were presented as specific binding ratios. Results: Age had a significant moderate to large negative effect on striatal DAT, which declined by -25.7% +/- 6.10% between the ages of 30 and 80 years, equivalent to 6.4% loss per decade. The rates of decline in the CA and PU were 6.9% and 7.3% per decade, respectively. Conclusions: This study suggests ethnic variations may not significantly affect the age-related decline in DAT. The data generated in this study could also be used as a reference to estimate DAT loss/occupancy in patients with DAT-related diseases.

Cultured astrocytes expressed histamine H-1 and H-3 receptors (H(1)Rs and H(3)Rs) as evaluated by radioligand binding. Receptor functionality was confirmed by the increase in the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ (H1R) and the inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation (H3R). Quantitative RT-PCR showed that histamine and selective H1R and H3R agonists (1 h incubation) significantly increased GLUT-1 mRNA to 153 +/- 7, 163 +/- 2 and 168 +/- 13% of control values, respectively. In immunoblot assays, incubation (3 h) with histamine or H1R and H3R agonists increased GLUT-1 protein levels to 224 +/- 12, 305 +/- 11 and 193 +/- 13% of control values, respectively, an action confirmed by inmunocytochemistry. The effects of H1R and H3R agonists were blocked by the selective antagonists mepyramine (H1R) and clobenpropit (H3R). The pharmacological inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) prevented the increase in GLUT-1 protein induced by either H1R or H3R activation. Furthermore, histamine increased ERK-1/2 phosphorylation, and the effect of H1R and H3R activation on GLUT-1 protein levels was reduced or prevented, respectively, by MEK-1/2 inhibition. These results indicate that by activating H(1)Rs and H 3 Rs histamine regulates the expression of GLUT-1 by astrocytes. The effect appears to involve the phospholipase C (PLC) -> diacylglycerol (DAG)/Ca2+ -> PKC and PLC -> DAG/Ca2+-> PKC -> MAPK pathways.

Twenty-four (17 women, 7 men; mean age: 58.9 +/- 12.7) multiple myeloma patients who had undergone 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging to evaluate the disease activity were included in the study. 68Ga-Pentixafor PET/CT imaging was performed within an average period of 12 days after initial 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging. 68Ga-Pentixafor PET and 18F-FDG PET/CT revealed focal pathological lesions in 13/24 (54%) and 16/24 (67%) patients, respectively. In 19/24 patients, both tracers showed concordant findings (CXCR4+ and FDG+ in 12 patients; CXCR4- and FDG- in 7patients). In the remaining 5 patients, findings were discordant. The number of focal lesions identified by means of 68Ga-Pentixafor and 18-FFDG were 89 (44%) and 113 (56%), respectively. 68Ga-Pentixafor PET/CT showed more lesions in 2/12 (17%) patients, whereas 18F-FDG PET/CT was proved to be superior in 7/12 (58%) patients. In the remaining 3/12 (25%) patients, both tracers detected an equal number of lesions. There was no significant difference in appendicular and axial skeletal and extramedullary distribution ratios for both PET/CT examinations (p> 0.05). There was no statistically significant correlations between the 68Ga-Pentixafor PET/CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT positivity and disease activity, MM subtype, ISS phase, light chain disease, beta2microglobulin, albumin, creatinine, LDH, FLC and M protein levels in during scans. 68Ga-Pentixafor PET/CT cannot replace 18F-FDG PET/CT for diagnostic imaging of patients with multiple myeloma, 68Ga-PET/CT seem to be a valuable probe for patient stratification in the context of CXCR4-targeted radioligand therapy.

[H-3]NMS dissociation binding experiments revealed an allosteric retardation of dissociation at 100 mu M of MB ranging from none in hM(3) to 4.6-fold in hM(2) receptors. Accordingly, global non-linear regression analysis of equilibrium inhibition binding curves between [H-3]NMS (0.2 and 2.0 nM) and MB was applied and compared using either an allosteric or a competitive model. The allosteric cooperativity of MB binding within MB/NMS/hM receptor complexes was strongly negative and undistinguishable from a competitive interaction throughout all subtypes. Applying the competitive model to the equilibrium binding data of MB and NMS, suggested competition at all hM subtypes: logK(I) (+/- S.E.) hM(3) = 8.71 +/- 0.15, hM(1) = 8.68 +/- 0.14, hM(5) = 8.58 +/- 0.07, hM(2) = 8.27 +/- 0.07 to hM(4) = 8.25 +/- 0.11. Secondly, the effects of MB on acetylcholine (ACh) induced hM receptor function showed very strong negative allosteric cooperativity at all subtypes pointing against an allosteric antagonism of MB with ACh. Competition with ACh was characterized by logK(B): hM(1) = 9.53 +/- 0.05, hM(4) = 9.33 +/- 0.05, hM(5) = 8.80 +/- 0.05, hM(2) = 8,79 +/- 0.06, to hM(3) = 8.43 +/- 0.04. In conclusion, MB, below 1 mu M, binds competitively and non-selectively (except for the difference between hM(3) vs. hM(4)) to all five hM receptor subtypes with nanomolar affinity and is able to functionally inhibit ACh responses in a competitive fashion, with a slight subtype preference for hM(1) and hM(4).

Label-free versus conventional cellular assays: Functional investigations on the human histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptor	PHARMACOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Histamine H-1 receptor; Impedimetry; Dynamic mass redistribution; Calcium assay; beta-Arrestin recruitment; Reporter gene assay	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; BETA-GAMMA-SUBUNIT; SELECTIVITY; ACTIVATION; AGONIST; KINASE; CELLS; EXPRESSION; BIOSENSOR; IMPEDANCE	A set of histamine H-1 receptor (H-1 R) agonists and antagonists was characterized in functional assays, using dynamic mass redistribution (DMR), electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) and various signaling pathway specific readouts (Fura-2 and aequorin calcium assays, arrestin recruitment (luciferase fragment complementation) assay, luciferase gene reporter assay). Data were gained from genetically engineered HEK293T cells and compared with reference data from GTPase assays and radioligand binding. Histamine and the other H-1 R agonists gave different assay-related pEC(50) values, however, the order of potency was maintained. In the luciferase fragment complementation assay, the H1R preferred beta-arrestin2 over beta-arrestin1. The calcium and the impedimetric assay depended on G(q) coupling of the H1R, as demonstrated by complete inhibition of the histamine-induced signals in the presence of the Gq inhibitor FR900359 (UBO-QIC). Whereas partial inhibition by FR900359 was observed in DMR and the gene reporter assay, pertussis toxin substantially decreased the response in DMR, but increased the luciferase signal, reflecting the contribution of both, Gq and Gi, to signaling in these assays. For antagonists, the results from DMR were essentially compatible with those from conventional readouts, whereas the impedance-based data revealed a trend towards higher pK(b) values. ECIS and calcium assays apparently only reflect Gq signaling, whereas DMR and gene reporter assays appear to integrate both, G(q) and G(i) mediated signaling. The results confirm the value of the label-free methods, DMR and ECIS, for the characterization of H1R ligands. Both noninvasive techniques are complementary to each other, but cannot fully replace reductionist signaling pathway focused assays. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Bischalcone derivative, 5,8-bis(carboxymethyl)-13-(4-((E)-3-(4-(dimethylamino)phenyl) acryloyl)phenoxy)-2-(2-(2-(4-(( E)-3-(4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)acryloyl)phenoxy)ethylamino)-2-oxoethyl)-10-oxo-2,5,8,11-tetra-azatridecane-1-carboxylic acid, DT(Ch)(2) was synthesized in 95% yield with high purity. It was radiolabelled with Ga-68 under mild conditions with 85.4% efficiency and 9.5-10 MBq nmol(-1) specific activity. An in vitro binding assay on A beta 42 aggregates displayed high binding affinity of Ga-68-DT(Ch)(2) and inhibition constant of 4.18 +/- 0.62 nM. The fluorescent properties of the ligand with peaks of absorption/emission at 410/540 nm exhibited a blue shift with 5.5-fold increase in emission intensity on binding with A beta aggregates. Blood kinetics of the complex performed on normal rabbit exhibited fast clearance (t(1/2)(F) = 24 +/- 0.08 min; t(1/2)(S) = 2 h 40 +/- 0.04 min). Ex vivo biodistribution analysis demonstrated blood-brain barrier penetration with brain uptake of 1.24 +/- 0.31% ID g(-1) at 2 min p.i. and rapid washout with negligible activity (0.36% ID g(-1)) left at 30 min p.i. These preliminary studies reveal that the bivalent approach of synthesis had minimal effect on binding affinity, signifying that the developed Ga-68-complex, Ga-68-DT(Ch)(2), may offer a new perspective in generator produced PET imaging probes for Alzheimer's disease.

[F-18]DPA-714 is a specific tracer of the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO), which is overexpressed on activated macrophages, and proposed as a biomarker of neuroinflammation. Today, diagnosis of patients with early inflammatory arthritis is limited by poor sensitivity and specificity. The present study aims to investigate the potential of [F-18]DPA-714 to monitor in vivo inflammatory processes at a preclinical stage via positron emission tomography (PET). Methods: RA was induced in Dark Agouti rats by subcutaneous injection of inactivated Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Development of arthritis clinical signs was investigated daily and the severity of the disease evaluated. Animals were imaged at the peak of inflammation using [F-18]DPA-714 and a small-animal PET-CT tomograph. Results: The first clinical signs appeared at 10 days post-injection, with a peak of inflammation at 20 days. At this time, PET-analyses showed a clear uptake of [F-18]DPA-714 in swollen ankles, with mean values of 0.52 +/- 0.18% injected dose (ID/cc) for treated (n = 11) and 0.19 +/- 0.09 for non-treated (n = 6) rats. A good correlation between [F-18]DPA-714's uptake and swelling was also found. Immunohistochemistry showed an enhanced TSPO expression in hind paws, mainly co-localized with the macrophages specific antigen CD68 expressing cells. Conclusion: These preliminary results demonstrate that the TSPO 18kDa specific radioligand [F-18]DPA-714 is adapted for the study and follow-up of inflammation linked to RA in our experimental model, suggesting also a strong potential for clinical imaging of peripheral inflammation.

This mechanism possibly depends on the interregional balance between SERTs in the raphe nuclei and in terminal regions before treatment. To evaluate these hypotheses on a systems level in humans in vivo, we investigated SERT availability and occupancy longitudinally in patients with major depressive disorder using positron emission tomography (PET) and the radioligand [C-11]DASB. Measurements were performed before and after a single oral dose, as well as after three weeks (mean 24.73 +/- 3.3 days) of continuous oral treatment with either escitalopram (10 mg/day) or citalopram (20 mg/day). Data were analyzed using voxel-wise linear regression and ANOVA to evaluate SERT binding, occupancy and binding ratios (SERT binding of the entire brain compared to SERT binding in the dorsal and median raphe nuclei) in relation to treatment outcome. Regression analysis revealed that treatment response was predicted by pre-treatment SERT binding ratios, i.e., SERT binding in key regions of depression including bilateral habenula, amygdala-hippocampus complex and subgenual cingulate cortex in relation to SERT binding in the median but not dorsal raphe nucleus (p<0.05 FDR-corrected). Similar results were observed in the direct comparison of responders and non-responders. Our data provide a first proof-of-concept for recent modeling studies and further underlie the importance of the habenula and subgenual cingulate cortex in the etiology of and recovery from major depression. These findings may indicate a promising molecular predictor of treatment response and stimulate new treatment approaches based on regional differences in SERT binding. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Immunohistochemical localization and quantitative expression of somatostatin receptors in normal human spleen and thymus: Implications for the <i>in vivo</i> visualization during somatostatin receptor scintigraphy	JOURNAL OF ENDOCRINOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION			English	Article						Receptor interaction; somatostatin; somatostatin receptors; spleen; thymus	IMMUNE-SYSTEM; SUBTYPES; OCTREOTIDE; CELLS; VITRO; THYMOMA; SST(2A); TUMORS; SST2A; TISSUE	Background: [In-111-DTPA-D-Phe(1)]-octreotide scintigraphy allows the visualization of SRIF receptor (SSR)-expressing tumors, including thymic tumors, and normal tissues. While the spleen is clearly visualized, the thymus is not depicted, although both contain SSR. Aim: We evaluated whether the heterogeneity, the type, and the amount of SSR might explain this contrasting finding. Materials, methods, and results: By ligand-binding the number of [I-125-Tyr(11)]-SRIF-14 binding sites resulted comparable between the two tissues, whereas the number of [I-125-Tyr(3)]-octreotide sites was significantly higher in the spleen (p<0.001). Quantitative RTPCR showed a significantly higher expression of sst(2A) mRNA in the spleen, whereas a significantly higher expression of SRIF and sst(3) in the thymus. The highest density of sst(2A) in the spleen is in line with the in vivo uptake of [In-111-DTPA-D-Phe(1)]- octreotide, which is considered a sst(2)-preferring ligand. The specificity is confirmed by the evidence that in vivo [In-111-DTPA-D-Phe(1)]-octreotide uptake can be abolished during chronic administration of "cold" octreotide. Immunohistochemistry confirmed a preferential expression of sst(2A) on microenvironmental cells and of sst(3) on lymphoid cells. Conclusions: The heterogeneity of SSR expression and the higher SRIF content explain the lack of thymus visualization during scintigraphy, whereas thymic tumors, which do not express SRIF, are visualized. Apart from the affinity of the radioligand, also the efficacy of the internalization is crucial for the in vivo uptake, and both heterogeneity and SRIF content affect this process. These observations might have an important impact when interpretating in vivo visualization of SSR-positive lesions, and when treatment with novel SRIF analogs is considered. (J. Endocrinol.

G-protein βγ subunits in vasorelaxing and anti-endothelinergic effects of calcitonin gene-related peptide	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						CGRP receptor; vascular smooth muscle; G-proteins; endothelin; 7-transmembrane domain receptors	SMALL-MOLECULE DISRUPTION; SMOOTH-MUSCLE-CELLS; SELECTIVE INHIBITOR; ADENYLYL CYCLASES; BINDING-SITES; NITRIC-OXIDE; RECEPTOR; POTENT; CGRP; RAT	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) has been proposed to relax vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) via cAMP and can promote dissociation of endothelin-1 (ET-1) from ETA receptors. The latter is not mimicked by other stimuli of adenylate cyclases. Therefore, we evaluated the involvement of G-protein beta? subunits (G beta?) in the arterial effects of CGRP receptor stimulation. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH To test the hypothesis that instead of a subunits of G-proteins (Gas), Gbg mediates the effects of CGRP receptor activation, we used (i) rat isolated mesenteric resistance arteries (MRA), (ii) pharmacological modulators of cyclic nucleotides; and (iii) low molecular weight inhibitors of the functions of Gbg, gallein and M119. To validate these tools with respect to CGRP receptor function, we performed organ bath studies with rat isolated MRA, radioligand binding on membranes from CHO cells expressing human CGRP receptors and cAMP production assays in rat cultured VSMC. KEY RESULTS In isolated arteries contracted with K+ or ET-1, IBMX (PDE inhibitor) increased sodium nitroprusside (SNP)-and isoprenaline (ISO)-but not CGRP-induced relaxations. While fluorescein (negative control) was without effects, gallein increased binding of [ 125I]-CGRP in the absence and presence of GTPgS. Gallein also increased CGRP-induced cAMP production in VSMC. Despite these stimulating effects, gallein and M119 selectively inhibited the relaxing and anti-endothelinergic effects of CGRP in isolated arteries while not altering contractile responses to K+ or ET-1 or relaxing responses to ISO or SNP. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS Activated CGRP receptors induce cyclic nucleotide-independent relaxation of VSMC and terminate arterial effects of ET-1 via Gbg.	[De Mey, J. G.

EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH GSK1004723 was characterized in vitro and in vivo using methods that included radioligand binding, intracellular calcium mobilization, cAMP production, GTP gamma S binding, superfused human bronchus and guinea pig whole body plethysmography. KEY RESULTS In cell membranes over-expressing human recombinant H-1 and H-3 receptors, GSK1004723 displayed high affinity, competitive binding (H-1 pKi = 10.2; H-3 pKi = 10.6). In addition, GSK1004723 demonstrated slow dissociation from both receptors with a t(1/2) of 1.2 and 1.5 h for H-1 and H-3 respectively. GSK1004723 specifically antagonized H-1 receptor mediated increases in intracellular calcium and H-3 receptor mediated increases in GTP gamma S binding. The antagonism exerted was retained after cell washing, consistent with slow dissociation from H-1 and H-3 receptors. Duration of action was further evaluated using superfused human bronchus preparations. GSK1004723 (100 nmol.L-1) reversed an established contractile response to histamine. When GSK1004723 was removed from the perfusate, only 20% recovery of the histamine response was observed over 10 h. Moreover, 21 h post-exposure to GSK1004723 there remained almost complete antagonism of responses to histamine. In vivo pharmacology was studied in conscious guinea pigs in which nasal congestion induced by intranasal histamine was measured indirectly (plethysmography). GSK1004723 (0.1 and 1 mg.mL(-1) intranasal) antagonized the histamine-induced response with a duration of up to 72 h. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS GSK1004723 is a potent and selective histamine H-1 and H-3 receptor antagonist with a long duration of action and represents a potential novel therapy for allergic rhinitis.

Primary human monocytes, a human monocytic cell line, and monocyte-derived macrophage cells were used to measure expression of the proinflammatory mediator interleukin (IL)-1 beta responding to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the presence or absence of alpha(1)-AR activation. Based on our previous findings, we hypothesized that alpha(1)-AR stimulation on innate immune cells positively regulates LPS-initiated IL-1 beta production. IL-1 beta production in response to LPS was synergistically higher for both monocytes and macrophages in the presence of the selective alpha(1)-AR agonist (R)-(-)-phenylephrine hydrochloride (PE). This synergistic IL-1 beta response could be blocked with a selective alpha(1)-AR antagonist as well as inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC). Radioligand binding studies characterized a homogenous alpha(1B)-AR subtype population on monocytes, which changed to a heterogeneous receptor subtype expression pattern when differentiated to macrophages. Furthermore, increased p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation was observed only with concurrent PE and LPS stimulation, peaking after 120 and 30 min in monocytes and macrophages, respectively. Blocking the PKC/p38 MAPK signaling pathway in both innate immune cell types inhibited the synergistic IL-1 beta increase observed with concurrent PE and LPS treatments. This study characterizes alpha(1)-AR subtype expression on both human monocyte and macrophage cells and illustrates a mechanism by which increased IL-1 beta production can be modulated by alpha(1)-AR input.

In addition to serve as a useful biochemical marker, MMP expression may also provide a target for the diagnostic in vivo imaging of tumors, using a radiolabeled inhibitor. This study investigates the use of membrane type 1 (MT1)-MMP as target for in vivo tumor diagnosis. Specific binding of the endogenous tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) to MT1-MMP has been previously described. In this study, biodistribution and imaging experiments were performed on MT1-MMP-overexpressing (S.1.5) and control (C.IV.3) tumor-inoculated mice using [I-123]recombinant human TIMP-2 (rhTIMP-2) as radioligand and [I-123]-rhTIMP-1 as control. The expression profile was controlled in vitro and on tumor extracts. rhTIMP-2 as well as rhTIMP-1 were labeled using the Iodogen method and characterized. Biodistribution of [I-123]-rhTIMP-2 showed a tumor uptake of 2.87% +/- 1.58% ID/g at 3 hours postinjection in S.1.5. Tumor values of [I-123]-rhTIMP-1 and [I-123]-rhTIMP-2 evaluated in S.1.5 and C.IV.3, respectively, were significantly lower. Planar imaging revealed significant uptake of [I-123]-rhTIMP-2 in S.1.5 compared with contralateral background areas. This could not be observed in C.IV.3 and with [I-123]-rhTIMP-1 in S.1.5. All tumors were well established (200-800 mg). These results suggest that rhTIMP-2 holds potential for development of radiotracers for in vivo imaging in overexpressing MT1-MMP but not in similar tumors that do not express this protease.

The receptor has important roles in the cardiovascular system and is commonly used as a drug target in cardiovascular diseases. Interaction of 7TM receptors with G proteins or beta-arrestins often induces higher binding affinity for agonists. Here, we examined interactions between AT(1A) receptors and beta-arrestins to look for differences between the AT(1A) receptor interaction with beta-arrestin1 and beta-arrestin2. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Ligand-induced interaction between AT(1A) receptors and beta-arrestins was measured by Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer 2. AT(1A)-beta-arrestin1 and AT(1A)-beta-arrestin2 fusion proteins were cloned and tested for differences using immunocytochemistry, inositol phosphate hydrolysis and competition radioligand binding. KEY RESULTS Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer 2 analysis showed that beta-arrestin1 and 2 were recruited to AT(1A) receptors with similar ligand potencies and efficacies. The AT(1A)-beta-arrestin fusion proteins showed attenuated G protein signalling and increased agonist binding affinity, while antagonist affinity was unchanged. Importantly, larger agonist affinity shifts were observed for AT(1A)-beta-arrestin2 than for AT(1A)-beta-arrestin1. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS beta-Arrestin1 and 2 are recruited to AT(1A) receptors with similar ligand pharmacology and stabilize AT(1A) receptors in distinct high-affinity conformations. However, beta-arrestin2 induces a receptor conformation with a higher agonist-binding affinity than beta-arrestin1. Thus, this study demonstrates that beta-arrestins interact with AT(1A) receptors in different ways and suggest that AT(1) receptor biased agonists with the ability to recruit either of the beta-arrestins selectively, would be possible to design.

Investigation of the distribution and function of α-adrenoceptors in the sheep isolated internal anal sphincter	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						imidazoline; faecal incontinence; radioligand binding; l-erythro-methoxamine	L-ERYTHRO-METHOXAMINE; TOPICAL PHENYLEPHRINE; FECAL INCONTINENCE; RESTING PRESSURE; SMOOTH-MUSCLE; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; BINDING-SITES; IN-VITRO; RECEPTORS; PIG	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE We have investigated the distribution of alpha-adrenoceptors in sheep internal anal sphincter (IAS), as a model for the human tissue, and evaluated various imidazoline derivatives for potential treatment of faecal incontinence. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Saturation and competition binding with 3H-prazosin and 3H-RX821002 were used to confirm the presence and density of alpha-adrenoceptors in sheep IAS, and the affinity of imidazoline compounds at these receptors. A combination of in vitro receptor autoradiography and immunohistochemistry was used to investigate the regional distribution of binding sites. Contractile activity of imidazoline-based compounds on sheep IAS was assessed by isometric tension recording. KEY RESULTS Saturation binding confirmed the presence of both alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-adrenoceptors, and subsequent characterization with sub-type-selective agents, identified them as alpha(1A)- and alpha(2D)-adrenoceptor sub-types. Autoradiographic studies with 3H-prazosin showed a positive association of alpha(1)-adrenoceptors with immunohistochemically identified smooth muscle fibres. Anti-alpha(1)-adrenoceptor immunohistochemistry revealed similar distributions of the receptor in sheep and human IAS. The imidazoline compounds caused concentration-dependent contractions of the anal sphincter, but the maximum responses were less than those elicited by l-erythro-methoxamine, a standard non-imidazoline alpha(1)-adrenoceptor agonist. Prazosin (selective alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist) significantly reduced the magnitude of contraction to l-erythro-methoxamine at the highest concentration used. Both prazosin and RX811059 (a selective alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist) reduced the potency (pEC(50)) of clonidine. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS This study shows that both alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-adrenoceptors are expressed in the sheep IAS, and contribute (perhaps synergistically) to contractions elicited by various imidazoline derivatives. These agents may prove useful in the treatment of faecal incontinence.	[Wilson, V. G.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Med, Queens Med Ctr, Sch Biomed Sci, Nottingham NG7 2UH, England; [Rayment, S.

Novel effects mediated by bradykinin and pharmacological characterization of bradykinin B<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonism in human synovial fibroblasts	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						MEN16132; icatibant; osteoarthritis; knee; synovium; interleukin-6; interleukin-8; cyclooxygenase; lipoxygenase	SMOOTH-MUSCLE-CELLS; NF-KAPPA-B; KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS; ENHANCED EXPRESSION; RELEASE NEUTROPHIL; LUNG FIBROBLASTS; KININ RECEPTORS; IL-8 PRODUCTION; ACTIVATION; CYTOKINES	Background and purpose: Bradykinin (BK) and B-2 receptors have been implicated in the pathophysiology of osteoarthritis (OA), and synovitis is one of its hallmarks. Here, the selective B-2 receptor antagonists MEN16132 and icatibant have been pharmacologically characterized in human synovial cells. Experimental approach: Radioligand and functional studies (inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 release) were performed in cultured synoviocytes. Key results: [3H]-BK saturation studies indicated receptor density (B-max) and K-d values of 121 550 sites per cell and 1.14 nM respectively. In synoviocytes, MEN16132 (pK(i) 8.9) was threefold more potent than icatibant (pK(i) 8.4). Both antagonists showed competitive antagonism in the BK-induced IP assay (control EC50 0.45 nM), with pK(B) values of 9.9 (MEN16132) and 8.1 (icatibant). 24h incubation with BK induced IL-6 (EC50 216 nM) and IL-8 (EC50 53 nM) release. Both MEN16132 (IL-6: pIC(50) 8.1; IL-8: pIC(50) 8.4) and icatibant (IL-6: pIC(50) 6.6; IL-8: pIC(50) 6.7) completely prevented this BK-induced release. Indomethacin did not affect the basal or the IL-6/IL-8 release induced by BK, whereas nordihydroguaiaretic acid decreased the basal release, although BK still increased IL-6 and IL-8 production. BK-induced IL-8 release was attenuated by inhibitors of phospholipase C (U73122), p38 (SB203580), JNK (SP600125), ERK 1/2 (PD98059) MAPKs, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (LY294002), NF-kappa b (BAY-117085) and by the glucocorticoid dexamethasone. Conclusions and implications: Bradykinin via B-2 receptors can participate in inflammatory events in synovitis. MEN16132 is a highly potent B-2 receptor antagonist capable of blocking pro-inflammatory responses to BK evoked in human synoviocytes.

Since dopamine transporter (DAT) is a protein located presynaptically on dopaminergic nerve terminals, radioligands that bind to these sites arc promising radiopharmaceuticals for evaluation of the integrity of the dopamine system. This study using positron emission tomography (PET) tracers, [C-11]-2-carbomethoxy-3-(4-fluorophenyl)-tropane ([C-11]beta-CFT, radioligand for DAT), was aimed at evaluating the degree of nigrostriatal damage and its change over weeks in a rat model of PD. Methods: The brains of these rats were unilaterally lesioned by mechanical transection of the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway at the medial forebrain bundle (MFB). Behavioral studies were carried out by apomorphine (APO) challenge prior to and 1, 2 and 4 weeks after MFB axotomy. Small animal PET scans were performed 2 days after the behavioral test. Immunohistochemisty was conducted 4 days after the last PET scan. Results: Compared with the contralateral intact side, a progressively decreased [C-11]beta-CFT binding was observed oil the lesioned side which correlated inversely with the APO-induced rotations. Postmortem immunohistochemical studies confirmed the loss of both striatal dopamine fibers and nigral neurons on the lesioned side. Conclusion: These Findings not only demonstrate that the neuronal degeneration in this model is relatively slow, but also suggest [C-11]beta-CFT is a sensitive marker to monitor the degree of nigrostriatal damage and lis change over weeks. This marker can be used prospectively to study the progression of the disease, thereby making detection of early phases of PD possible. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The current study was undertaken to characterize in vivo muscarinic receptor subtype selectivity of solifenacin in the bladder and submandibular gland by using muscarinic receptor subtype knockout (KO) mice. Muscarinic receptors in the bladder and submandibular gland of wild type, M2R KO and M3R KO mice under in vitro and after oral administration of solifenacin and oxybutynin were measured by radioligand binding assay using [N-methyl-H-3]scopolamine ([H-3]NMS). There was little difference between the bladder and submandibular gland of M2R KO mice in the receptor binding activities of oxybutynin and solifenacin in vitro, suggesting equal affinity for residual (predominantly M-3 subtype) muscarinic receptors in both tissues. In contrast, compared with oral oxybutynin, oral administration of solifenacin exerted a significantly greater activity to bind muscarinic receptors in the bladder of M2R KO mice, while exhibiting a significantly less activity to bind those in the submandibular gland. In the bladder and submandibular gland of M3R KO mice, the binding activity of solifenacin and oxybutynin showed no significant difference. Plasma concentrations of solifenacin and oxybutynin after oral administration differed little among wild type, M2R KO and M3R KO mice. The results indicate that oral solifenacin, unlike oral oxybutynin, may selectively bind to the muscarinic M-3 subtype in the bladder compared with such receptors in the submandibular gland in vivo. Oral solifenacin may be advantageous for the treatment of overactive bladder, in terms of high affinity for M-3 receptors in the bladder. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Experimental approach: Effects of the cannabinoid agonist CP-55,940 and the H-3 receptor agonist imetit on electrically induced tachycardic and vasopressor responses, respectively, was compared in pithed rats anaesthetized with urethane or pentobarbitone. The affinity of urethane for the three receptors was measured by radioligand binding studies in rat brain cortex membranes and its potency assessed in superfused mouse tissues preincubated with H-3-noradrenaline. Key results: The neurogenic tachycardic response was less markedly inhibited by CP-55,940 in urethane- than in pentobarbitone-anaesthetized pithed rats. Imetit inhibited the neurogenic vasopressor response after pentobarbitone but not after urethane. The catecholamine-induced tachycardic and vasopressor response did not differ between rats anaesthetized with either compound. Urethane 10 mM (plasma concentration reached under anaesthesia) did not affect binding to CB1 or H-3 receptors and alpha(2) adrenoceptors, nor did it alter the inhibitory effect of agonists at the three receptors on electrically evoked H-3-noradrenaline release. Conclusions and implications: Urethane, but not pentobarbitone, abolished the H-3 receptor-mediated vascular response in pithed rats and attenuated the CB1 receptor-mediated cardiac response much more than pentobarbitone. The weaker effects of CB1, H-3 and alpha(2) receptor agonists cannot be explained by antagonism by urethane at the three receptors in vitro. Pentobarbitone, but not urethane, is suitable as an anaesthetic for investigations of inhibitory presynaptic receptor function in pithed and anaesthetized rats.	[Kurz, C.

Therefore, we investigated the cardiac effects of the trace amines p-tyramine, beta-phenylethylamine, octopamine, and tryptamine. Isolated rat hearts were perfused in the presence of trace amines, monitoring the hemodynamic variables. In addition, radioligand binding experiments with [H-3]-p-tyramine and [I-125]-3-iodothyronamine were performed in rat ventricular tissue. Octopamine, beta-phenylethylamine, and tryptamine produced a dose-dependent negative inotropic effect as shown by reduced cardiac Output (IC50 = 109 mu M, 159 mu M and 242 mu M, respectively). In the same preparation a similar effect was produced by thyronamine and 3-iodothyronamine, with IC50=94 mu M and 27 mu M, respectively. The negative inotropic effect of octopamine was confirmed in a papillary muscle preparation. All trace amines except tryptamine increased the heart rate, but this action could be attributed to their sympathomimetic properties, since it was abolished by propranolol. The negative inotropic effect of trace amines was significantly increased by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. Specific and saturable binding of [H-3]-p-tyramine and [I-125]-3-iodothyronamine was observed in ventricular tissue. While [H-3]-p-tyramine was displaced by 3-iodothyronamine, [I-125]-3-iodothyronamine was not displaced by p-tyramine. In conclusion, trace amines and thyronamines are negative inotropic agents. Their effect appears to be mediated by a subtype of trace amine-associated receptor which is characterized by the rank of potency: 3-iodothyronamine > thyronamine = octopamine = beta-phenylethylamine, while tryptamine and p-tyramine are significantly less active.

GRPRs have been found in a variety of cancers including invasive breast and prostate tumors. The peptide MP2346 (DOTA-(Pro(1),Tyr(4))-bombesin(1-14)) was designed to bind to these GRP receptors. This study was undertaken to evaluate radiolabeled MP2346 as a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent. MP2346 was radiolabeled, in high radiochemical purity, with the positron-emitting nuclides Cu-64 (t(1/2) = 12.7 h, beta(+) = 19.3%, E-avg = 278 keV) and Y-86 (t(1/2) = 14.7 h, beta(+) = 33%, E-avg = 664 keV). Cu-64-MP2346 and Y-86-MP2346 were studied in vitro for cellular internalization by GRPR-expressing PC-3 (human prostate adenocarcinoma) cells. Both Cu-64- and Y-86-MP2346 were studied in vivo for tissue distribution in nude mice with PC-3 tumors. Biodistribution in PC3 tumor-bearing mice demonstrated higher tumor uptake, but lower liver retention, in animals injected with Y-86-MP2346 compared to Cu-64-MP2346. Receptor-mediated uptake was confirmed by a significant reduction in uptake in the PC-3 tumor and other receptor-rich tissues by coinjection of a blockade. Small animal PET/CT imaging was carried out in mice bearing PC-3 tumors and rats bearing AR42J tumors. It was possible to delineate PC-3 tumors in vivo with Cu-64-MP2346, but superior Y-86-MP2346-PET images were obtained due to lower uptake in clearance organs and lower background activity. The Y-86 analogue demonstrated excellent PET image quality in models of prostate cancer for the delineation of the GRPR-rich tumors and warrants further investigation.

In AD, there is a selective decrease in the numbers of radioligand binding sites corresponding to the most abundant nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAChR) subtype, which contains human alpha4 and beta2 subunits (halpha4beta2-nAChR). However, the relationships between these phenomena are uncertain, and effects of Abeta on halpha4beta2-nAChR function have not been investigated in detail. We first confirmed expression of halpha4 and hbeta2 subunits as messenger RNA in transfected, human SH-EP1 cells by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and mRNA fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses. Immunoprecipitation Western analyses confirmed alpha4 and beta2 subunit protein expression and coassembly. Whole cell current recording demonstrated heterologous expression in SH-EP1-halpha4beta2 cells of functional halpha4beta2-nAChRs with characteristic responses to nicotinic agonists or antagonists. Nicotine-induced whole cell currents were suppressed by Abeta(1-42) in a dose-dependent manner. Functional inhibition was selective for Abeta(1-42) compared with the functionally inactive, control peptide Abeta(40-1). Abeta(1-42)-mediated inhibition of halpha4beta2-nAChR function was non-competitive, voltage-independent, and use-independent. Pre-loading of cells with guanyl-5'-yl thiophosphate failed to prevent Abeta(1-42)-induced inhibition, suggesting that down-regulation of halpha4beta2-nAChR function by Abeta(1-42) is not mediated by nAChR internalization. Sensitivity to Abeta(1-42) antagonism at 1 nM was evident for halpha4beta2-nAChRs, but not for heterologously expressed human alpha7-nAChRs, although both nAChR subtypes were functionally inhibited by 100 nM Abeta(1-42), with the magnitude of functional block being higher for 100 nM Abeta(1-42) acting on halpha7-nAChRs. These findings suggest that halpha4beta2-nAChRs are sensitive and perhaps pathophysiologically relevant targets for Abeta neurotoxicity in AD.

Homologous down-regulation/desensitization of the parathyroid hormone receptor (PTH1R)/adenylate cyclase system has been demonstrated in uremia, and may contribute to parathyroid hormone (PTH) resistance; however, additional studies have shown that parathyroidectomy fails to normalize the down-regulation of the PTH1R. The present studies were designed to test directly, in vitro, the hypothesis that factors circulating in the uremic environment, other than PTH, decrease the response of osteoblastic cells to PTH. Methods. Studies were conducted in confluent cultures of UMR 106-01 osteoblast-like cells. Uremic ultrafiltrate (UUF) was obtained from patients on hemodialysis. Cells were exposed to media containing 50% uremic ultrafiltrate for periods of up to 72 hours. Control cultures were exposed to a buffered salt solution containing a comparable ionic composition to that of the UUF. PTH-stimulated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) generation was determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA), PTH binding and PTH1R mRNA levels were determined by radioligand binding and Northern analysis, respectively. Results. PTH-stimulated cAMP generation from cultures treated with uremic ultrafiltrate for 48 hours was 1385.8 +/- 183.2 pmol/culture/5 minutes, whereas control cultures generated 2389.5 +/- 271 pmol cAMP/culture/5 minutes (P < 0.05). PTH binding was decreased by 30% in cultures incubated with UUF as compared to controls. The decrease in binding induced by UUF was accompanied by a decrease in PTH1R mRNA levels. Conclusion. These findings demonstrate that factors present in UUF decrease PTH-stimulated cAMP generation by a mechanism that involves a decrease in the levels of PTH1R mRNA levels. Thus, the skeletal resistance to PTH in the setting of chronic kidney disease, may be explained, at least in part, by circulating factors other than PTH.

The reconstructed transaxial resolution of 3.5 min full width at half-maximum and the system sensitivity of 0.081 c/s/kBq using a 2.0-mm pinhole collimator aperture provided adequate spatial detail and sufficient sensitivity for imaging striatal beta-[I-123]CIT uptake. SPECT images, coregistered onto a MRI template, showed high accuracy in the coronal and transverse planes (maximum mismatch of 1.3 mm). Following estimation of the in vivo binding equilibrium of beta-[I-123]CIT in the healthy rat striatum, we evaluated the 6-hydroxydopamine-induced loss of striatal DAT function using beta-[I-123]CIT SPECT and MRI coregistration and correlated these findings with dopaminergic cell counts in the substantia nigra pars compacta using TH immunohistochemistry. A subtotal unilateral DAT deficit was detected by beta-[I-123]CIT SPECT in all animals which correlated significantly with the cell counting of the remaining dopaminergic neurons. beta-[I-123]CIT pinhole SPECT provides a powerful and widely available tool for in vivo investigations of rat striatal DAT function. In contrast to classical autoradiography, the present method will be helpful in imaging dynamic changes of neurotransmission in the CNS by virtue of serial study designs. Depending on SPECT ligand availability, a wide range of other CNS receptors may be imaged as well using the presented in vivo technique. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

It is supplied with a dopaminergic innervation arising from the midbrain, which is part of the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway. Dysfunction of the dopaminergic mesolimbic system is probably involved in the pathophysiology of psychosis and behavioural disturbances occurring in the elderly. The present study was designed to assess the density and localisation of dopamine D1- and D2-like receptor subtypes in the hippocampus of male Sprague-Dawley rats aged 3 months (young), 12 months (adult) and 24 months (old). Dopamine D1-like receptors, labelled by [H-3]-SCH 23390, in young rats displayed a dentate gyrus-CA1 subfield gradient. The expression was increased in the cell body of dentate gyrus, CA4 and CA3 subfield of old rats compared to younger cohorts, as well as in the neuropil of dentate gyrus. A decreased density of dopamine D1-like receptors was found in the stratum oriens of CA1 and CA3 subfields. Dopamine D2-like receptors, labelled using [H-3]-spiperone as radioligand, were expressed rather homogeneously throughout different subfields of the hippocampus. In old rats, the density of dopamine D2-like receptors was decreased in the dentate gyrus, unchanged in the CA4 and CA1 subfields. and increased in the CA3 subfield. The above results indicate the occurrence of inhomogeneous changes in the density of dopamine D1- and D2-like receptors in specific portions of hippocampus of old rats. These findings support the hypothesis of an involvement of dopaminergic system in behavioural abnormalities or psychosis occurring in ageing. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

It has been suggested that these two receptor subtypes are species orthologs, since the alpha (2)-adrenoceptors of a given species have pharmacological characteristics corresponding to either the alpha (2a)- (human, pig) or alpha (2d)- (rat, mouse, guinea pig, cow) adrenoceptor. Radioligand binding assays in rabbit adipocyte suggest alpha (2D)-adrenoceptor pharmacology. However, functional studies examining prejunctional alpha (2)-adrenoceptors in several tissues pharmacologically define the receptor of the rabbit as an alpha (2A)-adrenoceptor rather than an alpha (2D)-adrenoceptor. We characterized the alpha (2)-adrenoceptor of rabbit adipocyte and platelet, comparing the ability of norepinephrine and 13 adrenoceptor antagonists to inhibit the binding of [H-3]RX821002 with the affinity of these drugs for the human alpha (2a)-adrenoceptor or the rat alpha (2d)-adrenoceptor. Pharmacological characteristics of the adipocyte and platelet receptor were very similar, with an excellent correlation between pK(i) values (r(2) = 0.95, slope of regression = 1.01). Drug affinities for both platelet and adipocyte receptors correlated better with the alpha (2a)-adrenoceptor (r(2) = 0.68-0.77) than with the alpha (2d)-adrenoceptor (r(2) = 0.37-0.38). Despite the relatively low affinity of the rabbit adipocyte alpha (2)-adrenoceptor for yohimbine and rauwolscine, this receptor, as well as the platelet receptor, have alpha (2A)-adrenoceptor pharmacology. Subtle differences in the alpha (2)-adrenoceptor binding characteristics of these native rabbit tissues compared with the recombinant human alpha (2a)-adrenoceptor may result either from minor differences in the sequence of human and rabbit alpha (2a)-adrenoceptors or from differences in the environment to which native and recombinant receptors are exposed.

Inhibition of spontaneous or drug-induced uterine contractions by KUR-1246 was evaluated in pregnant rats and rabbits by an organ bath method or by a balloon method. The selectivity of KUR-1246 was assessed simultaneously in organs isolated from late-pregnant rats. The affinity of KUR-1246 for human beta1-, beta2-, and beta3-ARs was determined using two radioligands. KUR-1246 suppressed both spontaneous and drug-induced contractions in isolated uteri, the rank order of potency being isoproterenol. KUR-1246. terbutaline. ritodrine. ICI-118551 (selective beta2-AR antagonist) competitively antagonized the KUR-1246-induced inhibition of spontaneous uterine contractions, but CGP-20712A (selective beta1-AR antagonist) and SR-58894A (selective beta3-AR antagonist) did not. All beta -AR agonists tested produced significant inhibition of spontaneous uterine contractions in vivo: ED30 value for KUR-1246 was 0.13 mug/kg/min, a potency about 6 times and 400 times greater than that of terbutaline and ritodrine, respectively. In contrast, the positive chronotropic effect was minimal in KUR-1246-treated rats. KUR-1246 displaced radioligand binding to beta1-, beta2-, and beta3-ARs, the pK(i) values being 5.75 +/- 0.03, 7.59 +/- 0.08, and 4.75 +/- 0.03 for beta1-, beta2-, and beta3-ARs, respectively. For the selectivity of KUR-1246 for human beta2-AR, we obtained values of 39.2 ([IC50 for beta1-AR]/[ IC50 for beta2-AR]) and 198.2 ([ IC50 for b3- AR]/[ IC50 for beta2-AR]), indicating an apparently higher affinity for human beta2-AR than for other beta -AR subtypes. The present study clearly demonstrated that KUR-1246 is a more selective beta2-AR agonist than the drugs presently used for relaxing uterine muscle.

Functional experiments were carried out in isolated muscle preparations of human left ventricular myocardium from failing hearts. 4 Bucindolol and carvedilol bound non-selectively to beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors and exerted guanine nucleotide modulatable binding. Metoprolol was 35-fold beta(1)-selective and lacked guanine nucleotide modulatable binding. 5 All beta-blockers antagonized isoprenaline-induced enhancement of contractility. 6 In preparations in which the coupling of the stimulatory G-protein to adenylate cyclase was facilitated by forskolin, bucindolol increased force of contraction in three and decreased it in five experiments. Carvedilol increased force in one and decreased it in six experiments. Metoprolol decreased force in all experiments by 89.4+/-2.2% (P<0.01 metoprolol vs carvedilol and bucindolol). The negative inotropic effect of metoprolol was antagonized by bucindolol. 7 It is concluded that differences in intrinsic activity can be detected in human myocardium and have an impact on cardiac contractility. In human ventricular myocardium, bucindolol displays substantially higher intrinsic activity than metoprolol and carvedilol. Bucindolol can behave as partial agonist or partial inverse agonist depending on the examined tissue. 8 Differences in intrinsic activity may contribute to differences in beta-adrenoceptor regulation and possibly to differences in tolerability and outcomes of patients with heart failure.

After intravenous injection of p-[F-18]MPPF in cats, there was a rapid accumulation of radioactivity in the brain, with 4% of the total radioactivity injected present in the brain at 4 minutes postinjection. The highest uptakes of radioactivity were observed in the hippocampus and cingulate cortex, regions known to be rich in 5-HT1A receptors, whereas lower levels of radioactivity were observed in the cerebellum. The mean ratio of radioactivity in the hippocampus to the cerebellum was 4.29 (SD = 0.21; n = 5) from 40 to 90 minutes postinjection of p-[F-18]MPPF. The corresponding ratio for the cingulate cortex was 3.01 (SD = 0.16; n = 5). Specific binding in the hippocampus and the cingulate cortex was markedly reduced following injection of unlabeled WAY-100635 and pindolol but was unaffected by treatment with alpha 1, 5-HT2, or reuptake inhibitor agents indicating reversibility and selectivity of p-[F-18]MPPF binding to 5-HT1A receptors. Ex vivo autoradiographic study with p-[F-18]MPPF in cat brain sections showed labeling of areas rich in 5-HT1A receptors with a regional brain distribution that closely matched that observed using PET. These results indicate that p-[F-18]MPPF may be a useful candidate for noninvasive PET imaging of 5-HT1A receptors in the living human brain. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

CANCERS			English	Article						anaplastic thyroid carcinoma; poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma; prostate-specific membrane antigen; theranostic; neovasculature; immunohistochemistry; treatment	RENAL-CELL CARCINOMA; ASSOCIATION GUIDELINES; PSMA EXPRESSION; PET/CT; MANAGEMENT; TOMOGRAPHY; VALIDATION	Simple Summary: Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted therapy represents a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of advanced carcinoma, but data on the relevance of PSMA-targeted diagnostics and therapy for anaplastic (ATC) and poorly differentiated (PDTC) thyroid carcinoma are still lacking. Due to the limited therapeutic options for these entities, the aim of this study was to evaluate to what extent Gallium-68 (Ga-68)-PSMA-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is superior to F-(18)-Fluordeoxyglucose (F-18-FDG)-PET/CT in the diagnostic of ATC/PDTC and could represent a new therapeutic option in terms of theranostic. The findings of this study confirm the high diagnostic sensitivity and superiority of F-18-FDG-PET/CT in comparison to Ga-68-PSMA-PET/CT in the diagnosis of ATC and PDTC. However, it can be suggested that Ga-68-PMSA-PET/CT can be considered as a beneficial adjunct to the well-established F-18-FDG-PET/CT for a few individual selected patients with ATC and PDTC to detect lesions not discovered by F-18-FDG-PET/CT and to determine patients' eligibility for a radioligand therapy. With regard to our results, radiolabelled PSMA-ligands with Lutetium-177 (Lu-177)-PSMA may, in the future, represent a theranostic approach with only minor side effects for a few individual selected patients with ATC and PDTC who need alternative treatment options in case of progression when established therapies are no longer effective. Several studies have demonstrated an expression of the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) in the cancer-related neovasculature of thyroid malignancies. Due to the poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options for patients with anaplastic (ATC) and poorly differentiated (PDTC) thyroid carcinoma, the aim of our study was to investigate the theranostic approach of PSMA expression in these patients. The PSMA uptake on Gallium-68 (Ga-68)-PSMA-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and glucose uptake on F-18-Fluordeoxyglucose (F-18-FDG)-PET/CTs were analysed in two ATC and six PDTC patients. The PSMA expression in corresponding patients' tissue samples was detected by immunohistochemistry. In addition, various tissue sections from 22 ATC and six PDTC patients were examined concerning PSMA expression. Ga-68-PSMA-PET/CT showed heterogeneous PSMA expression among patients and lesions. Six of the eight analyzed patients (two ATC, four PDTC) showed increased glucose metabolism without increased PSMA uptake after PET/CT. In one patient (PDTC), F-18-FDG-PET/CT tracer uptake was positive and Ga-68-PSMA-PET/CT showed heterogeneous results. Another patient (PDTC) evidenced only PSMA-positive lesions and received two cycles of Lutetium-177 (Lu-177)-PSMA therapy, which kept his disease stable for seven months. There was a correlation between immunohistochemical PSMA expression and uptake on Ga-68-PMSA-PET/CT in three of the examined patients. Twenty-seven of the analyzed 39 ATC and 13 of the analyzed 22 PDTC tissue sections showed a strong PSMA expression. Considering the rarity of PDTC and ATC, which is the reason for the small patient population we studied, the findings of this study confirm the high diagnostic sensitivity and superiority of F-18-FDG-PET/CT in comparison to Ga-68-PSMA-PET/CT in the diagnosis of ATC and PDTC. However, it can be suggested that Ga-68-PMSA-PET/CT can be considered as a beneficial adjunct to the well-established F-18-FDG-PET/CT for a few individual selected patients with ATC and PDTC to detect lesions not discovered by F-18-FDG-PET/CT and to determine patients' eligibility for a radioligand therapy. Radiolabelled PSMA-ligands may, in the future, represent a theranostic approach with only minor side effects for a few individual selected patients with ATC and PDTC who need alternative treatment options in case of progression when established therapies are no longer effective. However, due to the small sample size of our collective, larger studies are needed to allow for a final evaluation on the significance of PSMA-targeted diagnostic and therapy for ATC and PDTC.

Several GRPR antagonists were developed for SPECT and PET imaging of prostate cancer. We previously reported a preclinical evaluation of the GRPR antagonist [Tc-99m]Tc-maSSS-PEG2-RM26 (based on [D-Phe(6), Sta(13), Leu(14)-NH2]BBN(6-14)) which bound to GRPR with high affinity and had a favorable biodistribution profile in tumor-bearing animal models. In this study, we aimed to prepare and test kits for prospective use in an early-phase clinical study. The kits were prepared to allow for a one-pot single-step radiolabeling with technetium-99m pertechnetate. The kit vials were tested for sterility and labeling efficacy. The radiolabeled by using the kit GRPR antagonist was evaluated in vitro for binding specificity to GRPR on PC-3 cells (GRPR-positive). In vivo, the toxicity of the kit constituents was evaluated in rats. The labeling efficacy of the kits stored at 4 degrees C was monitored for 18 months. The biological properties of [Tc-99m]Tc-maSSS-PEG2-RM26, which were obtained after this period, were examined both in vitro and in vivo. The one-pot (gluconic acid, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, stannous chloride, and maSSS-PEG(2)-RM26) single-step radiolabeling with technetium-99m was successful with high radiochemical yields (>97%) and high molar activities (16-24 MBq/nmol). The radiolabeled peptide maintained its binding properties to GRPR. The kit constituents were sterile and non-toxic when tested in living subjects. In conclusion, the prepared kit is considered safe in animal models and can be further evaluated for use in clinics.

First identification, chemical analysis and pharmacological characterization of <i>N</i>-piperidinyl etonitazene (etonitazepipne), a recent addition to the 2-benzylbenzimidazole opioid subclass	ARCHIVES OF TOXICOLOGY			English	Article						New synthetic opioids (NSOs); 2-benzylbenzimidazole 'nitazene' opioids; Activity-based detection; N-piperidinyl etonitazene 'etonitazepipne'; New psychoactive substances (NPS); mu-opioid receptor	UND VERWANDTE HETEROCYCLEN; MORPHINE; SYSTEM	N-Piperidinyl etonitazene ('etonitazepipne') represents a recent addition to the rapidly expanding class of 2-benzylbenzimidazole `nitazene' opioids. Following its first identification in an online-sourced powder and in biological samples from a patient seeking help for detoxification, this report details its in-depth chemical analysis and pharmacological characterization. Analysis of the powder via different techniques (LC-HRMS, GC-MS, UHPLC-DAD, FT-IR) led to the unequivocal identification of N-piperidinyl etonitazene. Furthermore, we report the first activity-based detection and analytical identification of N-piperidinyl etonitazene in authentic samples. LC-HRMS analysis revealed concentrations of 1.21 ng/mL in serum and 0.51 ng/mL in urine, whereas molecular networking enabled the tentative identification of various (potentially active) urinary metabolites. In addition, we determined that the extent of opioid activity present in the patient's serum was equivalent to the in vitro opioid activity exerted by 2.5-10 ng/mL fentanyl or 10-25 ng/mL hydromorphone in serum. Radioligand binding assays in rat brain tissue revealed that the drug binds with high affinity (K-i= 14.3 nM) to the mu-opioid receptor (MOR). Using a MOR-beta-arrestin2 activation assay, we found that N-piperidinyl etonitazene is highly potent (EC50 = 2.49 nM) and efficacious (E-max = 183% versus hydromorphone) in vitro. Pharmacodynamic evaluation in male Sprague Dawley rats showed that N-piperidinyl etonitazene induces opioid-like antinociceptive, cataleptic, and thermic effects, its potency in the hot plate assay (ED50 = 0.0205 mg/kg) being comparable to that of fentanyl (ED50 = 0.0209 mg/kg), and > 190 times higher than that of morphine (ED50 = 3.940 mg/kg). Taken together, our findings indicate that N-piperidinyl etonitazene is a potent opioid with the potential to cause harm in users.

Defining Steric Requirements at CB1 and CB2 Cannabinoid Receptors Using Synthetic Cannabinoid Receptor Agonists 5F-AB-PINACA, 5FADB-PINACA, PX-1, PX-2, NNL-1, and Their Analogues	ACS CHEMICAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cannabinoid; receptor; indole; pharmacology; 5F-ADB; PINACA; PX; NNL	MDMB-CHMICA; PHARMACOLOGICAL EVALUATION; AMB-FUBINACA; CUMYL-PICA; APP-BINACA; IDENTIFICATION; CONSTITUENTS; ACTIVATION; INDAZOLE; INDOLE	: Synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists (SCRAs) are a diverse class of new psychoactive substances (NPS). They commonly comprise N-alkylated indole, indazole, or 7-azaindole scaffolds with amide-linked pendant amino acid groups. To explore the contribution of the amino acid side chain to the cannabinoid pharmacology of SCRA NPS, a systematic library of side chainmodified SCRAs was prepared based on the recent detections of amino acid derivatives 17 (5F-AB-PINACA), 18 (5F-ADBPINACA), 15 (PX-1), 19 (PX-2), and 20 (NNL-1). In vitro binding affinities and functional activities at cannabinoid type 1 and 2 receptors (CB1 and CB2, respectively) were determined for all the library members using radioligand competition experiments and a fluorescence-based membrane potential assay. Binding affinities and functional activities varied widely across compounds (Ki = 0.32 to >10 000 nM, EC50 = 0.24-1259 nM), with several clear structure-activity relationships (SARs) emerging. Affinity and potency at CB1 changed as a function of the heterocyclic core (indazole > indole > 7-azaindole) and the pendant amino acid side chain (tertbutyl > iso-propyl > iso-butyl > benzyl > ethyl > methyl > hydrogen). Ensemble docking at CB1 revealed a clear steric basis for observed SAR trends. Interestingly, although 15 (PX-1) and 19 (PX-2) have been detected in recreational drug markets, they failed to induce centrally CB1-mediated effects (e.g., hypothermia) in mice using radiobiotelemetry. Together, these data provide insights regarding structural contributions to the cannabimimetic profiles of 17 (5F-AB-PINACA), 18 (5F-ADB-PINACA), 15 (PX-1), 19 (PX-2), 20 (NNL-1), and other SCRA NPS.

J	Tschan, VJ; Borgna, F; Schibli, R; Müller, C				Tschan, Viviane J.; Borgna, Francesca; Schibli, Roger; Mueller, Cristina			Impact of the mouse model and molar amount of injected ligand on the tissue distribution profile of PSMA radioligands	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						PSMA ligands; Albumin binder; PC-3 PIP; LNCaP; Molar amount	MEMBRANE ANTIGEN-EXPRESSION; PROSTATE-CANCER; THERAPY; ENDORADIOTHERAPY; PHARMACOKINETICS; BIODISTRIBUTION; EFFICACY	Purpose Various preclinical study designs are described in the literature for the evaluation of PSMA radioligands. In this study, [Lu-177]Lu-Ibu-DAB-PSMA, an albumin-binding radioligand, and [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 were investigated and compared under variable experimental conditions. Methods In vitro cell uptake studies were performed with PC-3 PIP and LNCaP tumor cells using a range of molar concentrations (0.75-500 nM) of both radioligands. Biodistribution and SPECT/CT imaging studies were carried out with the respective tumor mouse models using 0.05 nmol and 1.0 nmol injected ligand per mouse. Results In both tumor cell lines, the uptake of the radioligands was increased when using low molar concentrations of the respective ligand. The observed saturation effect at high ligand concentrations was more pronounced for LNCaP cells that express PSMA at lower levels than for PC-3 PIP cells. At all investigated timepoints, the in vivo uptake of both radioligands was higher in PC-3 PIP tumors than in LNCaP tumors. A low molar amount of injected ligand increased the PC-3 PIP tumor uptake mainly for [Lu-177]Lu-Ibu-DAB-PSMA; however, the molar amount of ligand was relevant for both radioligands when using LNCaP tumors. Renal retention of both radioligands was, however, up to fourfold higher during the first hours after application of a low ligand amount compared to the high ligand amount. Conclusion The results of this preclinical study underline the relevance of the tumor model and applied ligand amount for the characterization of PSMA radioligands. The application of equal preclinical study designs is crucial to allow the comparison of novel radioligands with existing ones and, thus, predict potential advantages of new radioligands in view of a clinical application.

Striatal Dopamine Transporter Function Is Facilitated by Converging Biology of α-Synuclein and Cholesterol	FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						dopamine transporter (DAT); alpha-synuclein (SNCA); cholesteroI; striatum; Parkinson's disease; early stage parkinsonism; dopamine uptake; galactoceramide	CHOLINERGIC INTERNEURONS; MICE LACKING; NEURON LOSS; RELEASE; DYSFUNCTION; TRANSMISSION; CALCIUM; EXPRESSION; CHANNELS; DEFICITS	Striatal dopamine transporters (DAT) powerfully regulate dopamine signaling, and can contribute risk to degeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD). DATs can interact with the neuronal protein alpha-synuclein, which is associated with the etiology and molecular pathology of idiopathic and familial PD. Here, we tested whether DAT function in governing dopamine (DA) uptake and release is modified in a human-alpha-synuclein-overexpressing (SNCA-OVX) transgenic mouse model of early PD. Using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FCV) in ex vivo acute striatal slices to detect DA release, and biochemical assays, we show that several aspects of DAT function are promoted in SNCA-OVX mice. Compared to background control alpha-synuclein-null mice (Snca-null), the SNCA-OVX mice have elevated DA uptake rates, and more pronounced effects of DAT inhibitors on evoked extracellular DA concentrations ([DA](o)) and on short-term plasticity (STP) in DA release, indicating DATs play a greater role in limiting DA release and in driving STP. We found that DAT membrane levels and radioligand binding sites correlated with alpha-synuclein level. Furthermore, DAT function in Snca-null and SNCA-OVX mice could also be promoted by applying cholesterol, and using Tof-SIMS we found genotype-differences in striatal lipids, with lower striatal cholesterol in SNCA-OVX mice. An inhibitor of cholesterol efflux transporter ABCA1 or a cholesterol chelator in SNCA-OVX mice reduced the effects of DAT-inhibitors on evoked [DA](o). Together these data indicate that human alpha-synuclein in a mouse model of PD promotes striatal DAT function, in a manner supported by extracellular cholesterol, suggesting converging biology of alpha-synuclein and cholesterol that regulates DAT function and could impact DA function and PD pathophysiology.

Translocator Protein Distribution Volume Predicts Reduction of Symptoms During Open-Label Trial of Celecoxib in Major Depressive Disorder	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Celecoxib; Gliosis; Major depressive disorder; Positron emission tomography; Translocator protein; Treatment response	DOUBLE-BLIND; PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE; 18 KDA; MEDIATED NEUROTOXICITY; BINDING-AFFINITY; BRAIN; MICROGLIA; RADIOLIGAND; EXPRESSION; DULOXETINE	BACKGROUND: Gliosis is common among neuropsychiatric diseases, but the relationship between gliosis and response to therapeutics targeting effects of gliosis is largely unknown. Translocator protein total distribution volume (TSPO V-T), measured with positron emission tomography, mainly reflects gliosis in neuropsychiatric disease. Here, the primary objective was to determine whether TSPO V-T in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) predicts reduction of depressive symptoms following open-label celecoxib administration in treatment-resistant major depressive disorder. METHODS: A total of 41 subjects with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder underwent one [F-18]FEPPA positron emission tomography scan to measure PFC and ACC TSPO V-T. Open-label oral celecoxib (200 mg, twice daily) was administered for 8 weeks. Change in symptoms was measured with the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). RESULTS: Cumulative mean change in HDRS scores between 0 and 8 weeks of treatment was plotted against PFC and ACC TSPO V-T, showing a significant nonlinear relationship. At low TSPO V-T values, there was no reduction in HDRS scores, but as TSPO V-T values increased, there was a reduction in HDRS scores that then plateaued. This was modeled with a 4-parameter sigmoidal model in which PFC and ACC TSPO V-T accounted for 84% and 92% of the variance, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Celecoxib administration in the presence of gliosis labeled by TSPO V-T is associated with greater reduction of symptoms. Given the predictiveness of TSPO V-T on symptom reduction, this personalized medicine approach of matching a marker of gliosis to medication targeting effects of gliosis should be applied in early development of novel therapeutics, in particular for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder.

Despite the importance of GPCRs in human physiology and pharmacotherapy, little is known about the molecular details of the TIP39-PTH2 interaction. To address this, we utilised the different pharmacological profiles of TIP39 and PTH(1-34) at PTH2 and its related receptor TIP39 being an agonist at the former but an antagonist at the latter, while PTH(1-34) activates both. A total of 23 site-directed mutations of PTH2, in which residues were substituted to the equivalent in PTH1, were made and pharmacologically screened for agonist activity. Follow-up mutations were analysed by radioligand binding and CAMP assays. A model of the TIP39-PTH2 complex was built and analysed using molecular dynamics. Only Tyr318-Ile displayed reduced TIP39 potency, despite having increased PTH(1-34) potency, and further mutagenesis and analysis at this site demonstrated that this was due to reduced TIP39 affinity at Tyr318-Ile (pIC(50) = 6.01 +/- 0.03) compared with wild type (pIC(50) = 7.81 +/- 0.03). The hydroxyl group of the Tyr-318's side chain was shown to be important for TIP39 binding, with the Tyr318-Phe mutant displaying 13-fold lower affinity and 35-fold lower potency compared with wild type. TIP39 truncated by up to 5 residues at the N-terminus was still sensitive to the mutations at Tyr-318, suggesting that it interacts with a region within TIP39(6-39). Molecular modelling and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the selectivity is based on an interaction between the Tyr-318 hydroxyl group with the carboxylate side chain of Asp-7 of the peptide.

Positron emission tomography (PET) allows in vivo detection of brain inflammation with spatial information and opportunities for longitudinal follow-up scanning protocols. Here, we assessed whether molecular imaging of the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) can serve as a biomarker for the development of epilepsy. Therefore, brain uptake of [F-18]GE-180, a highly selective radioligand of TSPO, was investigated in a longitudinal PET study in a chronic rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Analyses revealed that the influence of the epileptogenic insult on [F-18]GE-180 brain uptake was most pronounced in the earlier phase of epileptogenesis. Differences were evident in various brain regions during earlier phases of epileptogenesis with [F-18]GE-180 standardized uptake value enhanced by 2.1 to 2.7fold. In contrast, brain regions exhibiting differences seemed to be more restricted with less pronounced increases of tracer uptake by 1.8-2.5fold four weeks following status epilepticus and by 1.5-1.8fold in the chronic phase. Based on correlation analysis, we were able to identify regions with a predictive value showing a correlation with seizure development. These regions include the amygdala as well as a cluster of brain areas. This cluster comprises parts of different brain regions, e. g. the hippocampus, parietal cortex, thalamus, and somatosensory cortex. In conclusion, the data provide evidence that [F-18]GE-180 PET brain imaging can serve as a biomarker of epileptogenesis. The identification of brain regions with predictive value might facilitate the development of preventive concepts as well as the early assessment of the interventional success. Future studies are necessary to further confirm the predictivity of the approach.

The sigma-2 receptor as a therapeutic target for drug delivery in triple negative breast cancer	BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Triple-negative breast cancer; Sigma-2; Targeted therapy; Drug delivery	OVARIAN-CANCER; LIGAND; SMAC; PROLIFERATION; SUBTYPES; TUMORS; PATTERNS; ANALOGS; PROTEIN; PGRMC1	Background: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is associated with high relapse rates and increased mortality when compared with other breast cancer subtypes. In contrast to receptor positive breast cancers, there are no approved targeted therapies for TNBC. Identifying biomarkers for TNBC is of high importance for the advancement of patient care. The sigma-2 receptor has been shown to be overexpressed in triple negative breast cancer in vivo and has been characterized as a marker of proliferation. The aim of the present study was to define the sigma-2 receptor as a target for therapeutic drug delivery and biomarker in TNBC. Methods: Three TNBC cell lines were evaluated: MDA-MB-231, HCC1937 and HCC1806. Sigma-2 compounds were tested for pharmacological properties specific to the sigma-2 receptor through competitive inhibition assays. Sigma-2 receptor expression was measured through radioligand receptor saturation studies. Drug sensitivity for taxol was compared to a sigma-2 targeting compound conjugated to a cytotoxic payload, SW IV-134. Cell viability was assessed after treatments for 2 or 48 h. Sigma-2 blockade was assessed to define sigma-2 mediated cytotoxicity of SW IV-134. Caspase 3/7 activation induced by SW IV-134 was measured at corresponding treatment time points. Results: SW IV-134 was the most potent compound tested in two of the three cell lines and was similarly effective in all three. MDA-MB-231 displayed a statistically significant higher sigma-2 receptor expression and also was the most sensitive cell line evaluated to SW IV-134. Conclusion: Targeting the sigma-2 receptor with a cytotoxic payload was effective in all the three cell lines evaluated and provides the proof of concept for future development of a therapeutic platform for the treatment of TNBC.

Moreover, several pharmacological tests were carried out to assess whether they reveal other than alpha(1)-adrenoceptor blocking properties such as: antagonistic for 5-HT2 receptors, vasorelaxant or spasmolytic. Methods: The influence on alpha(1A)-adrenoceptors was examined in biofunctional studies employing isolated rat vas deferens, on alpha(1B)-adrenoceptors in guinea-pig spleen, on alpha(1D)-adrenoceptors in rat aorta, and on alpha(1L)-adrenoceptors in rabbit spleen. Affinity for 5-HT2 receptors was measured in radioligand binding assay, whereas antagonistic potency for 5-HT2 receptors was studied on isolated rat aorta. Vasorelaxant effect of tested compounds was assessed in functional study employing rat aorta, whereas direct spasmolytic activity was investigated using the isolated rabbit small intestine. Results: The present study provides evidences that the tested 2-methoxyphenylpiperazine xanthone derivatives are non-selective alpha(1)-adrenoceptor blockers. However, at higher concentrations the direct spasmolytic effect could enhance their hypotensive activity. The obtained results indicate that the studied xanthones possessed weak calcium entry blocking activity, as well as antagonistic properties for 5-HT2A receptors. Conclusions: The results of the present study support the idea that the hypotensive activity of the studied compounds is related to their alpha(1)-adrenolytic properties.

We recently identified alpha 4 beta delta GABA(A) receptors as possible high affinity GHB targets. GABA(A) receptors are highly sensitive to allosteric modulation. Thus to investigate whether GHB high-affinity binding sites are also sensitive to allosteric modulation, we screened both known GABA(A) receptor ligands and a library of natural compounds in the rat cortical membrane GHB specific high-affinity [H-3]NCS-382 binding assay. Two hits were identified: Monastrol, a positive allosteric modulator of GABA function at delta-containing GABA(A) receptors, and the naturally occurring flavonoid catechin. These compounds increased [H-3]NCS-382 binding to 185-272% in high micromolar concentrations. Monastrol and (+)-catechin significantly reduced [H-3]NCS-382 dissociation rates and induced conformational changes in the binding site, demonstrating a positive allosteric modulation of radioligand binding. Surprisingly, binding of [H-3]GHB and the GHB high-affinity site-specific-radioligands [I-125]BnOPh-GHB and [H-3]HOCPCA was either decreased or only weakly increased, indicating that the observed modulation was critically probe-dependent. Both monastrol and (+)-catechin were agonists at recombinant alpha 4 beta 3 delta receptors expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. When monastrol and GHB were co-applied no changes were seen compared to the individual responses. In summary, we have identified the compounds monastrol and catechin as the first allosteric modulators of GHB high-affinity binding sites. Despite their relatively weak affinity, these compounds may aid in further characterization of the GHB high-affinity sites that are likely to represent certain GABA(A) receptors.

Elevated brain cannabinoid CB<sub>1</sub> receptor availability in post-traumatic stress disorder: a positron emission tomography study	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						brain imaging; cannabinoid receptors; OMAR; PET; PTSD	CHRONIC UNPREDICTABLE STRESS; ENDOCANNABINOID SYSTEM; TRAUMA EXPOSURE; IN-VIVO; MEMORY; PTSD; DEPRESSION; AMYGDALA; BINDING; RATS	Endocannabinoids and their attending cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor have been implicated in animal models of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, their specific role has not been studied in people with PTSD. Herein, we present an in vivo imaging study using positron emission tomography (PET) and the CB1-selective radioligand [C-11] OMAR in individuals with PTSD, and healthy controls with lifetime histories of trauma (trauma-exposed controls (TC)) and those without such histories (healthy controls (HC)). Untreated individuals with PTSD (N=25) with non-combat trauma histories, and TC (N=12) and HC (N=23) participated in a magnetic resonance imaging scan and a resting PET scan with the CB1 receptor antagonist radiotracer [C-11] OMAR, which measures the volume of distribution (V-T) linearly related to CB1 receptor availability. Peripheral levels of anandamide, 2-arachidonoylglycerol, oleoylethanolamide, palmitoylethanolamide and cortisol were also assessed. In the PTSD group, relative to the HC and TC groups, we found elevated brain-wide [C-11] OMAR V-T values (F(2,53) 7.96, P=0.001; 19.5% and 14.5% higher, respectively), which were most pronounced in women (F(1,53) 5.52, P=0.023). Anandamide concentrations were reduced in the PTSD relative to the TC (53.1% lower) and HC (58.2% lower) groups. Cortisol levels were lower in the PTSD and TC groups relative to the HC group. Three biomarkers examined collectively-OMAR V-T, anandamide and cortisol-correctly classified nearly 85% of PTSD cases. These results suggest that abnormal CB1 receptor-mediated anandamide signaling is implicated in the etiology of PTSD, and provide a promising neurobiological model to develop novel, evidence-based pharmacotherapies for this disorder.

In the present study we have used primary cultures of human detrusor smooth muscle cells (HDSMCs), in order to investigate the role of muscarinic receptors in HDSMC proliferation. Samples were obtained as discarded tissue from men >65 years undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer and cut in pieces that were either immediately frozen or placed in culture medium for the cell culture establishment. HDSMCs were isolated from samples, propagated and maintained in culture. [H-3]-QNB radioligand binding on biopsies revealed the presence of muscarinic receptors, with a K-d of 0.10 +/- 0.02 nM and a B-max, of 72.8 +/- 0.1 fmol/mg protein. The relative expression of muscarinic receptor subtypes, based on Q-RT-PCR, was similar in biopsies and HDSMC with a rank order of M-2 >= M-3 >= M-1 > M-4 > M-5. The cholinergic agonist carbachol (CCh, 1-100 mu M) concentration-dependently increased [H-3]-thymidine incorporation (up to 46 +/- 4%). This was concentration-dependently inhibited by the general muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine and by subtype-preferring antagonists with an order of potency of darifenacin >4-DAMP >AF-DX 116. The CCh-induced cell proliferation was blocked by selective PI-3 kinase and ERK activation inhibitors, strongly suggesting that these intracellular pathways mediate, at least in part, the muscarinic receptor-mediated cell proliferation. This work shows that M2 and M3 receptors can mediate not only HDSM contraction but also proliferation; they may also contribute bladder remodelling including detrusor hypertrophy.

Effect of chronic activation of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors on 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors functional activity and expression of key genes of the brain serotonin system	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Brain 5-HT3, 5-HT1A, 5HT(2A) serotonin receptors; Receptors functional activity; Expression of the 5-HT3, 5-HT1A, 5HT(2A), 5-HTT, TPH-2 genes	RAT; AFFINITY; RADIOLIGAND; MODULATION; NEURONS; ASSAY; PCR	Among serotonin (5-HT) receptors, the 5-HT3 receptor is the only ligand-gated ion-channel. Little is known about the interaction between the 5-HT3 receptor and other 5-HT receptors and influence of 5-HT3 chronic activation on other 5-HT receptors and the expression of key genes of 5-HT system. Chronic activation of 5-HT3 receptor with intracerebroventricularly administrated selective agonist 1-(3-chlorophenyl)biguanide hydrochloride (m-CPBG) (14 days, 40 nmol, i.c.v.) produced significant desensitization of 5-HT3 and 5-HT1A receptors. The hypothermic responses produced by acute administration of selective agonist of 5-HT3 receptor (m-CPBG, 40 nmol, i.c.v.) or selective agonist of 5-HT1A receptor (8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin)(8-OH-DPAT, 1 mg/kg, i.p.) was significantly lower in m-CPBG treated mice compared with the mice of control groups. Chronic m-CPBG administration failed to induce any significant change in the 5-HT2A receptor functional activity and in the expression of the gene encoding 5-HT2A receptor. Chronic activation of 5-HT3 receptor produced no considerable effect on the expression on 5-HT3, 5-HT1A, and 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) and tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (TPH-2) genes - the key genes of brain 5-HT system, in the midbrain, frontal cortex and hippocampus. In conclusion, chronic activation of ionotropic 5-HT3 receptor produced significant desensitization of 5-HT3 and postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors but caused no considerable changes in the expression of key genes of the brain 5-HT system.

We have developed and validated a new analytical procedure for the plasma metabolite analysis of PET radioligands based on micellar liquid chromatography using an anionic surfactant mobile phase. Chromatographic separation was performed on an octadecyl semipreparative column (10 mm I.D. x 160 mm, 10 mu m) using 100 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 1-butanol in 10 mM sodium-phosphate (pH 7.2) at a flow rate of 5 mL/min. The samples taken from monkey or human plasma during PET measurements were directly injected into a liquid chromatographic (LC) system coupled to an online radiometric detector under micellar conditions using 1-2% (v/v) 1-butanol mobile phase to remove plasma proteins and concentrate the analytes at the column head. At 2 mm, mobile phase was changed to elute and separate PET radioligand and its radiometabolites with high peak capacity under high submicellar conditions (10-25% 1-butanol). This procedure allowed direct plasma injection (up to 2 mL) into the LC column without any pretreatment with a short analysis-time of 8-10 mm. Satisfactory reproducibility, linearity, sensitivity, accuracy and recovery were obtained in the validation study. The developed method was successfully applied to study the metabolism for diverse groups of PET radioligands and provided reliable determination of PET radioligands in human and monkey plasma. This method is advantageous in terms of simplifying and shortening the processes required to analyze short-lived radioligands as well as in providing a more accurate estimation of the metabolite corrected input function, especially for the radioligands with lower recoveries or degradation potential during the deproteination process in a conventional procedure.

A pharmacokinetic PET study of NK<sub>1</sub> receptor occupancy	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						Positron emission tomography; Pharmacokinetics; NK1 receptors; Kinetic modelling; Population approach	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; SUBSTANCE-P RECEPTORS; HUMAN BRAIN; MODEL; BINDING; ANTAGONIST; RADIOLIGANDS; APREPITANT; CASOPITANT; GR205171	Purpose There is growing recognition of the importance of integrating drug occupancy data acquired by positron emission tomography (PET) with the plasma pharmacokinetics of the drug, in order to establish proper dose selection in subsequent clinical trials. Here we present a study in human subjects of the occupancy of NK1 receptors achieved following different doses of casopitant, a selective NK1 antagonist. Methods Two PET scans were carried out in each of eight human subjects, with the PET radioligand [C-11]GR205171, a high-affinity and selective NK1 receptor antagonist. The first scan was under baseline conditions and the second 24 h after a single oral dose of casopitant (2-120 mg). Arterial blood was collected throughout the scans for determination of plasma and whole blood input functions. Venous blood samples were taken prior to and following oral dosing up to 24 h for a pharmacokinetic study of casopitant concentration in plasma. Results It was first necessary to establish a suitable kinetic model for the estimation of [C-11]GR205171 NK1 receptor binding parameters in human brain tissue. A three-tissue compartment model with simultaneous estimation of multiple regions sharing common variables across regions was found suitable for the analysis. Because of the injected cold mass of the tracer and the high affinity of [C-11]GR205171 a correction for tracer occupancy effects was also incorporated into the analysis. We then developed a pharmacokinetic-receptor occupancy (PK-RO) model of the relationship between casopitant plasma concentrations and receptor binding, using a population approach. Conclusion These results indicate that after chronic dosing, casopitant can achieve a degree of NK1 receptor occupancy higher than those that have previously been tested in studies of clinical depression.

Autoantibody to ZnT8 (ZnT8A) was detected in up to 80% of patients with new-onset T1D and 26% of patients with T1D otherwise classified as negative on the basis of existing markers. As no data of ZnT8A in Chinese have been reported, we aim to evaluate the utility of ZnT8A for diagnosis of autoimmune T1D in Chinese relative to other autoantibody markers. Methods Radioligand binding assays were performed on 539 T1D sera using human ZnT8 carboxyterminal 325Arg construct or a dimer incorporating 325Arg and 325Trp alongside antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADA) or insulinoma-associated protein 2 (IA-2A). The antigenic specificity was analysed in the context of clinical characteristics of the patients. Results ZnT8A were present in 24.1% (130 of 539) of patients with T1D versus 1.8% (10 of 555; P < 0.001) in type 2 diabetes. At diagnosis, ZnT8A and IA-2A were less prevalent in Chinese subjects with T1D than in Caucasian populations (both P < 0.001) but similar to Japanese. The diagnostic sensitivity of combined GADA, IA-2A and ZnT8A measurements reached 65.5% with ZnT8A detected in 13.5% (29 of 215) of GADA and/or IA-2A-negative subjects. ZnT8A prevalence was lower in older and fatter patients. ZnT8A+ alone patients were distinguished from Ab- ones (P < 0.05-0.001) on the basis of higher insulin requirement and lower systolic blood pressure level. Conclusion ZnT8A is an independent marker for T1D in Chinese and combined with GADA and IA-2A enhances diagnostic sensitivity. ZnT8A may be associated with different clinical phenotypes than GADA or IA-2A. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Today, endothelin (ET)-1 receptor antagonists were proved to be effective in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. Aiming at developing new endothelin-A receptor (ETA) antagonist for treatment of pulmonary hypertension, di-n -butylaminocarbamyl-L-leucyl-D-tryptophanyl-D-4-chloro-Phe, named GF063, was synthesized at base of selective ETA receptor antagonist BQ485 and selected for the further pharmacological characterization. The preliminary pharmacodynamics of GF063 was evaluated by radioligand receptor binding assay and test of antivasoconstriction effects in vitro and in vivo. The integrative pharmacodynamics was evaluated in hypoxia-induced rat pulmonary hypertension. In vitro, GF063 bound to ETA receptor with 100,000-fold higher affinity than to ETB receptor. GF063 concentration dependently inhibited contraction of isolated rat aortic ring induced by ET-1 and shifted the cumulative concentration-contraction response curve to right with no change in the maximal response. In vivo, GF063 inhibited the increase of mean systemic arterial pressure induced by ET-1 in anesthetized rat. In hypoxia-induced rat pulmonary hypertension model, pretreatment with GF063 (40 mg/kg, s.c.) significantly decreased pulmonary artery pressure and right ventricular hypertrophy, also significantly inhibited the increase of ET-1 level in lung, improved hemodynamics, and alleviated the wall thickness of pulmonary vessels. This study indicated that GF063, as a selective ETA receptor antagonist, could inhibit vasoconstriction effects in vivo and in vitro, could prevent pulmonary hypertension induced by hypoxia, and may have great potential to be developed as a new drug of antipulmonary hypertension.

Biodistribution and dosimetry in humans of two inverse agonists to image cannabinoid CB<sub>1</sub> receptors using positron emission tomography	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						C-11-MePPEP; F-18-FMPEP-d(2); Dosimetry; PET	RADIATION-DOSIMETRY; ENDOCANNABINOIDS; RADIOLIGAND; EXPRESSION; SYSTEM; TARGET	Cannabinoid subtype 1 (CB1) receptors are found in nearly every organ in the body, may be involved in several neuropsychiatric and metabolic disorders, and are therefore an active target for pharmacotherapy and biomarker development. We recently reported brain imaging of CB1 receptors with two PET radioligands: C-11-MePPEP and F-18-FMPEP-d (2). Here we describe the biodistribution and dosimetry estimates for these two radioligands. Seven healthy subjects (four men and three women) underwent whole-body PET scans for 120 min after injection with C-11-MePPEP. Another seven healthy subjects (two men and five women) underwent whole-body PET scans for 300 min after injection with F-18-FMPEP-d (2). Residence times were acquired from regions of interest drawn on tomographic images of visually identifiable organs for both radioligands and from radioactivity excreted in urine for F-18-FMPEP-d (2). The effective doses of C-11-MePPEP and F-18-FMPEP-d (2) are 4.6 and 19.7 mu Sv/MBq, respectively. Both radioligands demonstrated high uptake of radioactivity in liver, lung, and brain shortly after injection and accumulated radioactivity in bone marrow towards the end of the scan. After injection of C-11-MePPEP, radioactivity apparently underwent hepatobiliary excretion only, while radioactivity from F-18-FMPEP-d (2) showed both hepatobiliary and urinary excretion. C-11-MePPEP and F-18-FMPEP-d (2) yield an effective dose similar to other PET radioligands labeled with either C-11 or F-18. The high uptake in brain confirms the utility of these two radioligands to image CB1 receptors in brain, and both may also be useful to image CB1 receptors in the periphery.

Main methods: Muscarinic receptor occupancy in the rat brain after the intravenous (i.v.) injection of oxybutynin, darifenacin and imidafenacin was evaluated by using a small animal PET system, and compared with the results by ex vivo autoradiographic and ex vivo radioligand binding experiments. Key findings: In PET study, the i.v. injection of oxybutynin but not darifenacin or imidafenacin at pharmacological doses decreased significantly binding potential (BP) of (+)N-[C-11]methyl-3-piperidyl benzilate ([C-11](+)3-MPB) in the rat cerebral cortex and corpus striatum in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, in the in vivo autoradiographic experiment, oxybutynin dose-dependently reduced binding of [C-11] (+)3-MPB in the brain, whereas darifenacin and imidafenacin did not. Following the i.v. injection of oxybutynin, darifenacin and imidafenacin, there was a similar degree of binding to muscarinic receptors in the bladder as demonstrated by a significant increase in apparent dissociation constant (K-d) values for specific [N-methyl-H-3]scopolamine methyl chloride ([H-3]NMS) binding. Significant binding of muscarinic receptors in the brain was observed after the injection of oxybutynin but not darifenacin or imidafenacin. Significance: Oxybutynin but not darifenacin or imidafenacin has potential side effects on the central nervous system (CNS) in patients with OAB. The results reveal the noninvasive characterization of brain receptor occupancy by PET to be a powerful tool for precise evaluation of adverse CNS effects of antimuscarinic agents in pre-clinical and clinical evaluations.

Chronic intermittent hypobaric hypoxia decreases beta-adrenoceptor activity in right ventricular papillary muscle. Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol 298: H1267-H1272, 2010. First published January 22, 2010; doi: 10.1152/ajpheart.00410.2009.Chronic intermittent hypobaric hypoxia (CIHH) has an effective cardiac protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury. However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully known. It has been shown that blockade of beta-adrenergic receptor exerts anti-arrhythmic action and improves cardiac remodeling in ischemic myocardium. Thus we determined the influence of CIHH on beta-adrenergic receptor activity in right ventricular papillary muscle of rats. We found that the action potential duration in right ventricular papillary muscle was significantly longer in CIHH rats than in control rats. Activation of beta-adrenergic receptor with DL-isoproterenol dose-dependently increased action potential duration and the contractility in right ventricular papillary muscle. In CIHH rats, the prolonged effect of DL-isoproterenol on action potential duration and the positive inotropic effect were significantly decreased compared with that in control rats. Furthermore, radioligand-binding experiments revealed that the density and affinity of beta-adrenergic receptor in right ventricular myocardium was significantly lower in CIHH rats. In addition, Western blot analysis revealed that the membrane-bound G protein G(s)alpha expression level in cardiac myocardium was significantly lower in CIHH rats than that in control rats. Collectively, these data suggest that CIHH suppresses beta-adrenergic receptor action in right ventricular papillary muscle through decreasing receptor density and affinity, as well as membrane-bound G(s)alpha. This mechanism may be involved in the cardiac protective effect of CIHH.

Coupling of β2-Adrenoceptors to XLα<sub>s</sub> and Gα<sub>s</sub>: A New Insight into Ligand-Induced G Protein Activation	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							XL-ALPHA-S; SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION; SPLICE VARIANTS; RECEPTOR ACTIVITY; GNAS GENE; SUBUNIT; MODEL; CYCLASE; LONG	G alpha(s) and extra-large G alpha(s) (XL alpha(s)) can both transduce receptor activation into intracellular cAMP generation. It is unknown, however, whether these two GNAS-locus products display distinct properties with respect to receptor coupling. Here, we show that XL alpha(s) couples to the beta 2-adrenoceptor more efficiently than G alpha(s). In transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts null for both G alpha(s) and XL alpha(s) (2B2 cells), basal cAMP accumulation mediated by XL alpha(s) was higher than that mediated by G alpha(s). Inverse agonist treatment reduced G alpha(s)-mediated basal activity, whereas its effect was markedly blunted on XL alpha(s)-mediated basal activity. Rank order of ligand efficacies regarding cAMP accumulation was the same when the receptor was coupled to XL alpha(s) or G alpha(s). However, ligand-induced and XL alpha(s)-mediated cAMP generation was higher than that mediated by G alpha(s). The relatively high efficiency of XL alpha(s)-mediated cAMP generation was conditional, disappearing with increased level of receptor expression or increased efficacy of ligand. Full-agonist responses in XL alpha(s)- and G alpha(s)-expressing cells were comparable even at low receptor levels, whereas partial agonist responses became comparable only when the receptor expression was increased (>3 pmol/mg). Radioligand binding studies showed that the high-affinity component in agonist binding to beta 2-adrenoceptor was more pronounced in cells expressing XL alpha(s) than those expressing G alpha(s). We discuss these findings in the framework of current receptor-G protein activation models and offer an extended ternary complex model that can fully explain our observations.	[Kaya, A.

In the Current Study we performed an exemplary application of a virtual parallel screening approach to identify potential targets for 16 secondary metabolites isolated and identified from the aerial parts of the medicinal plant Ruta graveolens L. Low energy conformers of the isolated constituents were simultaneously screened against a set of 2208 pharmacophore models generated in-house for the in silico prediction of putative biological targets, i.e., target fishing, Based on the predicted ligand-target interactions, we focused on three biological targets, namely acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the human rhinovirus (HRV) coat protein and the cannabinoid receptor type-2 (CB2). For a critical evaluation of the applied parallel screening approach, virtual hits and non-hits were assayed on the respective targets. For AChE the highest scoring virtual hit, arborinine, showed the best inhibitory in vitro activity on AChE (IC50 34.7 mu M). Determination of the anti-HRV-2 effect revealed 6,7,8-trimethoxycoumarin and arborinine to be the most active antiviral constituents with IC50 values of 11.98 mu M and 3.19 mu M, respectively. Of these, arborinine was predicted virtually. Of all the molecules subjected to parallel screening, one virtual CB2 ligand was obtained, i.e., rutamarin. Interestingly, in experimental Studies only this compound showed a selective activity to the CB2 receptor (Ki of 7.4 mu M) by using a radioligand displacement assay. The applied parallel screening paradigm with constituents of R. graveolens on three different proteins has shown promise as an in silico tool for rational target fishing and pharmacological profiling of extracts and single chemical entities in natural product research.

Defining the roles of Asn-128, Glu-129 and Phe-130 in loop A of the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor	MOLECULAR MEMBRANE BIOLOGY			English	Article						serotonin receptor; ligand-gated ion channel; ionotropic receptor; binding site; aromatic amino acid; 5-HT3 receptor	NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR; LIGAND-BINDING; EXTRACELLULAR DOMAIN; AGONIST-BINDING; SITE; RESIDUES; MUTAGENESIS; ANTAGONISTS; CA2+	The ligand binding pocket of Cys-loop receptors consists of a number of binding loops termed A-F. Here we examine the 5-HT3 receptor loop A residues Asn-128, Glu-129 and Phe-130 using modelling, mutagenesis, radioligand binding and functional studies on HEK 293 cells. Replacement of Asn-128 results in receptors that have wild type [H-3]granisetron binding characteristics but large changes (ranging from a five-fold decrease to a 1500-fold increase) in the 5-HT EC50 when compared to wild type receptors. Phe-130 mutant receptors show both increases and decreases in K-d and EC50 values, depending on the amino acid substituted. The most critical of these residues appears to be Glu-129; its replacement with a range of other amino acids results in non-binding and non-functional receptors. Lack of binding and function in some, but not all, of these receptors is due to poor membrane expression. These data suggest that Glu-129 is important primarily for receptor expression, although it may also play a role in ligand binding; Phe-130 is important for both ligand binding and receptor function, and Asn-128 plays a larger role in receptor function than ligand binding. In light of these results, we have created two new homology models of the 5-HT3 receptor, with alternative positions of loop A. In our preferred model Glu-129 and Phe-130 contribute to the binding site, while the location of Asn-128 immediately behind the binding pocket could contribute to the conformation changes that result in receptor gating. This study provides a new model of the 5-HT3 receptor binding pocket, and also highlights the importance of experimental data to support modelling studies.

Serum adiponectin, an adipokine with anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitising properties, has been shown to be lower in patients with gestational diabetes mellitus, a state of greater insulin resistance than normal pregnancies. Hypothesising that the human placenta is a source of adiponectin, we investigated its expression and secretion, and the regulation by cytokines of adiponectin and its receptors. Methods: Real-time RT-PCR, radioimmunoassay, Western blotting, radioligand binding and immunofluorescent analyses were applied to demonstrate the expression, secretion and functionality of placental adiponectin. Results: Adiponectin gene expression and protein were found in the human term placenta, with expression primarily in the syncytiotrophoblast. RIA of conditioned media from explant experiments revealed that the placenta can secrete adiponectin in vitro. Addition of conditioned media to HEK-293 cells transfected with the gene for adiponectin receptor-1 (ADIPOR1) altered the phosphorylation status of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, an effect abolished after preabsorption with adiponectin antibody. Cytokines, including TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-6 and leptin, differentially modulated placental adiponectin receptors as well as adiponectin gene expression and secretion. Interestingly, in placentae from women with gestational diabetes mellitus, we observed significant downregulation of adiponectin mRNA, significant upregulation of ADIPOR1 expression, and a non-significant increase in ADIPOR2 expression. Conclusions/interpretation: Our results indicate that the human placenta produces and secretes adiponectin, and that adiponectin and its receptors are differentially regulated by cytokines and their expression altered in women with gestational diabetes mellitus. Collectively, our novel data suggest that adiponectin may play a role in adapting energy metabolism at the materno-fetal interface.

J	Dumont, Y; Moyse, E; Fournier, A; Quirion, R				Dumont, Y; Moyse, E; Fournier, A; Quirion, R			Evidence for the existence of an additional class of neuropeptide Y receptor sites in rat brain	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							HIGH-AFFINITY RADIOLIGAND; PANCREATIC-POLYPEPTIDE RECEPTORS; PEPTIDE YY; FOOD-INTAKE; Y-5 RECEPTOR; IN-VITRO; ANTAGONIST; POTENT; SUBTYPES; AGONIST	Five distinct neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptors have been cloned thus far. Selective agonists and antagonists have recently been developed allowing for detailed functional studies as to the pathophysiological role of a given subtype as well as receptor binding characteristics and distribution. To precisely investigate the discrete localization and ligand selectivity profile of Y-4 and Y-5 receptors, a series of selective molecules were used as radioligands and competitors in rat brain tissues. Binding data revealed that Y-4 and Y-5 receptor-related agonists and antagonists competed with high affinity for specific I-125-[Leu(31), Pro(34)]human peptide YY (hPYY) binding in the presence of BIBO3304 [(R)-N-[[4-(aminocarbonylaminomethyl)-phenyl]methyl]-N-2-(diphenylacetyl)-argininamide trifluoroacetate] to mask Y-1 sites as well as specific I-125-labeled human pancreatic polypeptide (hPP) binding. Competition binding profiles were best fitted to a two-site model for both radioligands, suggesting the likely recognition of the Y-4 and Y-5 subtypes. We were surprised to find that the visualization of these specific binding sites by receptor autoradiography clearly revealed the distinct distribution of specific I-125-[Leu(31), Pro(34)]hPYY (in presence of Y-1 and Y-5 blockers) and I-125-hPP (in presence of Y-5 blocker) binding sites. Moreover, significant amounts of specific I-125-hPP binding were observed in the medial preoptic area, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, interpeduncular nucleus, and various brainstem nuclei, even after masking Y-4 and Y-5 receptors. Similar results were obtained using I-125-hPYY(3-36) in presence of Y-2 and Y-5 blockers. These results suggest the possible existence of at least one additional subtype of NPY receptor sites in the rat brain, with enrichment seen in midbrain and brainstem areas involved in the regulation of food intake and cardiorespiratory parameters.

J	Dean, B; Scarr, E; McLeod, M				Dean, B; Scarr, E; McLeod, M			Changes in hippocampal GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunit composition in bipolar 1 disorder	MOLECULAR BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						schizophrenia; hippocampus; postmortem; GABA(A) receptor; human	BENZODIAZEPINE BINDING-SITE; ALPHA-5 SUBUNIT; MESSENGER-RNA; BRAIN; SUBTYPE; CEREBELLUM; EXPRESSION; LINKAGE; BETA-3; CORTEX	Postmortem CNS studies have suggested an uncoupling of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and benzodiazepine binding sites on the hippocampal GABA(A) receptor in schizophrenia. The GABA(A) receptor is an assembly of discrete subunits that form a ligand-gated ion channel, the binding characteristics of which are defined by receptor subunit composition. Thus, a likely explanation for an uncoupling between the GABA and benzodiazepine binding sites on the GABAA receptor would be a change in receptor subunit composition. To test this hypothesis we measured the density of GABA ([H-3]muscimol) and benzodiazepine ([H-3]flumazenil) binding sites on the GABAA receptor in hippocampi, obtained postmortem, from schizophrenic, bipolar I disorder and control subjects. In addition, we measured the amount of [H-3]flumazenil binding that could be displaced with zolpidem and clonazeparn. Levels of both [H-3]muscimol and [H-3]flumazenil binding were significantly decreased in part of the CA2 from subjects with schizophrenia; the decrease in [H-3]flumazenil being due to decreases in both zolpidem-sensitive and -insensitive radioligand binding. There were complex regionally specific changes in [H-3]muscimol binding in the hippocampus from subjects with bipolar I disorder but there were no significant changes in the overall levels of [H-3]flumazenil binding. There were significant decreases in zolpidem-sensitive and increases in zolpidcm-insensitiv [H-3]flumazenil binding in most regions of the sections of the hippocampal formation studied in bipolar I disorder. Unlike [H-3]flumazenil, zolpidem does not bind to the alpha 5 subunit of the GABAA receptor; therefore, we postulate that there is an increase in GABAA receptors containing alpha 5 subunit in the hippocampus from subjects with bipolar I disorder.

J	Chen, SR; Pan, HL				Chen, SR; Pan, HL			Antinociceptive effect of morphine, but not μ opioid receptor number, is attenuated in the spinal cord of diabetic rats	ANESTHESIOLOGY			English	Article							ROOT GANGLION NEURONS; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; STREPTOZOCIN; COMPONENTS; ANALGESIA; MEMBRANES; EFFICACY; PROTEIN; CELLS; MODEL	Background: The mechanisms of decreased analgesic potency of mu opioids in diabetic neuropathic pain are not fully known. The authors recently found that G protein activation stimulated by the mu opioid agonist is significantly reduced in the spinal cord dorsal horn in diabetes. in the current study, they determined potential changes in the number and binding affinity of mu opioid receptors in the spinal cord in diabetic rats. Methods: Rats were rendered diabetic with an intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. The nociceptive withdrawal threshold was measured before and after intrathecal injection of morphine by applying a noxious pressure stimulus to the hind paw. The mu opioid receptor was determined with immunocytochemistry labeling and a specific mu opioid receptor radioligand, [H-3]-(D-Ala(2),N-Me-Phe(4), Gly-ol(5))-enkephalin ([H-3]-DAMGO), in the dorsal spinal cord obtained from age-matched normal and diabetic rats 4 weeks after streptozotocin treatment. Results: The antinociceptive effect of intrathecal morphine (2-10 mug) was significantly reduced in diabetic rats, with an ED50 about twofold higher than that in normal rats. However, both the dissociation constant (3.99 +/- 0.22 vs. 4.01 +/- 0.23 nm) and the maximal specific binding (352.78 +/- 37.26 vs. 346.88 +/- 35.23 fmol/mg protein) of [H-3]-DAMGO spinal membrane bindings were not significantly different between normal and diabetic rats. The mu opioid receptor immunoreactivity in the spinal cord dorsal horn also was similar in normal and diabetic rats. Conclusions: The reduced analgesic effect of intrathecal morphine in diabetes is probably due to impairment of mu opioid receptor-G protein coupling rather than reduction in mu opioid receptor number in the spinal cord dorsal horn.

This family of closely related analogs exerts a spectrum of effects, ranging from positive to negative allosteric modulation, and includes compounds that do not themselves modulate mGluR5 agonist activity but rather prevent other family members from exerting their modulatory effects. 3,3'- Difluorobenzaldazine (DFB) has no agonist activity, but it acts as a selective positive allosteric modulator of human and rat mGluR5. DFB potentiates threshold responses to glutamate, quisqualate, and 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine in fluorometric Ca2+ assays 3- to 6-fold, with EC50 values in the 2 to 5 muM range, and at 10 to 100 muM, it shifts mGluR5 agonist concentration-response curves approximately 2-fold to the left. The analog 3,3'-dimethoxybenzaldazine (DMeOB) acts as a negative modulator of mGluR5 agonist activity, with an IC50 of 3 muM in fluorometric Ca2+ assays, whereas the analog 3,3'-dichlorobenzaldazine (DCB) does not exert any apparent modulatory effect on mGluR5 activity. However, DCB seems to act as an allosteric ligand with neutral cooperativity, preventing the positive allosteric modulation of mGluRs by DFB as well as the negative modulatory effect of DMeOB. None of these analogs affects binding of [H-3] quisqualate to the orthosteric ( glutamate) site, but they do inhibit [H-3] 3-methoxy-5-(2-pyridinylethynyl) pyridine binding to the site for 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine, a previously identified negative allosteric modulator. With the use of these compounds, we provide evidence that allosteric sites on GPCRs can respond to closely related ligands with a range of pharmacological activities from positive to negative modulation as well as to neutral competition of this modulation.

We here describe a monoclonal antibody (mAb), 137-26, that binds to the C5a moiety of human C5 and neutralizes the effects of C5a without interfering with C5 cleavage and the subsequent formation of lytic C5b-9 complex. Mouse anti-human CS mAbs were generated and the reactivity with C5 and C5a was detected by ELISA and surface plasmon resonance. The inhibition of C5a binding to C5a receptor was studied using a radioligand binding assay. The effects of the antibody on C5a functions were examined using isolated neutrophils and a novel human whole blood model of inflammation. Haemolytic assays were used to study the effect on complement-mediated lysis. mAb 137-26 reacted with both solid- and solution-phase C5 and C5a in a dose-dependent manner with high affinity. The antibody competed C5a binding to C5a receptor and inhibited C5a-mediated chemotaxis of neutrophils. Furthermore, the antibody effectively abrogated complement-dependent E. coli-induced CD11b up-regulation and oxidative burst in neutrophils of human whole blood. mAb 137-26 was more potent than a C5a receptor antagonist and a previously described anti-C5a antibody. mAb 137-26 did not inhibit complement-mediated lysis, nor did it activate complement itself. Together, mAb 137-26 binds both the C5a moiety of native C5 and free C5a, thereby effectively neutralizing the biological effects of C5a. The antibody may have therapeutic potential in inflammatory diseases where C5a inhibition combined with an operative lytic pathway of C5b-9 is particularly desired.

Nicotinic receptors were identified with the frog toxin epibatidine (EB) that binds with high affinity to a variety of receptors containing alpha and beta subunits. Rat pups were exposed to Pb from their mothers given 750-ppm Pb in the diet beginning on gestational day 0 through postnatal day (PN)21. Blood Pb levels ranged from 36.5 to 46.5 mug/dl in the PN21 pups, and this exposure did not alter their body weight when compared to control rats. Several brain regions identified by autoradiographic studies as having significant binding of EB were dissected from control and Pb-treated pups and used in saturation-binding experiments with membrane preparations to determine the affinity constant (K-d) and maximal-binding capacity (B-max) of [H-3]EB. Results indicate that the B-max of [H-3]EB was increased in several brain regions in Pb-treated rat pups, without a significant effect on K-d estimates. [H-3]EB-binding to membranes from untreated rats was not affected by in vitro exposure to 20-muM Pb, indicating that the effect of Ph on [H-3]EB-binding in vivo was not likely due to direct influence of free Ph remaining in the tissue at the time of assay. The data therefore suggest that expression of nicotinic receptors that bind [H-3]EB were increased by developmental exposure to Pb. Several possible mechanisms for these effects and the potential toxicological significance are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was to image p and 6 opioid receptors in the human heart using positron emission tomography (PET). Five subjects (three females, two males, 65 +/- 8 years old) underwent PET scanning of the chest with [C-11]carfentanil ([C-11]CFN) and [C-11]-N-methyl-naltrindole ([C-11]MeNTI) and the images were analyzed for evidence of opioid receptor binding in the heart. Either [C-11]CFN or [C-11]MeNTI (20 mCi) was injected i.v. with subsequent dynamic acquisitions over 90 min. For the blocking studies, either 0.2 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg of naloxone was injected i.v. 5 min prior to the injection of [C-11]CFN and [C-11]MeNTI, respectively. Regions of interest were placed over the left ventricle, left ventricular chamber, lung and skeletal muscle. Graphical analysis demonstrated average baseline myocardial binding potentials (BP) of 4.37 +/- 0.91 with [C-11]CFN and 3.86 +/- 0.60 with [C-11]MeNTI. Administration of 0.2 mg/kg naloxone prior to [C-11]CFN produced a 25% reduction in BP in one subject in comparison with baseline values, and a 19% decrease in myocardial distribution volume (DV). Administration of 1 mg/kg of naloxone before [C-11]MeNTI in another subject produced a 14% decrease in BP and a 21% decrease in the myocardial DV. These results demonstrate the ability to image these receptors in vivo by PET. PET imaging of cardiac opioid receptors may help to better understand their role in cardiovascular pathophysiology and the effect of abuse of opioids and drugs on heart function.

At a concentration of 30 nM [H-3]L-AP4, no specific binding was detected in membranes expressing the group I receptors mGluR1a or mGluR5a, or in membranes expressing the group II mGluRs, mGluR2 and mGluR3. Among the group III mGluRs, specific [H-3]L-AP4 binding was detected in cells expressing mGluR4a and mGluR8a but not in cells expressing mGluR6 or mGluR7a. The binding of [H-3]CPPG showed an exceptional pattern of selectivity amongst the mGluR subtypes; at a concentration of 20 nM [H-3]CPPG, a high level of specific binding was seen in membranes containing mGluR8a but not in any of the other mGluR subtypes. The affinity constant (K-D) calculated for [H-3]CPPG binding to mGluR8a was 183 nM. In competition experiments, the phosphono-substituted phenylglycine congeners including MPPG, (RS)-PPG, and unlabeled CPPG were the most potent inhibitors of [H-3]CPPG binding while non-phosphonated compounds such as L-glutamate and MCPG were substantially less potent. These results demonstrate that [H-3]L-AP4 and [H-3]CPPG can be used as probes to selectively label group III mGluRs and that CPPG and related phenylglycine derivatives are useful for studying differences in the ligand recognition sites of highly homologous mGluRs.

Synaptic loss in many neurodegenerative diseases can be visualized by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A). However, the use of SV2A PET for studying synaptic changes during aging is not particularly explored. Thus, in the present study, PET ligand [18F]SynVesT-1, which binds to SV2A, was used to investigate synaptic density at different ages in healthy mice. Wild type C57BL/6 mice divided into three age groups (4-5 months ( n = 7), 12-14 months ( n = 11), 17- 19 months ( n = 7)) were PET scanned with [18F]SynVesT-1. Brain retention of [18F]SynVesT-1 expressed as the volume of distribution (VIDIF) was calculated using an image-derived input function. Estimates of VIDIF were derived using either a one-tissue compartment model (1TCM), a two-tissue compartment model (2TCM), or the Logan plot with blood input to find the best-fit model for [18F]SynVesT-1. After the PET scans, tissue sections were immunostained for the detection of SV2A and neuronal markers. We found that [18F]SynVesT-1 data acquired 60 min post intravenously injection and analyzed with 1TCM described the brain pharmacokinetics of the radioligand in mice well. [18F]SynVesT-1 brain retention was lower in the oldest group of mice, indicating a decrease in synaptic density in this age group. However, no gradual age dependent decrease in synaptic density at a region-specific level was observed. Immunostaining indicated that SV2A expression and neuron numbers were similar across all three age groups. In general, these data obtained in healthy aging mice are consistent with previous findings in humans where synaptic density appeared stable during aging up to a certain age, after which a small decrease is observed.

Therefore, we investigated the presence of leukoencephalopathy after multiagent chemotherapy in women treated for breast cancer and potential underlying neuroinflammatory processes. Methods: In this exploratory study, 15 chemotherapy-treated and 15 age-matched chemotherapy-naive patients with early-stage breast cancer, as well as 15 healthy controls underwent simultaneous PET-MR neuroimaging, including T1-weighted MPRAGE, T2-weighted FLAIR and dynamic PET with the 18-kDA translocator protein (TSPO) radioligand [F-18]DPA-714. Total and regional (juxtacortical, periventricular, deep white matter and infratentorial) lesion burden were compared between the groups with one-way ANOVA. With paired t-tests, [F-18] DPA-714 volume of distribution [V-T, including partial volume correction (PVC)] in lesioned and normal appearing white matter (NAWM) were compared within subjects, to investigate inflammation. Finally, two general linear models were used to examine the predictive values of neurofilament light-chain (NfL) serum levels on (1) total lesion burden or (2) PVC [F-18]DPA-714 V-T of lesions showing elevated inflammation. Results: No significant differences were found in total or localized lesion burden. However, significantly higher (20-45%) TSPO uptake was observed in juxtacortical lesions (p <= 0.008, t >= 3.90) compared to NAWM in both cancer groups, but only persisted for chemotherapy-treated patients after PVC (p = 0.005, t = 4.30). NfL serum levels were not associated with total lesion volume or tracer uptake in juxtacortical lesions. Conclusion: This multimodal neuroimaging study suggests that neuroinflammatory processes could be involved in the development of juxtacortical, but not periventricular or deep white matter, leukoencephalopathy shortly after chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer.

Existing studies evaluating the prognostic potential of PSMA (prostate-specific membrane antigen) for PCa were performed on radical prostatectomy specimens (RPE), i.e., decision making for disease management was already completed at time of sample analysis. Aim of our study was to assess the prognostic value of PSMA expression for PCa patients on biopsies at time of initial diagnosis. Methods: PSMA expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry on 294 prostate biopsies with corresponding RPE, 621 primary tumor foci from 242 RPE, 43 locally advanced or recurrent tumors, 34 lymph node metastases, 78 distant metastases and 52 benign prostatic samples. PSMA expression was correlated with clinico-pathologic features. Primary endpoint was recurrence free survival. Other clinicopathologic features included WHO/ISUP grade groups, PSA serum level, TNM-stage, and R-status. Chi-square test, ANOVA-analyses, Cox-regression, and log-rank tests were performed for statistical analyses. Results: High PSMA expression on both biopsy and RPE significantly associates with a higher risk of disease recurrence following curative surgery. The 5-year-recurrence free survival rates were 88.2, 74.2, 67.7 and 26.8% for patients exhibiting no, low, medium, or high PSMA expression on biopsy, respectively. High PSMA expression on biopsy was significant in multivariate analysis predicting a 4-fold increased risk of disease recurrence independently from established prognostic markers. PSMA significantly increases during PCa progression. Conclusion: PSMA is an independent prognostic marker on biopsies at time of initial diagnosis and can predict disease recurrence following curative therapy for PCa. Our study proposes the application of the routinely used IHC marker PSMA for outcome prediction and decision making in risk-adapted PCa management on biopsies at time of initial diagnosis.

Synthesis and Evaluation of a Novel <SUP>64</SUP>Cu- and <SUP>67</SUP>Ga-Labeled Neurokinin 1 Receptor Antagonist for <i>in Vivo</i> Targeting of NK1R-Positive Tumor Xenografts	BIOCONJUGATE CHEMISTRY			English	Article							SUBSTANCE-P; NK1 RECEPTOR; EXPRESSION; GROWTH; VITRO; PET	Neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R) is expressed in gliomas and neuroendocrine malignancies and represents a promising target for molecular imaging and targeted radionuclide therapy. The goal of this study was to synthesize and evaluate a novel NK1R ligand (NK1R-NOTA) for targeting NK1R-expressing tumors. Using a carboxymethyl moiety linked to L-733060 as a starting reagent, NK1R-NOTA was synthesized in a three-step reaction and then labeled with Cu-64 (or Ga-67 for in vitro studies) in the presence of CH3COONH4 buffer. The radioligand affinity and cellular uptake were evaluated with NK1R-transduced HEK293 cells (HEK293-NK1R) and NK1R nontransduced HEK293 cells (HEK293-WT) and their xenografts. Radiolabeled NK1R-NOTA was obtained with a radiochemical purity of >95% and specific activities of >7.0 GBq/mu mol for Cu-64 and >5.0 GBq/mu mol for Ga-67. Both Cu-64- and Ga-67-labeled NK1R-NOTA demonstrated high levels of uptake in HEK293-NK1R cells, whereas co-incubation with an excess of NK1R ligand L-733060 reduced the level of uptake by 90%. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging showed that [Cu-64]NK1R-NOTA had a accumulated rapidly in HEK293-NK1R xenografts and a 10-fold lower level of uptake in HEK293-WT xenografts. Radioactivity was cleared by gastrointestinal tract and urinary systems. Biodistribution studies confirmed that the tumor-to-organ ratios were >= 5 for all studied organs at 1 h p.i., except kidneys, liver, and intestine, and that the tumor-to-intestine and tumor-to-kidney ratios were also improved 4 and 20 h post-injection. [Cu-64]NK1R-NOTA is a promising ligand for PET imaging of NK1R-expressing tumor xenografts. Delayed imaging with [Cu-64]NK1R-NOTA improves image contrast because of the continuous clearance of radioactivity from normal organs.

A positron emission tomography replication study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ASSOCIATION	Background Associations between dopamine receptor levels and pro- and antisocial behavior have previously been demonstrated in human subjects using positron emission tomography (PET) and self-rated measures of personality traits. So far, only one study has focused on the dopamine D1-receptor (D-1-R), finding a positive correlation with the trait social desirability, which is characterized by low dominant and high affiliative behavior, while physical aggression showed a negative correlation. The aim of the present study was to replicate these previous findings using a new independent sample of subjects. Materials and methods Twenty-six healthy males were examined with the radioligand [C-11]SCH-23390, and completed the Swedish universities Scales of Personality (SSP) which includes measures of social desirability and physical trait aggression. The simplified reference tissue model with cerebellum as reference region was used to calculate BPND values in the whole striatum and limbic striatum. The two regions were selected since they showed strong association between D-I-R availability and personality scores in the previous study. Pearson's correlation coefficients and replication Bayes factors were then employed to assess the replicability and robustness of previous results. Results There were no significant correlations (all p values >0.3) between regional BPND values and personality scale scores. Replication Bayes factors showed strong to moderate evidence in favor no relationship between Dl-receptor availability and social desirability (striatum BF01 = 12.4; limbic striatum BF01 = 7.2) or physical aggression scale scores (limbic striatum BF01 = 3.3), compared to the original correlations. Discussion We could not replicate the previous findings of associations between D1-R availability and either pro- or antisocial behavior as measured using the SSP. Rather, there was evidence in favor of failed replications of associations between BPND and scale scores. Potential reasons for these results are restrictive variance in both PET and personality outcomes due to high sample homogeneity, or that the previous findings were false positives.

Gefitinib also induces differentiation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines and patient samples lacking EGFR by an unknown mechanism. Here we dissected the mechanism of gefitinib action responsible for its EGFR-independent effects. Methods: Signaling events were analyzed by homogenous time-resolved fluorescence and immunoblotting. Cellular proliferation and differentiation were assessed by ATP measurement, trypan blue exclusion, 5-bromo-2'deoxyuridine incorporation and flow-cytometry. Gefitinib and G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) interactions were assessed by beta-arrestin recruitment, luciferase and radioligand competition assays. Role of histamine receptors (HR) in gefitinib actions were assessed by HR knockdown or pharmacological modulation. EGFR and HR interaction was assessed by co-immunoprecipitation. Results: Gefitinib reduced cyclic AMP content in both AML and EGFR-expressing cells and induced ERR phosphorylation in AML cells. Dibutyryl-cAMP or PD98059 suppressed gefitinib-induced AML cell cytostasis and differentiation. Gefitinib bound to and modulated HRs with subtype selectivity. Pharmacological or genetic modulations of H2 and H4 HRs (H2R and H4R) not only suppressed gefitinib-induced cytostasis and differentiation of AML cells but also blocked EGFR and ERK1/2 inhibition in MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, in MDA-MB-231 cells gefitinib enhanced EGFR interaction with H4R that was blocked by H4R agonist 4-methyl histamine (4MH). Conclusion: HRs play critical roles in anti-cancer effects of gefitinib in both EGFR-deficient and EGFR-rich environments. General significance: We furnish fresh insights into gefitinib functions which may provide new molecular clues to its efficacy and safety issues. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

FK886 potently inhibited the binding of [I-125]Bolton-Hunter-labeled substance P ([I-125]BH-SP; 100pM) to human NK1 receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (IC50=0.70nm). It also possessed high affinities for dog, ferret, gerbil and guinea pig NK1 receptors, but not for rat NK1 receptor. FK886 was highly selective for the NK1 receptor, with 250- and >20000-fold selectivity for human NK1 over NK2 and NK3, respectively. Further, it did not inhibit radioligand binding at 54 different sites, including receptors, ion channels and transporters. FK886 inhibited substance P (3.2 nM)-induced inositol phosphate formation in human NK1 receptor-expressing CHO cells (IC50=1.4nM) without stimulating NK1 receptors. The antagonism exerted by FK886 against human NK1 receptor was insurmountable in saturation binding experiments, with both the affinity and B-max of [I-125]BH-SP being significantly reduced. After intravenous administration, FK886 (0.01-0.1 mg/kg) dose-dependently inhibited the foot-tapping behavior induced by intracerebroventricular administration of a selective NK1 receptor agonist, GR73632 (10pmol), in gerbils, with significant inhibition being observed at doses of 0.032-0.1 mg/kg, indicating excellent brain penetration. The brain penetration of FK886 was further demonstrated by the cerebral distribution of radioactivity after intravenous injection of radiolabeled FK886. Taken together, these results demonstrate that FK886 is a potent, highly selective and centrally active, insurmountable antagonist of the NK1 receptor, and suggest that FK886 antagonizes various NK1 receptor-mediated biological effects in the central nervous system.

Antiarrhythmic peptide AAP10 (H-Gly-Ala-Gly-Hyp-Pro-Tyr-CONH2) has been shown to prevent acidosis-induced uncoupling and ischemia-related increase in dispersion. Previous structure-effect investigations and subsequent computer modeling studies indicated that the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine may exert similar effects as AAP10. We assessed the binding of C-14-AAP10 to membranes of rabbit cardiac ventricles and its displacement with desipramine in a classical radioligand binding and competition study. Gap junction currents were measured between isolated pairs of human atrial cardiomyocytes under normal and acidotic (pH 6.3) conditions with or without 1 mu mol/l desipramine using dual whole-cell voltage clamp. The effect of 1 mu mol/l desipramine was assessed in isolated rabbit hearts (Langendorff technique) undergoing local ischemia by coronary occlusion with 256-channel electrophysiological mapping and subsequent analysis of connexin43 (Cx43) expression, phosphorylation (Western blot), and subcellular localization (immunohistology). We found saturable C-14-AAP10 binding to cardiac membranes (K (D), 0.29 +/- 0.11 nmol/l; B (max), 42.5 +/- 7.2 pmol/mg) which could be displaced by desipramine with a K (D.High) = 0.14 mu mol/l and a K (D.Low) = 22 mu mol/l. Acidosis reduced the gap junction conductance in human cardiomyocyte pairs from 24.1 +/- 4.7 to 11.5 +/- 2.5 nS, which could be significantly reversed by desipramine (26.6 +/- 4.8 nS). In isolated hearts, ischemia resulted in significantly increased dispersion of activation-recovery intervals, loss of membrane Cx43, and dephosphorylation of Cx43, which all could be prevented by desipramine. Desipramine seems to prevent the uncoupling of cardiac gap junctions and ischemia-related increase in dispersion.

Identification of Membrane-bound Variant of Metalloendopeptidase Neurolysin (EC 3.4.24.16) as the Non-angiotensin Type 1 (Non-AT1), Non-AT<sub>2</sub> Angiotensin Binding Site	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							AMINO-ACID-SEQUENCE; THIMET OLIGOPEPTIDASE; RAT-BRAIN; CONVERTING-ENZYME; BIOCHEMICAL-CHARACTERIZATION; SUBCELLULAR-DISTRIBUTION; TISSUE DISTRIBUTION; ENDOPEPTIDASE 24.15; MOLECULAR-CLONING; AT(1) RECEPTOR	Recently, we discovered a novel non-angiotensin type 1 (non-AT(1)), non-AT(2) angiotensin binding site in rodent and human brain membranes, which is distinctly different from angiotensin receptors and key proteases processing angiotensins. It is hypothesized to be a new member of the renin-angiotensin system. This study was designed to isolate and identify this novel angiotensin binding site. An angiotensin analog, photoaffinity probe I-125-SBpa-Ang II, was used to specifically label the non-AT(1), non-AT(2) angiotensin binding site in mouse forebrain membranes, followed by a two-step purification procedure based on the molecular size and isoelectric point of the photo-radiolabeled binding protein. Purified samples were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry identification of proteins in the two-dimensional gel sections containing radioactivity. LC-MS/MS analysis revealed eight protein candidates, of which the four most abundant were immunoprecipitated after photoradiolabeling. Immunoprecipitation studies indicated that the angiotensin binding site might be the membrane-bound variant of metalloendopeptidase neurolysin (EC 3.4.24.16). To verify these observations, radioligand binding and photoradiolabeling experiments were conducted in membrane preparations of HEK293 cells overexpressing mouse neurolysin or thimet oligopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.15), a closely related metalloendopeptidase of the same family. These experiments also identified neurolysin as the non-AT(1), non-AT(2) angiotensin binding site. Finally, brain membranes of mice lacking neurolysin were nearly devoid of the non-AT(1), non-AT(2) angiotensin binding site, further establishing membrane-bound neurolysin as the binding site. Future studies will focus on the functional significance of this highly specific, high affinity interaction between neurolysin and angiotensins.

Quantification of the neurokinin 1 receptor ligand [<SUP>11</SUP>C]R116301	NUCLEAR MEDICINE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						[C-11]R116301; neurokinin 1 receptor; positron emission tomography; test-retest; tracer kinetic model	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; SUBSTANCE-P RECEPTORS; NK1 RECEPTORS; HUMAN BRAIN; IN-VIVO; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; IMAGE REGISTRATION; PET; MODEL; IDENTIFICATION	Purpose Neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors have been implicated in depression, anxiety, and pain perception. Recently, it was shown that, in the human brain, a specific NK1 receptor-related signal was obtained with the novel radioligand, [C-11]R116301, using positron emission tomography. The purpose of this study was to evaluate various methods for quantifying specific [C-11]R116301 binding. Methods Two dynamic 90-min [C-11]R116301 scans, separated by 5 h, were performed in 11 healthy volunteers. In three patients, the second scan was performed after an oral blocking dose of 125 mg of aprepitant, whereas in the other eight, no intervention was performed (test-retest). Whole striatum was used as the tissue of interest, as it has the highest density of NK1 receptors. Cerebellum was used as the reference tissue. Results Reference tissue models were stable with the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) performing best. Average (+/- standard deviation) SRTM-derived mean nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) of all (first) baseline scans was 0.64 +/- 0.31 (n=11), which reduced to -0.01 +/- 0.03 (n=3) after aprepitant administration. Test-retest results showed low variability (14.0 +/- 10.7%) and excellent reliability, as indicated by the intraclass correlation coefficient (0.93). The ratio of standardized uptake values of striatum and cerebellum minus 1, an approximation of BPND, showed very low variability (6.2 +/- 3.1%) with excellent reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient=0.98), and correlated well with SRTM-derived BPND (R-2 = 0.96). Conclusion SRTM is the model of choice for quantifying [C-11]R116301 binding. Semiquantitative tissue ratios hold promise for routine clinical applications.

THE EFFECT OF Δ<SUP>9</SUP>-TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL ON 5-HT<sub>3</sub> RECEPTORS DEPENDS ON THE CURRENT DENSITY	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol; cannabinoid; 5-HT3A receptor; Xenopus oocytes; nodose ganglion neuron.	MEDIATED ION CURRENT; CANNABINOID AGONISTS; SUBUNIT-A; INHIBITION; ANANDAMIDE; RESPONSES; CHANNELS; NEURONS; INTERNEURONS; HIPPOCAMPUS	The effects of :Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive component of cannabis, on the function of 5-HT type 3 (5-HT3) receptors were investigated using a two-electrode voltage clamp technique in Xenopus oocytes, and a whole-cell patch clamp technique in rat nodose ganglion neurons. In oocytes injected with 3 ng cRNA of 5-HT3A receptor, THC reversibly inhibited currents evoked with 5-HT (1 mu M) in a concentration-dependent manner (IC50=1.2 mu M). The extent of THC inhibition was inversely correlated with the amount of cRNA injected and the mean 5-HT3A receptor current densities. Pretreatment with actinomycin D, which inhibits transcription, decreased the mean 5-HT3 receptor current density and increased the extent of THC inhibition on 5-HT3 receptor-mediated currents. The IC50 values for THC increased from 285 nM to 1.2 mu M in oocytes injected with 1 and 3 ng of 5-HT3A cRNA, respectively. In radioligand binding studies on membrane preparations of oocytes expressing 5-HT3A receptors, THC did not alter the specific binding of a 5-HT3A receptor antagonist, [H-3]GR65630. In the presence of 1 mu M THC, the maximum 5-HT-induced response was also inhibited without a significant change in 5-HT potency, indicating that THC acts as a noncompetitive antagonist on 5-HT3 receptors. In adult rat nodose ganglion neurons, application of 1 mu M THC caused a significant inhibition of 5-HT3 receptors, extent of which correlated with the density of 5-HT-induced currents, indicating that the observed THC effects occur in mammalian neurons. The inhibition of 5-HT3 receptors by THC may contribute to its pharmacological actions in nociception and emesis. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of IBRO.

Close examination of the interaction between these systems may offer insights into the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders and depression to understand how stress and these disorders are related. In this study, we investigated the relationship between plasma levels of cortisol and the dominant inhibitory serotonergic receptor, serotonin-1A (5-HT1A). Using positron emission tomography (PET) and the radioligand [carbonyl-C-11] WAY-100635, we quantified the 5-HT1A receptor binding. Data from 12 male patients with social phobia and 18 matched control subjects were analysed. Seven brain regions were investigated: the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices, hippocampus, amygdala, medial orbitofrontal and retrosplenial cortices, and dorsal raphe nucleus. Partial correlation analysis, controlled for age and radiochemical variables, was performed to demonstrate the association between cortisol plasma levels and 5-HT1A receptor binding. Cortisol plasma levels were significantly lower in patients with social phobia compared to healthy controls. Moreover, we found strong negative correlations between cortisol plasma levels and 5-HT1A binding in the amygdala (r=-0.93, p=0.0004), hippocampus (r=-0.80, p=0.009), and retrosplenial cortex (r=-0.48, p=0.04) in patients with social phobia. Within the former two regions, these associations were significantly higher in patients than in healthy controls. This PET study confirms a negative association between plasma cortisol levels and the 5-HT1A receptor distribution consistent with studies in rodents and non-human primates. Dysregulation of the cortisol level might increase the vulnerability for mood disorders by altering limbic 5-HT1A receptors.

[C-11]-(+)-PHNO is a radiolabeled D-2 and D-3 agonist, suitable for imaging the agonist binding sites (denoted D-2HIGH and D-3) of these receptors with positron emission tomography (PET). PET studies in nonhuman primates documented that, in vivo, [ C-11]-(+)-PHNO displays a relative selectivity for D-3 compared with D-2HIGH receptor sites and that the [C-11]-(+)-PHNO signal is enriched in D-3 contribution compared with conventional ligands such as [C-11] raclopride. Methods: To define the D-3 contribution (f(PHNO)(D3)) to [C-11]-(+)-PHNO binding potential (BPND) in healthy humans, 52 PET scans were obtained in 19 healthy volunteers at baseline and following oral administration of various doses of the selective D-3 receptor antagonist, GSK598809. Results: The impact of GSK598809 on [C-11]-(+)-PHNO was regionally selective. In dorsal regions of the striatum, GSK598809 did not significantly affect [C-11]-(+)-PHNO BPND (f(PHNO)(D3) approximate to 0%). Conversely, in the substantia nigra, GSK598809 dose-dependently reduced [C-11]-(+)-PHNO binding to nonspecific level (f(PHNO)(D3) approximate to 100%). In ventral striatum (VST), globus pallidus and thalamus (THA), [C-11]-(+)-PHNO BPND was attributable to a combination of D-2HIGH and D-3 receptor sites, with f(PHNO)(D3) of 26%, 67% and 46%, respectively. D-3 receptor binding potential (BPNDD3) was highest in globus pallidus (1.90) and substantial nigra (1.39), with lower levels in VST (.77) and THA (.18) and negligible levels in dorsal striatum. Conclusions: This study elucidated the pharmacologic nature of the [C-11]-(+)-PHNO signal in healthy subjects and provided the first quantification of D-3 receptor availability with PET in the living human brain.

AF-353, a novel, potent and orally bioavailable P2X3/P2X2/3 receptor antagonist	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						P2X; purinergic; ATP; ion channel; antagonist; urinary bladder	CHRONIC CONSTRICTION INJURY; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; P2X(3) RECEPTOR; SENSORY NEURONS; P2X(2/3) RECEPTORS; TNP-ATP; SMALL-INTESTINE; RAT; A-317491; MICE	Background and purpose: Purinoceptors containing the P2X3 subunit (P2X3 homotrimeric and P2X2/3 heterotrimeric) are members of the P2X family of ion channels gated by ATP and may participate in primary afferent sensitization in a variety of pain-related diseases. The current work describes the in vitro pharmacological characteristics of AF-353, a novel, orally bioavailable, highly potent and selective P2X3/P2X2/3 receptor antagonist. Experimental approach: The antagonistic potencies (pIC(50)) of AF-353 for rat and human P2X3 and human P2X2/3 receptors were determined using methods of radioligand binding, intracellular calcium flux and whole cell voltage-clamp electrophysiology. Key results: The pIC(50) estimates for these receptors ranged from 7.3 to 8.5, while concentrations 300-fold higher had little or no effect on other P2X channels or on an assortment of receptors, enzymes and transporter proteins. In contrast to A-317491 and TNP-ATP, competition binding and intracellular calcium flux experiments suggested that AF-353 inhibits activation by ATP in a non-competitive fashion. Favourable pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in rat, with good oral bioavailability (%F = 32.9), reasonable half-life (t(1/2) = 1.63 h) and plasma-free fraction (98.2% protein bound). Conclusions and implications: The combination of a favourable pharmacokinetic profile with the antagonist potency and selectivity for P2X3 and P2X2/3 receptors suggests that AF-353 is an excellent in vivo tool compound for study of these channels in animal models and demonstrates the feasibility of identifying and optimizing molecules into potential clinical candidates, and, ultimately, into a novel class of therapeutics for the treatment of pain-related disorders.

The protonation constants of both ligands were determined by H-1 NMR titration and by potentiometry at 25.0 degrees C in 0.10 M ionic strength in KNO3. The latter method was also used to ascertain the stability constants of their copper(II) complexes. These studies showed that the CuL1 complex has a much lower thermodynamic stability than the CuL2, and the H(2)L2 displays an excellent affinity for copper(II), due to the good fit of copper(II) into its cavity. The copper complexes of the novel ligands were characterized by electronic spectroscopy in solution and by crystal X-ray diffraction. These studies indicated that the copper center in the CuL1 complex adopts a square-pyramidal geometry with the four nitrogen atoms of the macrocycle forming the equatorial plane and a water molecule at axial position, and the copper in the CuL2 complex is square-planar. Several labeling conditions were tested, and only H(2)L2 could be labeled with Cu-67 efficiently (> 98%) in mild conditions (39 degrees C, 15 min) to provide a slightly hydrophilic radioligand (log D = -0.19 +/- 0.03 at pH 7.4). The in vitro stability was studied in the presence of different buffers or with an excess of diethylenetriamine-pentaethanoic acid. Very high stability was shown under these conditions for over 5 days. The incubation of the radiocopper complex in human serum showed 6% protein binding.

Pharmacokinetics of [<SUP>18</SUP>F]fluoroalkyl derivatives of dihydrotetrabenazine in rat and monkey brain	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						vesicular monoamine transporter; tomography; emission computed; tetrabenazine	VESICULAR MONOAMINE TRANSPORTER; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; IN-VIVO MEASURES; CELL MASS; BINDING; DISEASE; PET; RADIOLIGANDS; INNERVATION; TERMINALS	The specific binding and regional brain pharmacokinetics of new fluorine-18 ([F-18])-labeled radioligands for the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) were examined in the rat and primate brain. In the rat, 9-[F-18]fluoropropyl-(+/-)-9-O-desinethyidihydrotetrabenazine ([F-18]FP-(+/-)-DTBZ) showed better specific binding in the striatum than either (+)-[C-11]dihydrotetrabenazine ((+)-[C-11]DTBZ) or 9-[F-18]fluoroethyl-(+/-)-9-O-desmethyidihydrotetrabenazine ([F-18]FE-(+/-)-DTBZ). Using microPET, the regional brain pharmacokinetics of [(FIFE)-F-18-(+/-)-DTBZ, [F-18]FP-(+/-)-DTBZ and (+)-[C-11]DTBZ were examined in the same monkey brain. (+)-['C-11]DTBZ and [F-18]FP-(+/-)DTBZ showed similar brain uptakes and pharmacokinetics, with similar maximum striatum-to-cerebellum ratios (STR/CBL=5.24 and 5.15, respectively) that were significantly better than obtained for [F-18]FE-(+/-)-DTBZ (STR/C13L=2.55). Striatal distribution volume ratios calculated using Logan plot analysis confirmed the better specific binding for the fluoropropyl compound [distribution volume ratio (DVR)-3.32] vs. the fluoroethyl compound (DVR=2.37). Using the resolved single active isomer of the fluoropropyl compound, [18 F]FP(+)-DTBZ, even better specific to nonspecific distribution was obtained, yielding the highest distribution volume ratio (DVR=6.2) yet obtained for a VMAT2 ligand in any species. The binding of [F-18]FP-(+)-DTBZ to the VMAT2 was shown to be reversible by administration of a competing dose of unlabeled tetrabenazine. Metabolic defluorination was slow and minor for the [F-18]fluoroalkyl-DTBZ ligands. The characteristics of high specific binding ratio, reversibility, metabolic stability and longer half-life of the radionuclide make [F-18]FP-(+)-DTBZ a promising alternative VMAT2 radioligand suitable for widespread use in human positron emission tomography studies of monoaminergic innervation of the brain.

The different signaling pathways involved in the autoantibody's actions, Were characterized. As previously reported serum autoantibodies from schizophrenic patients reacted against neural cells surface inhibiting the binding of the specific mAChR radioligand to rat cerebral frontal cortex membrane. Moreover, by ELISA using M-1 synthetic peptide (with identical aminoacid sequence to human M-1 mAChR) as coating antigen we demonstrated the reactivity against the second extracellular loop of human cerebral M-1 mAChR. The corresponding affinity-purified anti M-1 peptide IgG (anti M-1 peptide IgG) from schizophrenic patients by stimulation of M-1 mAChR exerted an increase in m, mAChR-mRNA and nNOS-mRNA levels, that significantly con-elated with the accumulation of phosphoinositides (IPs) and activation of NOS (alpha = 0.05). All these effects were blunted by pirenzepine and mimicked the action of the authentic agonist. Concurrent analysis of the effects of nNOS, phospholipase C (PLC) and calcium/calmodulin (CaM) inhibition on both, m(1) mAChR-mRNA and nNOS-mRNA levels, showing that antibody up-regulation mRNA level is under the control of endogenous nitric oxide (NO) signaling system. On the basis of our results, the activation of M-1 mAChR by schizophrenic autoantibody appears to induce nNOS-mRNA expression and reciprocally, the activation of NOS upregulates rut mAChR gene expression. These results gave support to the participation of an autoimmune process in a particular group of chronic schizophrenic patients. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Mukherjee, S; Saha, A; Roy, K				Mukherjee, S; Saha, A; Roy, K			QSAR of estrogen receptor modulators:: exploring selectivity requirements for ERα versus ERβ binding of tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives using E-state and physicochemical parameters	BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article						QSAR; SERM; E-state index; physicochemical parameters; tetrahdroisoquinoline derivatives; selectivity	ELECTROTOPOLOGICAL-STATE; MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY; COX-1 BINDING; INDEX; MECHANISMS; TOXICITY; LIGANDS; SERMS	Considering importance of developing selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), the present paper explores selectivity requirements of tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives for binding with ERalpha versus ERbeta receptors using E-state index and physicochemical parameters. The best model [n = 21, Q(2) = 0.512, R-a(2) = 0.613, R = 0.819, F = 11.6 (df 3, 17)] for ERalpha binding data obtained from radioligand binding assay showed importance of C-1, C-15 and lipophilicity (logP) while the best model [n = 21, Q(2) = 0.768, R-a(2) = 0.796, R = 0.904, F = 40.1 (df 2, 18)] for ERbeta binding data showed importance of C-1 and molar refractivity (MR). While modeling ERalpha/ERbeta selectivity [n = 21, Q(2) = 0.695, R-a(2) = 0.739, R = 0.882, F = 19.8 (df 3, 17)], C-1, C-15 and molar refractivity were found to be significant contributors. The data obtained from cellular transcription assay were also modeled. In case of ERalpha, the best equation involving E-state values of C-1 and C-14 and logP explained 62.1% of the variance while the best equation for ERbeta involving E-state values of C-1 and C-15 and MR explained 64.6% of the variance of the response variable. In case of ERalpha/ERbeta selectivity, the best equation involving E-state values of O-8, C-14 and N-27 showed 48.3% explained variance, which increased to 63.5% on deletion of single outlier. From the analysis it appears that the nitrogen atom of the aminoethoxyphenyl substituent and 6-hydroxy substituent of the tetrahydroisoquinoline nucleus play important roles for ERalpha/ERbeta selectivity in addition to R-1 and R-2 substituents.

We have speculated that preferential occupancy may be clinically important for the purported actions of pindolol in accelerating the antidepressant effects of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs). In this study, we have examined the preferential occupancy by pindolol of 5-HT1A autoreceptors, following three different pindolol regimes (10 mg single dose, 2.5 mg t.i.d., and 5 mg t.i.d., in 15 depressed patients on SSRIs. In addition, seven healthy volunteers were examined following a single 10 mg dose of pindolol. We found a preferential occupancy of 22.6 +/- 7.7% following a single dose of 10 mg of pindolol, in the healthy volunteers, which was attenuated in depressed patients on the same dose of pindolol to 2.9 +/- 10.8% ( Student's t = 3.94, df = 12, p = 0.002). In addition, we found a significant negative correlation between the degree of preferential occupancy and the severity of depression as assessed by the Hamilton depression rating score ( HAM-D), Spearman's rho = - 0.728, N = 14, p = 0.003, in the depressed sample. A possible mechanism underlying preferential occupancy and the attenuation of this phenomenon in depressed patients on SSRIs may include changes in the proportion of high affinity 5-HT1A sites in the autoreceptor region of the midbrain raphe. Speculatively, the degree of preferential occupancy may serve as a surrogate marker for depression, or the pharmacological effects of antidepressants.

There was a significant decrease in the Ki for haloperidol displaceable [I-125]iodosulpride binding in the pituitary (p < 0.01) and caudate-putamen (p < 0.05) from subjects with schizophrenia with residual drugs in their tissue. There was a significant decrease in the density of [I-125]iodosulpride in the pituitary (p < 0.001) and a strong trend to a decrease in binding in the caudate-putamen (p = 0.055) from subjects with schizophrenia. By contrast, [H-3]spiperone binding was decreased in the caudate-putamen (p < 0.05) with a trend to decreased binding in the pituitary (p = 0.07) from subjects with schizophrenia. There was no difference in the density of dopamine D-2 receptors in the caudate-putamen from subjects with schizophrenia (p = 0.31). All the findings on receptor densities were independent of drug status. [I-125]iodosulpride binds to the dopamine D-2&3 receptors. We have shown that there is no change in the dopamine D-2 receptor in the caudate-putamen from subjects with schizophrenia and therefore, these data would be consistent with there being a decrease in the dopamine D-3 in the caudate-putamen from subjects with schizophrenia. Since dopamine D-3 receptors are absent or present at low concentrations in the pituitary, our data would suggest the dopamine D-2 receptor is decreased in that tissue from schizophrenic subjects.

This study was designed to examine effects of LV unloading on beta-adrenergic receptor (BAR) expression and ischemic susceptibility to ischemia reperfusion. Methods: Five groups were studied: group 1 [unloading myocardial infarction (MI), n = 61, Ml hearts 2 weeks after coronary ligation subjected to LV unloading by heterotopic heart transplantation for 2 weeks; group 2 (2-week Ml, n = 6), Ml hearts left for 2 weeks without unloading; group 3 (4-week Ml, n = 6), MI hearts leftfor 4 weeks without unloading; group 4 (control, n = 6), normal (non-MI) hearts as a control with no interventions, and group 5 (unloading control, n = 5), normal (non-MI) hearts subjected to LV unloading for 2 weeks. Then, all hearts were isolated and subjected to 20 min of global ischemia and 60 min of reperfusion on Langendorff apparatus. LV pressures and coronary flow were measured throughout the experiment. Either total BAR density or beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (B2AR) mRNA expression in the noninfarcted myocardium was determined by radioligand binding assays or real-time quantitative RT-PCR, respectively. Results: LV unloading improved postischemic functional recovery (unloading MI vs. 2-week MI vs. 4-week MI: 74 +/- 6 vs. 54 +/- 5 vs. 51 +/- 4%; p < 0.05 vs. unloading MI). LV unloading restored B2AR mRNA expression (unloading MI vs. 2-week Ml vs. 4-week MI: 4.78 +/- 0.21 vs. 2.80 +/- 0.19 vs. 2.24 +/- 0.17 X 10(7) copy/mug total RNA; p < 0.05 vs. unloading MI). Conclusion: LV mechanical unloading restored B2AR mRNA expression and improved postischemic functional recovery. Copyright (C) 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel.

In this study, we explored the ligand binding pocket of the Group III mGluR4 receptor subtype using site-directed mutagenesis and radioligand binding. The selection of 16 mutations was guided by a molecular model of mGluR4, which was based on the crystal structure of the mGluR1 receptor. Lysines 74 and 405 are present on lobe I of mGluR4. The mutation of lysine 405 to alanine virtually eliminated the binding of the agonist [H-3]L-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate ([H-3]L-AP4). Thus lysine 405, which is conserved in all eight mGluRs, likely represents a fundamental recognition residue for ligand binding to the mGluRs. Single point mutations of lysines 74 or 317, which are not conserved in the mGluRs, to alanine had no effect on agonist affinity, whereas mutation of both residues together caused a loss of ligand binding. Mutation of lysine 74 in mGluR4, or the analogous lysine in mGluR8, to tyrosine (mimicking mGluR1 at this position) produced a large decrease in binding. The reduction in binding is likely due to steric hindrance of the phenolic side chain of tyrosine. The mutation of glutamate 287 to alanine, which is present on lobe II and is not conserved in the mGluR family, caused a loss of [H-3]L-AP4 binding. We conclude that the determinants of high affinity ligand binding are dispersed across lobes I and II. Our results define a microenvironment within the binding pocket that encompasses several positively charged amino acids that recognize the negatively charged phosphonate group Of L-AP4 or the endogenous compound L-serine-O-phosphate.

Design: Four groups of animals were considered. (i) control rats at thermoneutrality, (ii) cold-acclimated rats, to determine beta -AR under continuous sympathetic stimulation, which is known to decrease noradrenaline responsiveness, (iii) oestradiol- and (iv) progesterone-treated cold-acclimated rats to determine hormonal effects on beta -AR populations in thermogenically active brown adipocytes. Methods: Oestradiol and progesterone were chronically elevated by means of s.c. Silastic implants. Densities and affinities of beta -AR populations were determined by binding studies using [H-3]CGP 12177 as radioligand. Results: Two populations of low and high binding affinities (K-d 1.6 and 27.3 nmol/l) corresponding to beta (3)- and beta (1)/beta (2)-AR respectively were found at thermoneutrality. beta (3)-AR density was higher than that of beta (1)/beta (2)-AR (B-max 419 and 143 fmol/mg protein respectively). Cold-acclimated rats showed a reduction of beta (3)-AR binding capacity (B-max 308 fmol/mg protein). Oestradiol and progesterone reduced the density of beta (3)-AR to 167 and 185 fmol/mg protein respectively, while increasing their affinity for [H-3]CGP-12177 (K-d 9.5 and 4.0 nmol/l vs 16 nmol/l in cold-acclimated untreated rats). The density of beta (1)/beta (2)-AR was also reduced after oestradiol treatment (B-max 51 fmol/mg protein). Conclusions: Both oestradiol and progesterone reduce the density of beta (3)-AR in brown adipose tissue (BAT) while increasing their affinity for [H-3]CGP-12177. Oestradiol also reduces the density of beta (1)/beta (2),AR whereas cold-acclimation reduces the density of beta (3)-AR.

J	DiPaola, NR; Sweet, WE; Stull, LB; Francis, GS; Moravec, CS				DiPaola, NR; Sweet, WE; Stull, LB; Francis, GS; Moravec, CS			Beta-adrenergic receptors and calcium cycling proteins in non-failing, hypertrophied and failing human hearts: Transition from hypertrophy to failure	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR CARDIOLOGY			English	Article						hypertrophy; sarcoplasmic reticulum; calcium; beta-adrenergic receptors; heart failure	LEFT-VENTRICULAR HYPERTROPHY; NONFAILING HUMAN HEARTS; SARCOPLASMIC-RETICULUM; CARDIAC-HYPERTROPHY; GENE-EXPRESSION; MYOCARDIAL HYPERTROPHY; PHOSPHOLAMBAN GENE; RATS; SECONDARY; CLONING	Left ventricular hypertrophy may lead to heart failure. The transition between hypertrophy and heart failure is, however, incompletely understood. On the cellular level. human heart failure is characterized by alterations in Ca2+-cycling proteins and beta -adrenergic receptor density. but the hypertrophied human heart remains largely understudied. In this investigation, 21 donor hearts which could not be used for transplantation were studied. Ten of these hearts came from organ donors with documented left ventricular hypertrophy and normal cardiac function. Eleven of the hearts were non-failing, obtained from individuals with no evidence of cardiac disease. Nine failing hearts from transplant recipients were also studied. beta -adrenergic receptor density was determined by radioligand binding. mRNA for atrial natriuretic factor, calsequestrin, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, and phospholamban was measured by Northern blot. Actin, calsequestrin, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, and phospholamban proteins were quantified by Western blot. In both hypertrophied and failing ventricles, mRNA for atrial natriuretic factor was expressed. as compared to no expression in non-failing hearts. In failing hearts, beta -adrenergic receptor density and both mRNA and protein levels of the Ca2+-ATPase were significantly decreased nu non-failing hearts. By comparison, hypertrophied hearts showed a reduction in mRNA expression for both the Ca2+-ATPase and phospholamban with no change in the corresponding protein levels, and no change in beta -receptors. These data suggest that the previously demonstrated reduction in beta -adrenergic receptors and Ca2+-cycling proteins in the failing human heart may be features of the decompensated state, but are not found in human hearts with left ventricular hypertrophy and preserved systolic function.

Methods: Fetal VSMCs were prepared from rat fetal aorta at embryonic day 20. Expression of Ang II receptors was measured by a radioligand binding assay. Apoptotic changes were assessed by caspase 3 activity and chromatin dye staining. Regulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity via Ang II receptors was analysed by determinating phosphorylated ERK with Western blot. Ang II receptor-mediated activation of tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 was assessed by protein tyrosine phosphatase assay. Results: The expression of AT1 and AT2 receptors was approximately 70%: 30% per cell. Serum depletion induced apoptosis in fetal VSMCs and selective AT1 receptor stimulation attenuated the apoptotic changes, whereas selective AT2 receptor activation enhanced apoptosis. Ang II increased ERK phosphorylation, which was inhibited by addition of the AT1 receptor-specific antagonist CV11974, but enhanced by addition of the AT2 receptor-specific antagonist PD123319, suggesting that activation of AT2 receptor attenuated the AT1 receptor-mediated ERK phosphorylation. Moreover, we demonstrated that AT2 receptor stimulation activated SHP-1 in fetal VSMCs, whereas AT1 receptor stimulation did not. Transient transfection of a dominant-negative SHP-1 mutant into rat fetal VSMCs resulted in a significant decrease of the AT2 receptor-mediated inhibition of ERK phosphorylation and attenuated the proapoptotic effect of AT2 receptor. Conclusion: These results indicate that a crosstalk between AT1 and AT2 receptors regulates the survival of fetal VSMCs and substantiate SHP-1 as a key molecule in AT2 receptor signaling.

Chronic use of cocaine may lead to a 'serotonin-deficit' form of 5-HT dysregulation. We have examined the status of the 5-HT transporter (SERT) using ligand binding and autoradiographic methods in subgroups of cocaine overdose deaths. Quantitative autoradiography of [I-125]RTI-55 was used to map and measure the effect of chronic cocaine use on SERT densities in the striatum, substantia nigra, amygdala, and adjacent paralimbic cortical areas of cocaine overdose (CO) victims with and without preterminal evidence of excited delirium (ED). SERT densities were elevated in the nucleus accumbens and throughout the anterior and posterior sectors of striatum in CO victims compared with age-matched and drug-free control subjects. In contrast, SERT densities were increased significantly in the anterior striatum, but not the posterior sectors in ED victims. Significant elevations in SERT were measured in the orbitofrontal gyrus (Brodmann area 11), the anterior portion of the insular cortex and the cingulate gyrus (Brodmann area 24) in CO and ED victims. Saturation binding site analysis demonstrated an increase in the density of RTI-55 binding sites with no change in the affinity of the radioligand for the SERT. Chronic cocaine exposure upregulated SERT densities in the substantia nigra of the CO, but not ED victims. The lack of SERT upregulation in the substania nigra and posterior striatum suggests the possibility of a distinct phenotype for fatal ED victims that exhibited an acute onset of bizarre and violent behavior prior to death. Adaptive changes in the SERT densities may contribute to depressed mood and drug craving associated with acute cocaine abstinence. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Most antidepressants ameliorate depressive symptoms by increasing 5-HT at synaptic clefts, but their effect on 5-HT receptors has yet to be clarified. C-11-WAY-100635 and F-18-MPPF are positron emission tomography (PET) radioligands for 5-HT1A receptors. While binding of both ligands reflects 5-HT1A receptor density, F-18-MPPF biding may also be affected by extracellular 5-HT concentrations. This dual-tracer PET study explored the neurochemical substrates underlying antidepressant effects in patients with depression. Methods Eleven patients with depression, including 9 treated with antidepressants, and 16 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals underwent PET scans with C-11-WAY-100635 and F-18-MPPF. Radioligand binding was determined by calculating the nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND). Results Patients treated with antidepressants showed significantly lower F-18-MPPF BPND in neocortical regions and raphe nuclei, but not in limbic regions, than controls. No significant group differences in C-11-WAY-100635 BPND were found in any of the regions. Significant correlations of BPND between C-11-WAY-100635 and F-18-MPPF were observed in limbic regions and raphe nuclei of healthy controls, but no such associations were found in antidepressant-treated patients. Moreover, F-18-MPPF BPND in limbic regions was significantly correlated with the severity of depressive symptoms. Conclusions These results suggest a diversity of antidepressant-induced extracellular 5-HT elevations in the limbic system among depressive patients, which is associated with the individual variability of clinical symptoms following the treatment.

It is an established and emergent drug target in metabolic disease. The PET radioligand 68Ga-DO3A-VS-exendin4 (68Ga-exendin4) has the potential to enable longitudinal studies of GLP1R in the human pancreas. Methods: 68Ga-exendin4 PET/CT examinations were performed on overweight-to-obese individuals with type 2 diabetes (n 5 13) as part of a larger target engagement study (NCT03350191). A scanning protocol was developed to optimize reproducibility (target amount of 0.5 MBq/kg [corresponding to peptide amount of ,0.2 mg/kg], blood sampling, and tracer stability assessment). The pancreas and abdominal organs were segmented, and binding was correlated with clinical parameters. Results: Uptake of 68Ga-exendin4 in the pancreas, but not in other abdominal tissues, was high but variable between individuals. There was no evidence of self-blocking of GLP1R by the tracer in this protocol, despite the high potency of exendin4. The results showed that a full dynamic scan can be simplified to a short static scan, potentially increasing throughput and reducing patient discomfort. The 68Ga-exendin4 concentration in the pancreas (i.e., GLP1R density) correlated inversely with the age of the individual and tended to correlate positively with body mass index. However, the total GLP1R content in the pancreas did not. Conclusion: In summary, we present an optimized and simplified 68Ga-exendin4 scanning protocol to enable reproducible imaging of GLP1R in the pancreas. 68Ga-exendin4 PET may enable quantification of longitudinal changes in pancreatic GLP1R during the development of type 2 diabetes, as well as target engagement studies of novel glucagonlike peptide-1 agonists.

J	Matheson, GJ; Ogden, RT				Matheson, Granville J.; Ogden, R. Todd			Simultaneous multifactor Bayesian analysis (SiMBA) of PET time activity curve data	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; REFERENCE TISSUE MODEL; SEROTONIN 1A BINDING; MAJOR DEPRESSION; 5-HT1A RECEPTOR; NONLINEAR-REGRESSION; WEIGHTING FACTORS; BRAIN; RADIOLIGAND; OCCUPANCY	Positron emission tomography (PET) is an in vivo imaging method essential for studying the neurochemical pathophysiology of psychiatric and neurological disease. However, its high cost and exposure of participants to radiation make it unfeasible to employ large sample sizes. The major shortcoming of PET imaging is therefore its lack of power for studying clinically-relevant research questions. Here, we introduce a new method for performing PET quantification and analysis called SiMBA, which helps to alleviate these issues by improving the efficiency of PET analysis by exploiting similarities between both individuals and regions within individuals. In simulated [C-11]WAY100635 data, SiMBA greatly improves both statistical power and the consistency of effect size estimation without affecting the false positive rate. This approach makes use of hierarchical, multifactor, multivariate Bayesian modelling to effectively borrow strength across the whole dataset to improve stability and robustness to measurement error. In so doing, parameter identifiability and estimation are improved, without sacrificing model interpretability. This comes at the cost of increased computational overhead, however this is practically negligible relative to the time taken to collect PET data. This method has the potential to make it possible to test clinically-relevant hypotheses which could never be studied before given the practical constraints. Furthermore, because this method does not require any additional information over and above that required for traditional analysis, it makes it possible to re-examine data which has already previously been collected at great expense. In the absence of dramatic advancements in PET image data quality, radiotracer development, or data sharing, PET imaging has been fundamentally limited in the scope of research hypotheses which could be studied. This method, especially combined with the recent steps taken by the PET imaging community to embrace data sharing, will make it possible to greatly improve the research possibilities and clinical relevance of PET neuroimaging.

Here, we present the DopamiNe, Age, connectoMe, and Cognition (DyNAMiC) project, a multimodal, prospective 5-year longitudinal study spanning the adult human lifespan. DyNAMiC examines age-related changes in the brain's structural and functional connectome in relation to changes in dopamine D1 receptor availability (D1DR), and their associations to cognitive decline. Critically, due to the complete lack of longitudinal D1DR data, the true trajectory of one of the most age-sensitive dopamine systems remains unknown. The first DyNAMiC wave included 180 healthy participants (20-80 years). Brain imaging included magnetic resonance imaging assessing brain structure (white matter, gray matter, iron), perfusion, and function (during rest and task), and positron emission tomography (PET) with the [C-11]SCH23390 radioligand. A subsample (n = 20, >65 years) was additionally scanned with [C-11]raclopride PET measuring D2DR. Age-related variation was evident for multiple modalities, such as D1DR; D2DR, and performance across the domains of episodic memory, working memory, and perceptual speed. Initial analyses demonstrated an inverted u-shaped association between D1DR and resting-state functional connectivity across cortical network nodes, such that regions with intermediate D1DR levels showed the highest levels of nodal strength. Evident within each age group, this is the first observation of such an association across the adult lifespan, suggesting that emergent functional architecture depends on underlying D1DR systems. Taken together, DyNAMiC is the largest D1DR study worldwide, and will enable a comprehensive examination of brain mechanisms underlying age-related cognitive decline.

Effects of the sigma-1 receptor agonist blarcamesine in a murine model of fragile X syndrome: neurobehavioral phenotypes and receptor occupancy	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							FMR1 KNOCKOUT MICE; MOUSE MODEL; AUTISM; BDNF; RADIOLIGAND; GENERATION; ANAVEX2-73	Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a disorder of synaptic development and function, is the most prevalent genetic form of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. FXS mouse models display clinically-relevant phenotypes, such as increased anxiety and hyperactivity. Despite their availability, so far advances in drug development have not yielded new treatments. Therefore, testing novel drugs that can ameliorate FXS' cognitive and behavioral impairments is imperative. ANAVEX2-73 (blarcamesine) is a sigma-1 receptor (S1R) agonist with a strong safety record and preliminary efficacy evidence in patients with Alzheimer's disease and Rett syndrome, other synaptic neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders. S1R's role in calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial function, cellular functions related to synaptic function, makes blarcamesine a potential drug candidate for FXS. Administration of blarcamesine in 2-month-old FXS and wild type mice for 2 weeks led to normalization in two key neurobehavioral phenotypes: open field test (hyperactivity) and contextual fear conditioning (associative learning). Furthermore, there was improvement in marble-burying (anxiety, perseverative behavior). It also restored levels of BDNF, a converging point of many synaptic regulators, in the hippocampus. Positron emission tomography (PET) and ex vivo autoradiographic studies, using the highly selective S1R PET ligand [F-18]FTC-146, demonstrated the drug's dose-dependent receptor occupancy. Subsequent analyses also showed a wide but variable brain regional distribution of S1Rs, which was preserved in FXS mice. Altogether, these neurobehavioral, biochemical, and imaging data demonstrates doses that yield measurable receptor occupancy are effective for improving the synaptic and behavioral phenotype in FXS mice. The present findings support the viability of S1R as a therapeutic target in FXS, and the clinical potential of blarcamesine in FXS and other neurodevelopmental disorders.

Current antidepressant drugs are not fully effective. According to literature data, the effect on D2R or 5-HT1AR can effectively reduce the symptoms of depression or schizophrenia. Recent research hypothetized that the synergism of both of these receptors can improve the effectiveness of therapy. Ipsapirone, a representative of long-chain arylpiperazines, is a known 5-HT1AR ligand that has antidepressant effect. This compound has no affinity for the D2R. Bearing in mind, we decided to design ligands with improved affinity to D2R and confirmed that in some cases elongation of the carbon linker or arylpiperazine exchange may have beneficial influence on the binding to D2R and 5-HT1AR. Four groups of ligands being ipsapirone analogues with butyl, pentyl, hexyl and stiffened xylene chains were designed. All compounds were obtained in solvent-free reactions supported by a microwave irradiation with an efficiency mainly above 60%. All ligands containing 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)piperazine exhibited high affinity to 5-HT1AR. In this case, chemical modifications within the chain did not affect the affinity to D2R. In the case of ligands containing 1-phenylpiperazine, 1-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine, 1-(1-naphthyl) piperazine, and 1-(4-chlorophenyl)piperazine, elongation of carbon linker increases of affinity to D2R. For ligands containing 1- (2-pyridyl) piperazine, and 1-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)piperazine, we observed an opposite effect. For ligands containing 1-phenylpiperazine, 1-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazine and 1-(2-pyridyl)piperazine, chain elongation had no effect on 5-HT1AR binding. In turn of ligands containing 1-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl) piperazine and 1- (2,3-dichlorophenyl)piperazine, we observed that elongation of carbon linker has a positive influence to 5-HT1AR. Molecular modelling was used to support the SAR study.

The endocytosis of nAChRs plays important roles in the pathogenesis of neurological diseases, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Experimental Approach Loss-of-function approaches and mutants of alpha 4 beta 2 nAChRs that display different endocytic properties were used to identify the cellular components and processes responsible for endocytosis. The signalling cascade that leads to endocytosis was deduced via protein interactions in predicted cellular components. The endocytosis of alpha 4 beta 2 nAChRs was determined and crosschecked using an ELISA and radioligand assay. Key Results Endocytosis of alpha 4 beta 2 nAChRs occurred through clathrin-mediated endocytosis in a dynamin-dependent manner. 14-3-3 eta-dependent Src-mediated phosphorylation of the nAChR alpha 4 subunit at Y575 was required for nAChR endocytosis, and this occurred with the assistance of beta-arrestin1 and GPCR kinase 2 (GRK2) without the need for kinase activity. Endocytosis triggered the mouse double minute 2 homologue-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent down-regulation of alpha 4 beta 2 nAChRs. Conclusions and Implications alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR, an ionophore receptor, employs the metabotropic signalling pathway required for endocytosis, which leads to ubiquitination and down-regulation. Further, GRK2 and beta-arrestin1, usually associated with GPCR signalling, are involved in the endocytosis of alpha 4 beta 2 nAChRs via different mechanisms. Considering the functional and pathological implications of nAChR endocytosis, results obtained in this study are crucial for the progression of basic research and clinical investigations.

U-II exerts its response via activation of a G-protein coupled receptor, Urotensin II receptor(UT). Binding of U-II to UT leads to an instant increase in the inositol phosphate turnover and intracellular Ca2+. Such an instant Ca2+ release and potent vasoconstriction exerted by U-II is expected to have an important role in the progression of cardiac diseases. We have previously shown that UT antagonist D537001789 prevents U-II induced blood pressure elevation in mice (Nishi et al., 2019) in a dose dependent manner, with potent efficacy at 30 and 100 mg/kg. Further to this, we have also shown that D537001789 ameliorates mortality in pressure-overload mice with heart failure (Nishi et al., 2020). We therefore conducted an extensive structure-activity relationship studies to identify molecules with superior efficacy. In the present manuscript, we report the identification of two potent, non-peptide small molecule antagonists of Urotensin II receptor (UT), RCI-0879 and RCI-0298 which blocked the action of U-II, both in vitro and in vivo. These molecules were found to be very potent in in vitro Ca2+ and radioligand binding assays using human and mouse UT over-expressing CHO cells. RCI-0879 and RCI-0298 also exhibited superior efficacy in in vivo mouse pressor response model using C57BL/6 mice, compared to our initial molecules (Nishi et al., 2019) and demonstrated ED(50)( )values of 3.2 mg/kg and 6.8 mg/kg respectively. Our findings reported herewith, further strengthen our concept and belief in UT antagonization as a potential therapeutic approach for the management of chronic heart failure.

However, CB2Rs distribution and signaling pathways in physiological and pathological conditions are still controversial mainly because of the lack of reliable diagnostic tools. With the aim to produce green and safe systems to detect CB2R, we designed a series of fluorescent ligands with three different green fluorescent moieties (4-dimethylaminophthalimide, 4-DMAP, 7-nitro-4-yl-aminobenzoxadiazole, NBD, and Fluorescein-thiourea, FTU) linked to the N1-position of the CB2R pharmacophore N-adamantyl-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxamide through polymethylene chains. Compound 28 emerged for its compromise between good pharmacodynamic properties (CB2R K-1 = 130 nM and no affinity vs the other subtype CB1R) and optimal fluorescent spectroscopic properties. Therefore, compound 28 was studied through FACS (saturation and competitive binding studies) and fluorescence microscopy (visualization and competitive binding) in engineered cells (CB2R-HEK293 cells) and in diverse tumour cells. The fluoligand binding assays were successfully set up, and affinity values for the two reference compounds GW405833 and WIN55,212-2, comparable to the values obtained by radioligand binding assays, were obtained. Fluoligand 28 also allowed the detection of the presence and quantification of the CB2R in the same cell lines. The interactions of compound 28 within the CB2R binding site were also investigated by molecular docking simulations, and indications for the improvement of the CB2R affinity of this class of compounds were provided. Overall, the results obtained through these studies propose compound 28 as a safe and green alternative to the commonly used radioligands for in vitro investigations. (C) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, the dopamine D3 receptor (D3R) has been an exception wherein agonist induces D3Rs to undergo desensitization followed by pharmacological sequestration - which is defined as the sequestration of cell surface receptors into a more hydrophobic fraction within the plasma membrane without undergoing the process of receptor internalization. Pharmacological sequestration renders the receptor in an inactive state on the membrane. In our previous study we demonstrated that a novel class of D3R agonists exemplified by SK608 have biased signaling properties via the G-protein dependent pathway and do not induce D3R desensitization. In this study, using radioligand binding assay, immunoblot or immunocytochemistry methods, we observed that SK608 induced internalization of human D3R stably expressed in CHO, HEK and SH-SY5Y cells which are derived from neuroblastoma cells, suggesting that it is not a cell-type specific event. Further, we have evaluated the potential mechanism of D3R internalization induced by these biased signaling agonists. SK608-induced D3R internalization was time- and concentration-dependent. In comparison, dopamine induced D3R upregulation and pharmacological sequestration in the same assays. GRK2 and clathrin/dynamin I/II are the key molecular players in the SK608-induced D3R internalization process, while beta-arrestin 1/2 and GRK-interacting protein 1(GIT1) are not involved. These results suggest that SK608-promoted D3R internalization is similar to the type II internalization observed among peptide binding GPCRs.

Among these compounds, N-methyl (AHN1055), N-allyl (AHN2-005), and N-butyl (JHW007) analogs of 3 alpha-[bis(4'-fluorophenyl) methoxy]-tropane were more potent in antagonizing self-administration of cocaine and d-methamphetamine than in decreasing food-maintained responding. The antagonism of cocaine self-administration (0.03-1.0 mg/kg per injection) with the above BZT analogs was reproduced in the present study. Further, the stimulant-antagonist effects resembled previously reported effects of pretreatments with combinations of standard DAT inhibitors and sigma(1)-receptor (sigma R-1) antagonists. Therefore, the present study examined binding of the BZT analogs to sigma Rs, as well as their in vivo sigma R antagonist effects. Each of the BZT analogs displaced radiolabeled sR ligands with nanomolar affinity. Further, self-administration of the sR agonist DTG (0.1-3.2 mg/kg/injection) was dose dependently blocked by AHN2-005 and JHW007 but potentiated by AHN1-055. In contrast, none of the BZT analogs that were active against DTG self-administration was active against the self-administration of agonists at dopamine D-1-like [R(+)-SKF 81297, (+/-)-SKF 82958 (0.00032-0.01 mg/kg per injection each)], D-2-like [R(-)-NPA (0.0001-0.0032 mg/kg per injection), (-)-quinpirole (0.0032-0.1mg/kg per injection)], or mu-opioid (remifentanil, 0.0001-0.0032 mg/kg per injection) receptors. The present results indicate that behavioral antagonist effects of the N-substituted BZT analogs are specific for abused drugs acting at the DAT and further suggest that sR antagonism contributes to those actions.

Characterization of PCS1055, a novel muscarinic M<sub>4</sub> receptor antagonist	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Muscarinic M-4 receptors; Competitive antagonists; PCS1055; Subtype selectivity	TREMULOUS JAW MOVEMENTS; ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; CHOLINERGIC INTERNEURONS; ALLOSTERIC MODULATION; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; PROTEIN; SCHIZOPHRENIA; PHARMACOLOGY; DYSFUNCTION	Identification of synthetic ligands selective for muscarinic receptor subtypes has been challenging due to the high sequence identity and structural homology among the five muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Here, we report the pharmacological characterization of PCS1055, a novel muscarinic M-4 receptor antagonist. PCS1055 inhibited radioligand [H-3]-NMS binding to the M-4 receptor with a K-i=6.5 nM. Though the potency of PCS1055 is lower than that of pan-muscarinic antagonist atropine, it has better subtype selectivity over previously reported M-4-selective reagents such as the muscarinic-peptide toxins (Karlsson et al., 1994; Santiago and Potter, 2001a) at the M-1 subtype, and benzoxazine ligand PD102807 at the M-3-subtype (Bohme et al., 2002). A detailed head-to-head comparison study using [H-3]-NMS competitive binding assays characterizes the selectivity profiles of PCS1055 to that of other potent muscarinic-antagonist compounds PD102807, tropicamide, AF-DX-384, pirenzapine, and atropine. In addition to binding studies, the subtype specificity of PCS1055 is also demonstrated by functional receptor activation as readout by GTP-gamma-[S-35] binding. These GTP-gamma-[S-35] binding studies showed that PCS1055 exhibited 255-, 69.1-, 342- and > 1000-fold greater inhibition of Oxo-M activity at the M-4 versus the M-1-, M-2-, M-3-or M-5 receptor subtypes, respectively. Schild analyses indicates that PCS1055 acts as a competitive antagonist to muscarinic M-4 receptor, and confirms the affinity of the ligand to be low nanomolar, Kb = 5.72 nM. Therefore, PCS1055 represents a new M-4-preferring antagonist that may be useful in elucidating the roles of M-4 receptor signaling. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in a hospital-based cohort of pediatric Type 1 DM patients (n = 85, mean(+/- SD) age: 13.5 +/- 3.4 years, mean(+/- SD) disease duration 5.5 +/- 3.4 years). Peripheral neuropathy was assessed with nerve conduction studies (NCS). GADA and IA-2A titers were measured with radioligand assays. Results: Among the study population, 34.1% had at least one abnormal electrophysiological parameter, although predominantly asymptomatic. The highest rates of abnormality were detected in sensory peroneal nerve (25.9%) followed by sural nerve (15.3%). Affected patients were not different in terms of age, diabetes duration or glycaemic control. Among the participants, 62.4% had positive GADA, 58.8% positive IA-2A and 42.4% double antibody positivity. Abnormal NCS correlated neither with GADA nor with IA-2A levels or positivity. However lower sensory nerve action potential in the peroneal nerve, indicative of early axonal dysfunction, was observed in patients with GADA or IA-2A positivity. Absence of both antibodies was associated with better action potentials in all the examined nerves of the lower limbs. Conclusions: Impaired indices of subclinical peripheral primarily sensory neuropathy were present among one third of Type 1 DM children and adolescents, with no impact of diabetes duration or glycaemic control. GADA and IA-2A seem to be involved in the development of axonal degeneration, in a pathway which remains to be identified. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Functional binding assays for estimation of the intrinsic efficacy of ligands at the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor: Application for screening drug candidates	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGICAL AND TOXICOLOGICAL METHODS			English	Article						Antipsychotics; Binding; Drug; Efficacy; 5-HT; Methods; Schizophrenia; Screening; Serotonin	AGONIST PROPERTIES; G-PROTEINS; RECOMBINANT; ANTAGONIST; AFFINITY; ANTIPSYCHOTICS; MECHANISMS; GPCR	Introduction: Determination of the intrinsic efficacy of ligands at the 5-HT1A receptor is important for selecting drug candidates, e. g. in the case of schizophrenia where partial agonism is a favorable property shared by different atypical antipsychotics. Methods: Using seven ligands with different intrinsic efficacies and rat hippocampus synaptosomes, we compared critically three "functional" binding assays based on the ternary complex model that considers that the activated conformation of the receptor is the one coupled to G-protein. Results: The K-i ratio method, based on the difference of affinity of the competing drug when using an antagonist vs. an agonist as radioligand, discriminated the ligands according to their intrinsic efficacies, with values from 77 for the full agonist 5-hydroxytryptamine to 0.09 for the inverse agonist WAY 100,635. The GTP-shift method, based on the decrease of affinity observed with agonists when GTP is added to the competition binding assay, was equally effective in classifying the drugs according to their intrinsic efficacy. The lower sensibility of the GTP-shift assay was investigated and explained by the different ionic conditions used in the two assays and the way competition curves were analyzed. Albeit more direct, the assay based on agonist-stimulated [S-35]-GTP gamma S binding to G proteins was more expensive and of greater variability in our hands. Discussion: We conclude that the GTP-shift procedure described herein for 5-HT1A receptors may expedite drug discovery efforts by predicting at the same time the affinity and intrinsic efficacy of ligands through a simple, rapid and economic ligand binding assay.

We noticed that GW4064 activated empty luciferase reporters in FXR-deficient HEK-293T cells. We postulated that this activity of GW4064 might be routed through as yet unknown cellular targets and undertook an unbiased exploratory approach to identify these targets. Investigations revealed that GW4064 activated cAMP and nuclear factor for activated T-cell response elements (CRE and NFAT-RE, respectively) present on these empty reporters. Whereas GW4064-induced NFAT-RE activation involved rapid intracellular Ca2+ accumulation and NFAT nuclear translocation, CRE activation involved soluble adenylyl cyclase-dependent cAMP accumulation and Ca2+-calcineurin-dependent nuclear translocation of transducers of regulated CRE-binding protein 2. Use of dominant negative heterotrimeric G-protein minigenes revealed that GW4064 caused activation of G alpha(i/o) and G(q/11) G proteins. Sequential pharmacological inhibitor-based screening and radioligand-binding studies revealed that GW4064 interacted with multiple G protein-coupled receptors. Functional studies demonstrated that GW4064 robustly activated H1 and H4 and inhibited H2 histamine receptor signaling events. We also found that MCF-7 breast cancer cells, reported to undergo GW4064-induced apoptosis in an FXR-dependent manner, did not express FXR, and the GW4064-mediated apoptosis, also apparent in HEK-293T cells, could be blocked by selective histamine receptor regulators. Taken together, our results demonstrate identification of histamine receptors as alternate targets for GW4064, which not only necessitates cautious interpretation of the biological functions attributed to FXR using GW4064 as a pharmacological tool but also provides a basis for the rational designing of new pharmacophores for histamine receptor modulation.

Relations between stimulation of mesolimbic dopamine and place conditioning in rats produced by cocaine or drugs that are tolerant to dopamine transporter conformational change	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Dopamine transporter conformation; Accumbens shell; Drug abuse; Dopamine microdialysis; Place preference; Benztropine analogs; Cocaine	INTRAVENOUS COCAINE; UPTAKE INHIBITORS; EXTRACELLULAR DOPAMINE; BENZTROPINE ANALOGS; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; BINDING; AMPHETAMINE; TRANSMISSION; ANTAGONIST; BLOCKADE	Rationale Dopamine transporter (DAT) conformation plays a role in the effectiveness of cocaine-like and other DAT inhibitors. Cocaine-like stimulants are intolerant to DAT conformation changes having decreased potency in cells transfected with DAT constructs that face the cytosol compared to wild-type DAT. In contrast, analogs of benztropine (BZT) are among compounds that are less affected by DAT conformational change. Methods We compared the displacement of radioligand binding to various mammalian CNS sites, acute stimulation of accumbens shell dopamine levels, and place conditioning in rats among cocaine and four BZT analogs with Cl substitutions on the diphenyl-ether system including two with carboalkoxy substitutions at the 2-position of the tropane ring. Results Binding assays confirmed high-affinity and selectivity for the DAT with the BZT analogs which also produced significant stimulation of mesolimbic dopamine efflux. Because BZT analogs produced temporal patterns of extracellular dopamine levels different from those by cocaine (3-10 mg/kg, i.p.), the place conditioning produced by BZT analogs and cocaine was compared at doses and times at which both the increase in dopamine levels and rates of increase were similar to those produced by an effective dose of cocaine. Despite this equilibration, none of the BZT analogs tested produced significant place conditioning. Conclusions The present results extend previous findings suggesting that cocaine-like actions are dependent on a binding equilibrium that favors the outward conformational state of the DAT. In contrast, BZT analogs with reduced dependence on DAT conformation have reduced cocaine-like behavioral effects and may prove useful in development of medications for stimulant abuse.

Objective: Although the proinflammatory function of CRTH2 is well recognized and CRTH2 is hence considered an important emerging pharmacotherapeutic target, the role of the DP receptor in mediating the biological effects of PGD(2) in patients with allergic inflammation has remained unclear. Methods: The cross-talk of CRTH2 and DP receptors was investigated by using both a recombinant HEK293 cell model and human eosinophils in Ca2+ mobilization assays, coimmunoprecipitation, Western blotting, radioligand binding, and immunofluorescence. Results: We show that CRTH2 and DP receptors modulate one another's signaling properties and form CRTH2/DP heteromers without altering their ligand-binding capacities. We find that the DP receptor amplifies the CRTH2-induced Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and coincidentally forfeits its own signaling potency. Moreover, desensitization or pharmacologic blockade of the DP receptor hinders CRTH2-mediated signal transduction. However, CRTH2 internalization occurs independently of the DP receptor. In cells that express both receptors, pharmacologic blockade of G(aq/11) proteins abolishes the Ca2+ response to both CRTH2 and DP agonists, whereas inhibition of G(alpha i) proteins selectively attenuates the CRTH2-mediated response but not the DP signal. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate the capacity of DP receptors to amplify the biological response to CRTH2 activation. Therefore the CRTH2/DP heteromer might not only represent a functional signaling unit for PGD(2) but also a potential target for the development of heteromer-directed therapies to treat allergic diseases.

The levels of GAD65Abs and their reactivities to N-terminal (GAD65-N), middle (GAD65-M) and C-terminal (GAD65-C) regions of human GAD65 were measured by radioligand assay in 109 patients with adult-onset T1DM and 107 with LADA. TPOAb, TGAb and the genotypes of HLADQA1-DQB1 were determined. The percentage of LADA patients with GAD65-NAb was significantly higher than that of adult-onset T1DM patients (21.5% vs. 11.0%, P = 0.037), but LADA patients with GAD65-CAb less than T1DM patients (47.7% vs. 70.6%, P = 0.001). LADA patients with both GAD65-M and GAD65-CAb (GAD65-M + CAb) appeared to be at higher risk for the development of thyroid autoimmunity, lower serum C-peptide level and the requirement for insulin therapy (P < 0.05). More frequent T1DM patients with HLADQA1*03-DQB1*0303 developed GAD65-M + CAb (55.8% vs. 35.1%, P = 0.008). In comparison with those without thyroid autoimmunity, more frequent T1DM patients and LADA patients with thyroid autoimmunity displayed GAD65-M + CAbs (44.0% vs.16.9% and 53.1% vs. 17.3%, P = 0.002 and < 0.001, respectively) with a diagnostic specificity of 83.1 or 82.7% for thyroid autoimmunity, respectively. LADA patients with GAD65-M + CAbs had clinical features similar to T1DM patients. Adult-onset T1DM and LADA patients with GAD65-M + CAbs are at an increased risk for the development of thyroid autoimmunity.

Impact of species variability and 'probe-dependence' on the detection and <i>in vivo</i> validation of allosteric modulation at the M<sub>4</sub> muscarinic acetylcholine receptor	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						allosteric interaction; antipsychotic; drug discovery; locomotor activity; muscarinic receptors; positive co-operativity; probe-dependence; radioligand binding; species variability; positive allosteric modulator	PHARMACOLOGICAL-TREATMENT; ANTIPSYCHOTIC-DRUGS; AGONIST XANOMELINE; NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS; KNOCKOUT MICE; SCHIZOPHRENIA; MECHANISMS; MODELS; DISORDERS; EFFICACY	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE We recently characterized LY2033298 as a novel allosteric modulator and agonist at M-4 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs). Evidence also suggested a difference in the potency of LY2033298 at rodent relative to human M-4 mAChRs. The current study investigated the basis for the species difference of this modulator and used this knowledge to rationalize its in vivo actions. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH LY2033298 was investigated in vitro in CHO cells stably expressing human or mouse M-4 mAChRs, using assays of agonist-induced ERK1/2 or GSK-3 alpha phosphorylation, [35S]-GTP gamma S binding, or effects on equilibrium binding of [3H]-NMS and ACh. The in vivo actions of LY2033298 were investigated in a mouse model of amphetamine-induced locomotor activity. The function of LY2033298 was examined in combination with ACh, oxotremorine or xanomeline. KEY RESULTS LY2033298 had similar affinities for the human and mouse M-4 mAChRs. However, LY2033298 had a lower positive co-operativity with ACh at the mouse relative to the human M-4 mAChR. At the mouse M-4 mAChR, LY2033298 showed higher co-operativity with oxotremorine than with ACh or xanomeline. The different degrees of co-operativity between LY2033298 and each agonist at the mouse relative to the human M-4 mAChR necessitated the co-administration of LY2033298 with oxotremorine in order to show in vivo efficacy of LY2033298. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS These results provide evidence for species variability when comparing the allosteric interaction between LY2033298 and ACh at the M-4 mAChR, and also highlight how the interaction between LY2033298 and different orthosteric ligands is subject to 'probe dependence'. This has implications for the validation of allosteric modulator actions in vivo.	[Suratman, S.; Leach, K.; Sexton, P. M.; Loiacono, R.

Emerging preclinical research suggests an important role for the 5-HT1B receptor in behavioral regulation and depressive phenotypes. In particular, 5-HT1B heteroreceptors located within the striatum have been shown to play an essential role in antidepressant action. The objective of this study was to determine 5-HT1B receptor binding potential (BP (ND)) in the region of the ventral striatum/ventral pallidum (VS/VP) in individuals with MDD and healthy control participants. Ten participants with MDD (30.8 +/- 9.5 years, five men/five women) in a current major depressive episode (MDE) and ten healthy control participants (30.7 +/- 10.5 years, five men/five women) underwent positron emission tomography (PET) scanning with the selective 5-HT1B receptor radioligand [C-11]P943. Within the VS/VP region of interest, [C-11]P943 BP (ND) was significantly reduced in the MDD group compared with the healthy control group (1.37 +/- 0.13 and 1.68 +/- 0.16, respectively; 18.7% between-group difference; p < 0.001). Consistent with preclinical and postmortem data, our findings suggest abnormally reduced function of VS/VP 5-HT1B receptors in humans with MDD. Abnormal 5-HT1B heteroreceptor function may contribute to dysfunctional reward signaling within the striatum, including the nucleus accumbens, via interaction with dopamine, gamma-amino-butyric acid, or glutamate systems. Our findings suggest reduced 5-HT1B receptor signaling in the VS/VP in MDD and contribute to the therapeutic rationale for testing 5-HT1B agonists as a novel class of antidepressants.

Position 5.46 of the Serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> Receptor Contributes to a Species-Dependent Variation for the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> Agonist (<i>R</i>)-9-Ethyl-1,3,4,10<i>b</i>-tetrahydro-7-trifluoromethylpyrazino[2,1-<i>a</i>]isoindol-6(2<i>H</i>)-one: Impact on Selectivity and Toxicological Evaluation	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; 5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE(2A) RECEPTORS; CARDIOVASCULAR-SYSTEM; BINDING; FENFLURAMINE; AFFINITY; LIGANDS; RAT; ERGOLINES; RESIDUE	Successful development of 5-HT2C agonists requires selectivity versus the highly homologous 5-HT2A receptor, because agonism at this receptor can result in significant adverse events. (R)-9-Ethyl-1,3,4,10b-tetrahydro-7-trifluoromethylpyrazino[2,1-a]-isoindol-6(2H)-one (compound 1) is a potent 5-HT2C agonist exhibiting selectivity over the human 5-HT2A receptor. Evaluation of the compound at the rat 5-HT2A receptor, however, revealed potent binding and agonist functional activity. The physiological consequence of this higher potency was the observation of a significant increase in blood pressure in conscious telemeterized rats that could be prevented by ketanserin. Docking of compound 1 in a homology model of the 5-HT2A receptor indicated a possible binding mode in which the ethyl group at the 9-position of the molecule was oriented toward position 5.46 of the 5-HT2A receptor. Within the human 5-HT2A receptor, position 5.46 is Ser242; however, in the rat 5-HT2A receptor, it is Ala242, suggesting that the potent functional activity in this species resulted from the absence of the steric bulk provided by the -OH moiety of the Ser in the human isoform. We confirmed this hypothesis using site-directed mutagenesis through the mutation of both the human receptor Ser242 to Ala and the rat receptor Ala242 to Ser, followed by radioligand binding and second messenger studies. In addition, we attempted to define the space allowed by the alanine by evaluating compounds with larger substitutions at the 9-position. The data indicate that position 5.46 contributed to the species difference in 5-HT2A receptor potency observed for a pyrazinoisoindolone compound, resulting in the observation of a significant cardiovascular safety signal.

Here we review progress in mapping RXFP1, RXFP2, and RXFP3 (mRNAs and proteins) and their respective ligands and discuss some of the putative functions for these peptides and receptors that are being explored using receptor-selective agonist and antagonist peptides and receptor and peptide gene deletion mouse strains. Comparative studies reveal an association of RXFP1 and RXFP2 with excitatory neurons but a differential regional or cellular distribution, in contrast to the association of RXFP3 with inhibitory neurons. These studies also reveal differences in the distribution of RXFP1 and RXFP2 in rat and mouse brain, whereas the distribution of RXFP3 is more conserved across these species. Enrichment of RXFP1/2/3 in olfactory, cortical, thalamic, limbic, hypothalamic, midbrain, and pontine circuits suggests a diverse range of modulatory actions for these receptors. For example, experimental evidence in the rat reveals that RXFP1 activation in the amygdala inhibits memory consolidation, RXFP2 activation in striatum produces sniffing behavior, and RXFP3 modulation has effects on feeding and metabolism, the activity of the septohippocampal pathway, and spatial memory. Further studies are now required to reveal additional details of these and other functions linked to relaxin family peptide receptor signaling in mammalian brain and the precise mechanisms involved.

So far, the cerebral cannabinoid-type 1 receptor (CB1R) has only been studied using in vitro, animal model, electrophysiological and post-mortem data. We have used positron emission tomography (PET) using a high-affinity, subtype-selective radioligand, [F-18]MK-9470, to assess the in vivo cerebral CB1R distribution and its variation with healthy aging and gender. Fifty healthy volunteers (25 M/25 F, 18-69 years) underwent [F-18]MK-9470 PET. Parametric [F-18]MK-9470 binding maps were constructed, corrected for partial volume effects and analyzed using statistical parametric mapping in a combined categorical (gender) and covariate (age) design. We found that [F-18]MK-9470 binding to CB1R increased with aging but only in women (p(FWE)<0.051 corrected for multiple comparisons); this was most pronounced in the basal ganglia, lateral temporal cortex and limbic system, especially in the hippocampus. Men showed higher [F-18]MK-9470 binding then women (p<0.001, uncorrected), in clusters of the limbic system and cortico-striatothalamic-cortical circuit. Region-dependent and gender-related upregulation of [F-18]MK-9470 binding with aging is in line with ex vivo findings in rodent studies and may be associated with a changing homeostatic capacity or compensation mechanisms in the ECS that is modulated by sex hormones. In vivo PET of the CB1R will likely improve our understanding of the ECS in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

YM-202074 bound an allosteric site of rat mGIuR(1) with a K-i value of 4.8 +/- 0.37 nM. YM-202074 also inhibited the mGluR(1)-mediated inositol phosphates production in rat cerebellar granule cells with an IC50 value of 8.6 +/- 0.9 nM, while showing selectivity over mGluR(2-7). When YM-202074 was infused intravenously at an initial dose of 20 mg/kg/h for 0.5 h followed by a dose of 5 mg/kg/h for 7.5 h, the free concentration of YM-202074 in the brain rapidly (<12 min) reached approximately 0.3 mu M, reaching a steady-state phase within 1.5 h. We first treated rats such that they developed transient middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. Results clearly demonstrate a dose-dependent improvement of neurological deficit and reduction of the infarct volume in both the hemisphere and cortex when YM-202074 was infused intravenously immediately after occlusion at a dose of 10 or 20 mg/kg/h for 0.5 h followed by a dose of 2.5 or S mg/kg/h for 23.5 h, respectively. Significant neuroprotection was maintained even when the administration of drugs was delayed by up to 2 h following the onset of ischemia. Furthermore, the improvement of neurological deficit and the reduction of infarct volume were sustained for I week following the onset of ischemia. These results suggest that YM-202074 exhibits great potential as a novel neuroprotective agent for the treatment of stroke. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Dehydration increases L-type Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> current in rat supraoptic neurons	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Article							MAGNOCELLULAR NEUROSECRETORY-CELLS; DEPOLARIZING AFTER-POTENTIALS; POLYMERASE CHAIN-REACTION; CALCIUM-CHANNEL SUBTYPES; NUCLEUS IN-VITRO; HYPOTHALAMONEUROHYPOPHYSEAL SYSTEM; OXYTOCIN NEURONS; GENE-EXPRESSION; AXON TERMINALS; AFFERENT EXCITATION	The magnocellular neurosecretory cells of the hypothalamus (MNCs) regulate water balance by releasing vasopressin (VP) and oxytocin (OT) as a function of plasma osmolality. Release is determined largely by the rate and pattern of MNC firing, but sustained increases in osmolality also produce structural adaptations, such as cellular hypertrophy, that may be necessary for maintaining high levels of neuropeptide release. Since increases in Ca2+ current could enhance exocytotic secretion, influence MNC firing patterns, and activate gene transcription and translation, we tested whether Ca2+ currents in MNCs acutely isolated from the supraoptic nucleus (SON) of the hypothalamus are altered by 16-24 h of water deprivation. A comparison of whole-cell patch-clamp recordings demonstrated that dehydration causes a significant increase in the amplitude of current sensitive to the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine (from -56 +/- 6 to -99 +/- 10 pA; P < 0.001) with no apparent change in other components of Ca2+ current. Post-recording immunocytochemical identification showed that this increase in current occurred in both OT- and VP-releasing MNCs. Radioligand binding studies of tissue from the SON showed there is also an increase in the density of binding sites for an L-type Ca2+ channel ligand (from 51.5 +/- 4.8 to 68.1 +/- 4.1 fmol (mg protein)(-1); P < 0.05), suggesting that there was an increase in the number of L-type channels on the plasma membrane of the MNCs or some other cell type in the SON. There were no changes in the measured number of binding sites for an N-type Ca2+ channel ligand. Dehydration was not associated with changes in the levels of mRNA coding for Ca2+ channel alpha(1) subunits. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that a selective increase of L-type Ca2+ current may contribute to the adaptation that occurs in the MNCs during dehydration.

In vitro on rat striatal membrane, [H-3]LBT-999 bound to a single site with a K-d of 9 nM, B-max of 17 pmol/mg protein, and a very high selectivity for the DAT [IC50 for 1-{2-[bis-(4-fluorophenyl)methoxy] ethyl}-4-(3-phenylpropyl) piperazine (GBR 12909) and ( E)-N-(3-iodoprop-2-enyl)-2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4'-methyl-phenyl) nortropane (PE2I): 2.4 and 18 nM, respectively; IC50 for paroxetine, citalopram, N,N-dimethyl-2-(2-amino-4-methylphenyl thio)benzylamine, nisoxetine, and desipramine > 1 mu M]. In vitro on post-mortem human brain sections, LBT-999 bound with high intensity to the caudate-putamen, weakly to the thalamus, and not in the neocortex and cerebellum. This binding was totally abolished in the presence of PE2I. Ex vivo cerebral biodistribution of [C-11] LBT-999 in rats showed striatum/ cerebellum radioactivity ratios of 18 and 25 at 30 and 60 min postinjection, respectively. This accumulation was strongly prevented by preinjection of GBR 12909, whereas paroxetine and nisoxetine had no effect. An in vivo kinetic PET study in three baboons showed a fast and very high uptake in the striatum, with a plateau at 30 min postinjection and a maximal putamen/ cerebellum ratio of 30. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that LBT-999 is a highly promising agent for in vivo exploration of the DAT. This probe is currently labeled with F-18 for further characterizations.

A radioligand for the visualization of sigma receptors could be useful for selective detection of primary tumors and their metastases, and for non-invasive assessment of tumor proliferative status. To this end we evaluated two sigma receptor ligands, [C-11]SA5845 and [C-11]SA4503. in an in vitro study, AH109A hepatoma showed moderate densities of sigma] and sigma(2) receptors, and VX-2 carcinoma showed a high density of sigma(2) receptors: B-max (fmol/mg protein) for sigma(1) vs. sigma(2), 1,700 vs. 1,200 for AH109A hepatoma and 800 vs. 10,000 for VX-2 carcinoma. In a cell growth assay in vitro, neither SA5845 nor SA4503 (<10 mu M) showed any inhibitory effect on proliferation of the AH109A hepatoma cells. In rats, the uptake of [C-11]SA5845 and [C-11]SA4503 in AH109A tissues was accumulated over the first 60 minutes; however, the uptake of both tracers increased by co-injection with haloperidol as a sigma receptor ligand. On the other hand, in the PET studies of rabbits, the uptake of [C-11]SA5845 in the VX-2 carcinoma was relatively higher than that of [C-11]SA4503, because of a much higher density of sigma(2) receptors compared to sigma(1) receptors in the VX-2 tissue, and the uptake of both tracers in the VX-2 tissue was decreased by carrier-loading and pre-treatment with haloperidol ([C-11]SA5845, 53% and 26%, respectively; [C-11]SA4503, 41% and 22%, respectively at 30 minutes after injection). Therefore, [C-11]SA5945 and [C-11]SA4503 may be potential ligands for PET imaging of sigma receptor-rich tumors.

Immunofluorescence staining shows alpha 7 subunit protein expression in virtually every transfected cell. Microautoradiographic analysis identifies I-125-labeled alpha-bungarotoxin (I-Bgt) binding sites corresponding to human alpha 7 (h alpha 7)-nAChRs on the surface of most cells. I-Bgt binds to h alpha 7-nAChRs in membrane fractions with a typical apparent K-D value of similar to 5 nM and B-max value of similar to 1 pmol/mg membrane protein, and 62% of these sites are expressed on the cell surface. Function of heterologously expressed h alpha 7-nAChRs is evident as rapid, transient inward current responses to (-)-nicotine. Nicotine treatment of transfected cells produces dose- and time-dependent increases (up to similar to 100%) in numbers of I-Bgt binding sites. Epibatidine is a useful ligand for studies of nAChRs containing alpha 3 or alpha 4 subunits ( K D values of about 100 or 10 pM, respectively). h alpha 7-nAChRs expressed in transfected SH-EP1 cells also exhibit picomolar affinity binding of H-3-labeled epibatidine (K-D value of similar to 0.6 nM). Studies of several forms of native or heterologously expressed rat or human alpha 7-nAChRs confirm high-affinity and mutually exclusive interaction with both epibatidine and alpha-bungarotoxin. Rank order potencies for drugs acting to compete for binding of either radioligand are similar (methyllycaconitine > dimethylphenyl-piperazinium > nicotine similar to cytisine > carbamylcholine similar to d-tubocurarine). These results demonstrate that transfected SH-EP1 cells are excellent models for studies of heterologously expressed, human alpha 7-nAChRs that exhibit ligand binding and functional properties like native alpha 7-nAChRs and that epibatdine is useful as a probe for human alpha 7-nAChRs.

Although radioligand-binding studies have demonstrated the binding of endothelin-1 (ET-1) to ETAR to be essentially irreversible, ETAR internalize in a ligand-dependent manner, release ET-1, and then recycle to the cell surface. Salicylic acid (SA) reduces ET-1 binding (IC50 = 10 mmol/L) to recombinant ETAR in isolated membranes by promoting dissociation of [I-125]ET-1. In the present study, SA (5 mmol SA/L) did not alter [I-125]ET-1 binding to intact adult rat ventricular myocytes. The lack of effect was not due to internalization of receptor-ligand complexes. However, 100 mmol SA/L significantly reduced [I-125]ET-1 binding to both intact myocytes and isolated membranes. SA induced the phosphorylation p42/44 extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and an unidentified 40-kDa protein on the activating threonine-glutamic acid-tyrosine (T-E-Y) motif. ERK phosphorylation was reduced by a MAP kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor, PD98059. Phosphorylation of p40 was reduced by the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580, but not PD98059. However, inhibition of ERK or p38 MAP kinases did not alter the ability of 100 mmol SA/L to induce dissociation of [125 I]ET-L These results suggest that, in the ventricular myocyte, salicylic acid alters the kinetics of ET-1 binding. The results also suggest an allosteric binding site may be present that modulates the dissociation of ET-1 receptor-ligand complexes in response to an as-of-yet unidentified mediator.

In the present paper, we report the first cloning, 3D (threedimensional) modelling, pharmacological characterization and tissue distribution of two melanocortin (MC) receptors in rainbow trout. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that these receptors are orthologues of the human MC4 and MC5 receptors. We created 3D molecular models of these rainbow trout receptors and their human counterparts. These models suggest greater divergence between the two human receptors than between their rainbow trout counterparts. The pharmacological analyses demonstrated that ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) had surprisingly high affinity for the rainbow trout MC4 and MC5 receptors, whereas alpha-, beta- and gamma-MSH (melanocyte-stimulating hormone) had lower affinity. In second-messenger studies, the cyclic MSH analogues MTII and SHU9119 acted as potent agonist and antagonist respectively at the rainbow trout MC4 receptor, indicating that these ligands are suitable for physiological studies in rainbow trout. Interestingly, we found that the rainbow trout MC4 receptor has a natural high-affinity binding site for zinc ions (0.5 muM) indicating that zinc may play an evolutionary conserved role at this receptor. Reverse transcription PCR indicates that the rainbow trout receptors are expressed both in peripheral tissues and in the central nervous system, including the telencephalon, optic tectum and hypothalamus. Overall, this analysis indicates that the rainbow trout MC4 and MC5 receptors have more in common than their mammalian counterparts, which may suggest that these two receptors have a closer evolutionary relationship than the other MC receptor subtypes.

This study investigated 5-HT1A receptor occupancy by the 5-HT1A agonist drugs flesinoxan (a highly selective probe for the 5-HT1A receptor) and ziprasidone (a novel atypical antipsychotic drug). Using a within-subject design, 14 healthy volunteers each received two positron emission tomography scans using the selective 5-HT1A antagonist radiotracer [C-11]WAY-100635. One scan constituted a baseline, while the other followed either 1 mg flesinoxan or 40 mg ziprasidone orally. In addition, rats were pretreated with intravenous flesinoxan at doses ranging from 0.001 to 5 mg/kg then [C-11]WAY-100635 binding measured ex vivo. Cerebral cortical and hippocampal regions of interest, and cerebellar reference regions were sampled to estimate 5-HT1A receptor occupancy ( inferred from reductions in specific radioligand binding). In man, occupancy was not significant despite volunteers experiencing side effects consistent with central serotonergic activity. The mean cerebral cortex occupancy (+/-1SD) for flesinoxan was 8.7% (+/-13%), and for ziprasidone 4.6% (+/-17%). However, in rats, flesinoxan achieved significant and dose-related occupancy (17-57%) at 0.25 mg/kg and above. We conclude that 5-HT1A receptor agonists produce detectable occupancy only at higher doses that would produce unacceptable levels of side effects in man, although lower doses are sufficient to produce pharmacological effects. The development of agonist radiotracers may increase the sensitivity of detecting agonist binding, as 5-HT1A antagonists bind equally to low- and high-affinity receptor states, while agonists bind preferentially to the high-affinity state.

Adult animals of both sexes were captured in their habitat and were kept under a natural photoperiod. For light and electron microscopic studies the viscachas were sacrificed by decapitation at 08:00, 16:00, and 24:00 hr. A computer-assisted image analysis system was used to measure the thickness of the complete retina, the photoreceptor layer, the rod outer and inner segments, and the outer nuclear layer. The daily variation in 2- [I-125] -iodomelatonin binding sites was followed during a 24-hr light-dark cycle, the animals being sacrificed at six time points. The parameters studied showed significant variations throughout the 24-hr period. Maximal specific binding, lysosomal content in the pigment epithelium, and photoreceptor layer outer segment thicknesses were observed at 24:00 h-r. Close contact between photoreceptor membranes and microvilli of the pigment epithelium was observed at 08:00 and 16:00 hr. Moreover, the minimal outer segment thickness at 16:00 hr was accompanied by a scarcity of dense bodies, such as lysosomes, a maximum dispersion of melanin pigment granules, and a minimum density of radioligand binding sites. Therefore, in the retina of the viscacha, we suggest that the interaction between melatonin and specific sites could be one of the factors or causes that participate in the regulation of the daily morphological changes observed in viscacha.

We now report the chromatographic resolution of ACPA and (RS)-2-amino-3-(3-carboxy-4-isoxazolyl)propionic acid (demethyl-ACPA) using a Sumichiral OA-5000 column. The configuration of the enantiomers of both compounds have been assigned based on X-ray crystallographic analyses, supported by circular dichroism spectra and elution orders on chiral HPLC columns. Furthermore, the enantiopharmacology of ACPA and domethyl-ACPA was investigated using radioligand binding and cortical wedge electrophysiological assay systems and cloned metabotropic Glu receptors. (S)-ACPA showed high affinity in AMPA binding (IC50 = 0.025 muM), low affinity in kainic acid binding (IC50 = 3.6 muM), and potent AMPA receptor agonist activity on cortical neurons (EC50 = 0.25 muM), whereas (R)-ACPA was essentially inactive. Like (S)-ACPA, (S)-demethyl-ACPA displayed high AMPA receptor affinity (IC50 = 0.039 muM), but was found to be a relatively weak AMPA receptor agonist (EC50 = 12 muM). The stereoselectivity observed for demethyl-ACPA was high when based on AMPA receptor affinity (eudismic ratio = 250), but low when based on electrophysiological activity (eudismic ratio = 10). (R)-Demethyl-ACPA also possessed a weak NMDA receptor antagonist activity (IC50 = 220 muM), Among the enantiomers tested, only (S)-demethyl-ACPA showed activity at metabotropic receptors, being a weak antagonist at the mGlu(2) receptor subtype (K-B = 148 muM).

In this study a novel fusion protein combining the entire GAD65 molecule with the 40 kDa intracellular domain of IA-2 (GAD-IA-2) was constructed to detect autoantibodies to both antigens by one single assay. For the same purpose a truncated version of this fusion protein which contained the entire GAD65 linked to the 203 carboxy-terminal amino acids of IA-2 (GAD-dIA-2) was made. A panel of 34 diabetic sera which represented unequivocally positive or negative antibody responses to GAD65 and/or IA-2 as well as 20 serum samples from healthy controls were tested in a radioligand binding assay with the constructed fusion proteins as antigens. Nine of the samples from patients with type 1 diabetes reacted with GAD65 while being negative for IA-2. Six sera were positive for IA-2 only, 11 were double positive, and 8 negative for both antibodies using the standard in vitro transcription translation assay with single antigens. The full-length, as well as the truncated fusion protein detected all samples positive for antibodies either to GAD65 or IA-2 or both, except for one GAD65 antibody positive sample. All samples from healthy controls tested negative in all assays. We conclude that the principle of a combinatorial molecule where a fusion protein expresses both GAD65 and IA-2 epitopes is feasible, and such a fusion protein can be used instead of the single antigens to reduce time and costs of large-scale screening for clinical purposes.

The mechanisms involved in the loss of physiological day-night variation are still unclear, but a continuously active sympathetic nervous system could play a role. The present study evaluated long-term consequences of rat heart failure on cardiovascular circadian patterns in vivo, and on density and function of cardiac beta-adrenoceptor subtypes in vitro, as a marker of cardiac adrenergic drive. Methods: Heart failure in rats was induced by coronary artery ligation leading to infarct sizes of >30% of left ventricular circumference. Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored for 10 weeks after infarction using radiotelemetry. Density and function of cardiac beta(1) and beta(2)-adrenoceptors were measured by radioligand binding and adenylyl cyclase stimulation. Results: During the activity period at night blood pressure and heart rate were lower in rats with heart failure than in sham controls, leading to reduced night-day variation in the heart failure group. Depression of circadian rhythmicity in blood pressure was found over the whole study period, while that in heart rate occurred with a lag-time of several weeks. In failing left ventricles beta-adrenoceptors showed reduced high affinity agonist binding, a shift in the beta(1):beta(2) ratio towards the beta(2)-subtype, and decreased beta(1)-adrenergic stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. In right ventricles no differences were found between failing and control rats. The blunted nocturnal increase in blood pressure and heart rate as well as beta(1)-adrenergic desensitization were correlated with the severity of left ventricular dysfunction. Conclusions: Heart failure in rats leads to disturbed circadian patterns in blood pressure and heart rate, and to desensitization of cardiac beta(1)-adrenoceptors, indicating chronic sympathetic overactivity.

In this study, substrate recognition was studied via the inhibition of binding of [H-3]WIN 35,428 [2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-fluorophenyl)[H-3]tropane], a cocaine analogue, to the human dopamine transporter in human embryonic kidney 243 cells. D-Amphetamine was the most potent inhibitor, followed by p-tyramine and, finally, dl-octopamine; respective affinities at 150 mM Na+ and 140 mM Cl- were 5.5, 26, and 220 mu M. For each substrate, the decrease in the affinity with increasing [K+] could be fitted to a competitive model involving the same inhibitory cation site (site 1) overlapping with the substrate domain as reported by us previously for dopamine. K+ binds to this site with an apparent affinity, averaged across substrates, of 9, 24, 66, 99, and 134 mM at 2, 10, 60, 150, and 300 mu M Na+, respectively. In general, increasing [Na+] attenuated the inhibitory effect of K+ in a manner that deviated from linearity, which could be modeled by a distal site for Na+, linked to site 1 by negative allosterism. The presence of Cl- did not affect the binding of K+ to site 1. Models assuming low binding of substrate in the absence of Na+ did not provide fits as good as models in which substrate binds in the absence of Na+ with appreciable affinity. The binding of dl-octopamine and p-tyramine was strongly inhibited by Na+, and stimulated by Cl- only at high [Na+] (300 mM), consonant with a stimulatory action of Cl- occurring through Na+ disinhibition.

An influence of these compounds on food intake and sleep pattern has been also shown. The neuroendocrine activities of GHRPs are mediated by specific receptors subtypes that have been identified in the pituitary gland, hypothalamus and various extra-hypothalamic brain regions with I-125-Tyr-Ala-hexarelin, an octapeptide of the GHRP family. In addition, GHRP receptors were also present in different peripheral tissues such as heart, adrenal, ovary, testis, lung and skeletal muscle, with a density significantly higher than that found in the hypothalamo-pituitary system. A remarkable specific I-125-Tyr-Ala-hexarelin binding was observed in the human cardiovascular system where the highest binding levels were detected in ventricles, followed by atria, aorta, coronaries, carotid, endocardium and vena cava. The binding of the radioligand to cardiac membranes was inhibited by unlabeled Tyr Ala hexare lin and hexarelin as well as by GHRP-6, GHRP-1 and GHRP-2 but not by MK-677, a non peptidyl GHRP analog. In other experiments on H9c2 myocytes, a fetal cardiomyocytes-derived cell line, specific GHRP binding was found and hexarelin showed an anti-apoptotic activity. On the other hand, in vivo studies in animals and in humans showed that GHRPs possess direct cardiotropic actions. In fact, hexarelin protects from ischemia-induced myocardial damage in aged and GH deficient rats while hexarelin shows a positive inotropic effect in normal subjects as well as in patients with GH deficiency. In conclusion, GHRPs possess extra-neuroendocrine biological activity and, particularly, show direct GH-independent cardiotropic effects.

C2-Arylethynyl-linkedmacrocycle 19 was more A(3)AR-selective than2-ether-linked macrocycle 12 (both 5 & PRIME;-methylamides,human (h) A(3)AR affinities (K (i)): 22.1 and 25.8 nM, respectively), with lower mouse A(3)AR affinities. Functional hA(3)AR comparison of two setsof open/closed analogues in & beta;-arrestin2 and G(i/o) proteinassays showed certain signaling preferences divergent from referenceagonist Cl-IB-MECA 1. The potencies of 1 at all three G & alpha;(i) isoforms were slightly less thanits hA(3)AR binding affinity (K (i): 1.4 nM), while the G & alpha;(i1) and G & alpha;(i2) potencies of macrocycle 12 were roughly an order ofmagnitude higher than its radioligand binding affinity. G & alpha;(i2)-coupling was enhanced in macrocycle 12 (EC50 2.56 nM, & SIM;40% greater maximal efficacy than 1). Di-O-allyl precursor 18 cyclized to form 19, increasing the G & alpha;(i1) potency by 7.5-fold.The macrocycles 12 and 19 and their openprecursors 11 and 18 potently stimulated & beta;-arrestin2 recruitment, with EC50 values (nM) of5.17, 4.36, 1.30, and 4.35, respectively, and with nearly 50% greaterefficacy compared to 1. This example of macrocyclizationaltering the coupling pathways of small-molecule (nonpeptide) GPCRagonists is the first for potent and selective macrocyclic AR agonists.These initial macrocyclic derivatives can serve as a guide for thefuture design of macrocyclic AR agonists displaying unanticipatedpharmacology.

Exogenously-induced 40 Hz gamma oscillations have been showing to reduce A beta and p-Tau deposition presumably via microglia activation in AD mouse models. Objective: We aimed to translate preclinical data on gamma-induction in AD patients by means of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). Methods: Four participants with mild-to-moderate AD received 1 h of daily 40 Hz (gamma) tACS for 4 weeks (Monday to Friday) targeting the bitemporal lobes (20 h treatment duration). Participant underwent A beta, p-Tau, and microglia PET imaging with [C-11]-PiB, [F-18]-FTP, and [C-11]-PBR28 respectively, before and after the intervention along with electrophysiological assessment. Results: No adverse events were reported, and an increase in gamma spectral power on EEG was observed after the treatment. [F-18] _FTP PET revealed a significant decrease over 2% of p-Tau burden in 3/4 patients following the tACS treatment, primarily involving the temporal lobe regions targeted by tACS and especially mesial regions (e.g., entorhinal cortex). The amount of intracerebral Ap as measured by [C-11] - PiB was not significantly influenced by tACS, whereas 1/4 reported a significant decrease of microglia activation as measured by [C-11]-PBR28. Conclusion: tACS seems to represent a safe and feasible option for gamma induction in AD patients, with preliminary evidence of a possible effect on protein clearance partially mimicking what is observed in animal models. Longer interventions and placebo control conditions are needed to fully evaluate the potential for tACS to slow disease progression.

Snake Toxins Labeled by Green Fluorescent Protein or Its Synthetic Chromophore are New Probes for Nicotinic acetylcholine Receptors	FRONTIERS IN MOLECULAR BIOSCIENCES			English	Article						nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; acetylcholine-binding protein; alpha-cobratoxin; azemiopsin; fluorescent protein; fluorescent toxin; ion channel; peptide toxin	BLACK MAMBA VENOM; ALPHA-BUNGAROTOXIN; ION CHANNELS; NEUROTOXINS; DERIVATIVES; COBRATOXIN; SUBUNITS; NEURONS; SYSTEM; LIGAND	Fluorescence can be exploited to monitor intermolecular interactions in real time and at a resolution up to a single molecule. It is a method of choice to study ligand-receptor interactions. However, at least one of the interacting molecules should possess good fluorescence characteristics, which can be achieved by the introduction of a fluorescent label. Gene constructs with green fluorescent protein (GFP) are widely used to follow the expression of the respective fusion proteins and monitor their function. Recently, a small synthetic analogue of GFP chromophore (p-HOBDI-BF2) was successfully used for tagging DNA molecules, so we decided to test its applicability as a potential fluorescent label for proteins and peptides. This was done on alpha-cobratoxin (alpha-CbTx), a three-finger protein used as a molecular marker of muscle-type, neuronal alpha 7 and alpha 9/alpha 10 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), as well as on azemiopsin, a linear peptide neurotoxin selectively inhibiting muscle-type nAChRs. An activated N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of p-HOBDI-BF2 was prepared and utilized for toxin labeling. For comparison we used a recombinant alpha-CbTx fused with a full-length GFP prepared by expression of a chimeric gene. The structure of modified toxins was confirmed by mass spectrometry and their activity was characterized by competition with iodinated alpha-bungarotoxin in radioligand assay with respective receptor preparations, as well as by thermophoresis. With the tested protein and peptide neurotoxins, introduction of the synthetic GFP chromophore induced considerably lower decrease in their affinity for the receptors as compared with full-length GFP attachment. The obtained fluorescent derivatives were used for nAChR visualization in tissue slices and cell cultures.

Generalized synaptic degeneration may contribute to dysfunction and cognitive decline in Lewy body dementias, but in vivo evidence is lacking. Objective The objective of this study was to assess the density of synapses in non-demented PD (nPD) subjects (N = 21), patients with PD-dementia or Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) (N = 13), and age-matched healthy controls (N = 15). Method Using in vivo PET imaging and the novel synaptic-vesicle-glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) radioligand [11C]UCB-J, SUVR-1 values were obtained for 12 pre-defined regions. Volumes-of-interest were defined on MRI T1 scans. Voxel-level between-group comparisons of [11C]UCB-J SUVR-1 were performed. All subjects underwent neuropsychological assessment. Correlations between [11C]UCB- J PET and domain-specific cognitive functioning were examined. Results nPD patients only demonstrated significantly reduced SUVR-1 values in the substantia nigra (SN) compared to HC. DLB/PDD patients demonstrated reduced SUVR-1 values in SN and all cortical VOIs except for the hippocampus and amygdala. The voxel-based analysis supported the VOI results. Significant correlation was seen between middle frontal gyrus [11C]UCB-J SUVR-1 and performance on tests of executive function. Conclusion Widespread cortical reduction of synaptic density was documented in a cohort of DLB/PDD subjects using in vivo [11C]UCB-J PET. Our study confirms previously reported synaptic loss in SN of nPD patients. [11C]UCB-J binding in selected cortical VOIs of the DLB/PDD patients correlated with their levels of cognitive function across relevant neuropsychological domains. These findings suggest that the loss of synaptic density contributes to cognitive impairment in nPD and DLB/PDD.

Imaging of translocator protein upregulation is selective for pro-inflammatory polarized astrocytes and microglia	GLIA			English	Article						astrocytes; brain inflammation; microglia; PET; translocator protein	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; 18 KDA; BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTORS; INCREASED EXPRESSION; FUNCTIONAL-CHARACTERIZATION; MEDIATED F-18-FLUORINATION; PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE; MANNOSE RECEPTOR; MOUSE MODEL; ACTIVATION	Translocator protein (TSPO) expression is increased in activated glia, and has been used as a marker of neuroinflammation in PET imaging. However, the extent to which TSPO upregulation reflects a pro- or anti-inflammatory phenotype remains unclear. Our aim was to determine whether TSPO upregulation in astrocytes and microglia/macrophages is limited to a specific inflammatory phenotype. TSPO upregulation was assessed by flow cytometry in cultured astrocytes, microglia, and macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), or interleukin-4 (Il-4). Subsequently, mice were injected intracerebrally with either a TNF-inducing adenovirus (AdTNF) or IL-4. Glial expression of TSPO and pro-/anti-inflammatory markers was assessed by immunohistochemistry/fluorescence and flow cytometry. Finally, AdTNF or IL-4 injected mice underwent PET imaging with injection of the TSPO radioligand F-18-DPA-713, followed by ex vivo autoradiography. TSPO expression was significantly increased in pro-inflammatory microglia/macrophages and astrocytes both in vitro, and in vivo after AdTNF injection (p < .001 vs. control hemisphere), determined both histologically and by FACS. Both PET imaging and autoradiography revealed a significant (p < .001) increase in F-18-DPA-713 binding in the ipsilateral hemisphere of AdTNF-injected mice. In contrast, no increase in either TSPO expression assessed histologically and by FACS, or ligand binding by PET/autoradiography was observed after IL-4 injection. Taken together, these results suggest that TSPO imaging specifically reveals the pro-inflammatory population of activated glial cells in the brain in response to inflammatory stimuli. Since the inflammatory phenotype of glial cells is critical to their role in neurological disease, these findings may enhance the utility and application of TSPO imaging.

Functional TSPO polymorphism predicts variance in the diurnal cortisol rhythm in bipolar disorder	PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						Bipolar disorder; Biomarker; Stress; Cortisol; Immune; Genetics; TSPO; rs6971; Alcohol use disorder; Variance factor; Diurnal rhythm; HPA axis; Precision medicine	PROTEIN 18 KDA; PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; SOCIAL STRESS TEST; SALIVARY CORTISOL; RATING-SCALE; DEPRESSION; BINDING; INFLAMMATION; RADIOLIGAND	Introduction: Psychosocial stress contributes to onset/exacerbation of mood episodes and alcohol use, suggesting dysregulated diurnal cortisol rhythms underlie episodic exacerbations in Bipolar Disorder (BD). However, mechanisms underlying dysregulated HPA rhythms in BD and alcohol use disorders (AUD) are understudied. Knowledge of associated variance factors have great clinical translational potential by facilitating development of strategies to reduce stress-related relapse in BD and AUD. Evidence suggests structural changes to mitochondria) translocator protein (TSPO) (a regulator of steroid synthesis) due to the single nucleotide polymorphism rs6971, may explain much of this variance. However, whether rs6971 is associated with abnormal HPA rhythms and clinical exacerbation in humans is unknown. Methods: To show this common TSPO polymorphism impacts HPA rhythms in BD, we tested whether rs6971 (dichotomized: presence/absence of polymorphism) predicted variance in diurnal cortisol rhythm (saliva: morning and evening for 3 days) in 107 BD (50 with and 57 without AUD) and 28 healthy volunteers of similar age and ethno-demographic distribution. Results: Repeated measures ANOVA confirmed effects BD (F-5,F-525 = 3.0, p = 0.010) and AUD (F-5,F-525 = 2.9, p = 0.012), but not TSPO polymorphism (p > 0.05). Interactions were confirmed for TSPO x BD (F-5,F-525 = 3.9, p = 0.002) and for TSPO x AUD (F-5,F-525 = 2.8, p = 0.017). Discussion We identified differences in diurnal cortisol rhythm depending on presence/absence of common TSPO polymorphism in BD volunteers with or without AUD and healthy volunteers. These results have wide ranging implications but further validation is needed prior to optimal clinical translation.

Neuroimaging of translocator protein in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: a pilot study using [<SUP>11</SUP>C]DPA-713 positron emission tomography	LUPUS			English	Article						Brain; cerebellum; cognitive impairment; glial cell activation; hippocampus; lupus; mitochondria; mitochondrial translocator protein; molecular imaging; neurocognitive deficits; positron emission tomography; systemic lupus erythematosus; translocator protein	PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; RESOLUTION RESEARCH TOMOGRAPH; 18 KDA TSPO; NEUROPSYCHIATRIC LUPUS; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; PET RADIOLIGAND; HUMAN BRAIN; INFLAMMATION; PATHOLOGY; BINDING	Objective Inflammation secondary to autoantibody-mediated effects occurring in multiple organs is a hallmark of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The inflammatory response to SLE-mediated damage in brain parenchyma has been postulated in both normal and cognitively impaired individuals. Our goal is to use molecular imaging to investigate the distribution within the brain of the mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO) that is upregulated during glial cell activation, and is considered as a marker of brain injury and repair. Methods We sought to characterize TSPO distribution in the brain of SLE patients using positron emission tomography (PET) and [C-11]DPA-713 (DPA), a radiopharmaceutical that targets TSPO. We imaged 11 healthy controls and 10 patients with SLE (years of diagnosis: 13.07.7), all between the ages of 22 and 52. Results: Among the nine brain regions studied, no statistically significant increases in DPA binding were observed in SLE. Instead, there was a significant decrease in TSPO distribution in the cerebellum and hippocampus of SLE patients, as compared to healthy controls. Such decreases were most significant in cognitively normal SLE subjects, but showed pseudo-normalization in those with cognitive impairment, due to higher cerebellar and hippocampal DPA binding in the cognitively impaired (versus normal) SLE brain. Conclusions Results from this pilot study suggest a link between diminished regional TSPO expression in the brain of patients with SLE, as well as possible glial cell activation within the cerebellum and hippocampus of cognitively impaired individuals with SLE.

With the aim to identify a safer approach for the treatment of anxiety, we investigated, in mice, the anxiolytic-like properties of a novel A(1)AR positive allosteric modulator, TRR469. Acute administration of TRR469 (0.3-3 mg/kg) resulted in robust anxiolytic-like effects in the elevated plus maze, the dark/light box, the open field and the marble burying tests. The magnitude of the anxiolytic action of TRR469 was comparable to that obtained with benzodiazepine diazepam (1 mg/kg). The use of the A(1)AR antagonist DPCPX (3 mg/kg) suggested that the effects of TRR469 were mediated by this receptor subtype. In contrast to diazepam, the novel positive allosteric modulator did not potentiate the sedative effect of ethanol (3.5 g/kg) evaluated by the loss of righting reflex. While diazepam produced motor coordination impairment in the rotarod test, this effect being enhanced by the presence of ethanol (1.5 g/kg), TRR469 did not elicit locomotor disturbances either when administered alone or in the presence of ethanol. In vitro, TRR469 was able to increase the number of A(1)AR recognizable by the agonist radioligand [H-3]-CCPA in mouse brain regions involved in emotional processes. TRR469 markedly increased the affinity of the agonist CCPA, suggesting the capability, in vivo, to increase the affinity of endogenous adenosine. Taken together, these findings indicate that the positive allosteric modulation of A(1)AR may represent a promising approach for the treatment of anxiety-related disorders. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Studies with [C-11]-D-deprenyl showed robust uptake in peripheral painful sites of patients with rheumatoid arthritis or chronic whiplash injury. The mechanism of preferential D-deprenyl uptake is not yet known, but the existence of a specific binding site was proposed. Thus, in the present study, we sought to identify the binding site for D-deprenyl and verify the hypothesis about the possibility of monoamine oxidase enzymes as major targets for this molecule. Main methods: A high-throughput analysis of D-deprenyl activity towards 165 G-protein coupled receptors and 84 enzyme targets was performed. Additionally, binding studies were used to verify the competition of [H-3]D-deprenyl with ligands specific for targets identified in the high-throughput screen. Key findings: Our high-throughput investigation identified monoamine oxidase-B, monoamine oxidase-A and angiotensin converting enzyme as potential targets for D-deprenyl. Further competitive [3H] D-deprenyl binding studies with specific inhibitors identified monoamine oxidase-B as the major binding site. No evident high-affinity hits were identified among G-protein coupled receptors. Significance: Our study was the first to utilize a high-throughput screening approach to identify putative D-deprenyl targets. It verified 249 candidate proteins and confirmed the role of monoamine oxidase - B in D-deprenyl binding. Our results add knowledge about the possible mechanism of D-deprenyl binding, which might aid in explaining the increased uptake of this compound in peripheral inflammation. Monoamine oxidase-B will be further investigated in future studies utilizing human inflamed synovium. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

GPER-Targeted, <SUP>99m</SUP>Tc-Labeled, Nonsteroidal Ligands Demonstrate Selective Tumor Imaging and <i>In Vivo</i> Estrogen Binding	MOLECULAR CANCER RESEARCH			English	Article							PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR; BREAST-CANCER; GPR30; TAMOXIFEN; CELLS; 17-BETA-ESTRADIOL; HYDROXYTAMOXIFEN; MODULATION; GPER/GPR30; EXPRESSION	Our understanding of estrogen (17 beta-estradiol, E2) receptor biology has evolved in recent years with the discovery and characterization of a 7-transmembrane-spanning G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER/GPR30) and the development of GPER-selective functional chemical probes. GPER is highly expressed in certain breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancers, establishing the importance of noninvasive methods to evaluate GPER expression in vivo. Here, we developed Tc-99m-labeled GPER ligands to demonstrate the in vivo status of GPER as an estrogen receptor (ER) and for GPER visualization in whole animals. A series of Tc-99m(I)-labeled nonsteroidal tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c] quinolone derivatives was synthesized utilizing pyridin-2-yl hydrazine and picolylamine chelates. Radioligand receptor binding studies revealed binding affinities in the 10 to 30 nmol/L range. Cell signaling assays previously demonstrated that derivatives retaining a ketone functionality displayed agonist properties, whereas those lacking such a hydrogen bond acceptor were antagonists. In vivo biodistribution and imaging studies performed on mice bearing human endometrial and breast cancer cell xenografts yielded significant tumor uptake (0.4-1.1%ID/g). Blocking studies revealed specific uptake in multiple organs (adrenals, uterus, and mammary tissue), as well as tumor uptake with similar levels of competition by E2 and G-1, a GPER-selective agonist. In conclusion, we synthesized and evaluated a series of first-generation Tc-99m-labeled GPER-specific radioligands, demonstrating GPER as an estrogen-binding receptor for the first time in vivo using competitive binding principles, and establishing the utility of such ligands as tumor imaging agents. These results warrant further investigation into the role of GPER in estrogen-mediated carcinogenesis and as a target for diagnostic/therapeutic/image-guided drug delivery.

Here we investigated whether A(1)R occupancy by nonradioactive agonists and antagonists can be assessed with this technique. Methods: Small-animal PET scans with arterial blood sampling were obtained for 4 groups of isoflurane-anesthetized Wistar rats: controls (n = 7); pretreated with a centrally active A(1)R agonist, N-6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA; 0.25 mg/kg intraperitoneally; dissociation constant, 0.48 nM; n = 7); pretreated with a moderate dose of caffeine (antagonist for A1Rs and adenosine A(2A) receptors; 4 mg/kg intraperitoneally; dissociation constant, 11 mu M; n = 6); and pretreated with a high dose of caffeine (40 mg/kg intraperitoneally; n = 6). Results: The administration of CPA resulted in a strong reduction (>50%) in the heart rate, and caffeine administration resulted in a small increase (10%- 15%). A caffeine dose of 4 mg/kg (n = 6) resulted in 65.9% A(1)R occupancy, and a dose of 40 mg/kg (n = 6) resulted in 98.5% occupancy (calculated from a modified Lassen plot). However, the administration of CPA resulted in an increase in C-11-MPDX binding in the brain. Conclusion: Small-animal PET with C-11-MPDX can be used to assess antagonist but not agonist binding at A1Rs. Changes in tracer uptake after the administration of CPA resembled previously reported changes induced by treatment of rats with ethanol and an adenosine kinase inhibitor (ABT702). Thus, the administration of an exogenous agonist or increasing the level of an endogenous agonist have similar effects. Agonists and antagonists may bind to different sites on the A(1)R protein having allosteric interactions.

Animal research emphasizes the role of dopaminergic (DA) mesocorticolimbic pathways in reward learning, but few studies have evaluated extrastriatal DA functioning in humans. The purpose of this study was to examine presynaptic DA release in extrastriatal regions of the reward circuit by measuring displacement of the high affinity D2/D3 radioligand [18F]Fallypride during a reward task. Design: Ten healthy volunteers underwent a [18F]Fallypride positron emission tomography protocol while performing a reward task, allowing us to assess participants' ability to modulate behavior as a function of reward. DA receptor ligand displacement was correlated with task performance and self-reported anhedonia. Observations: Parametric t-maps revealed significant decrease in [18F]Fallypride binding in the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC), ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), indicating endogenous DA release in these regions. Increasing anhedonic symptoms correlated with DA release in the left vmPFC, left dACC, and right dACC emerged (all r's > 0.65, P's < 0.05). Similarly, reduced reward learning correlated with higher DA release in left vmPFC, right vmPFC, and left dACC (all r's < 0.64, P's < 0.05). Left dACC (r = 0.66, P = 0.04) and left vmPFC (r = 0.74, P = 0.01) DA release showed a significant positive correlation with impaired tendency to modulate behavior as a function of prior positive reinforcements. Conclusions: These findings support the hypothesis that DA release in mOFC, vmPFC, and dACC regions plays an important role in reinforcement learning in the human brain. Hum Brain Mapp, 2013.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that stimulation of adenosine receptors on cardiac Sca-1(+) cells up-regulates their secretion of proangiogenic factors. We found that Sca-1 is expressed in subsets of mouse cardiac stromal CD31(-) and endothelial CD31(+) cells. The population of Sca1(+) CD31(+) endothelial cells was significantly reduced, whereas the population of Sca-1(+) CD31(-) stromal cells was increased 1 week after myocardial infarction, indicating their relative functional importance in this pathophysiological process. An increase in adenosine levels in adenosine deaminase-deficient mice in vivo significantly augmented vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production in cardiac Sca-1(+) CD31(-) stromal cells but not in Sca-1(+) CD31(+) endothelial cells. We found that mouse cardiac Sca-1(+) CD31(-) stromal cells predominantly express mRNA encoding A(2B) adenosine receptors. Stimulation of adenosine receptors significantly increased interleukin (IL)-6, CXCL1 (a mouse ortholog of human IL-8), and VEGF release from these cells. Using conditionally immortalized Sca1(+) CD31(-) stromal cells obtained from wild-type and A(2B) receptor knockout mouse hearts, we demonstrated that A(2B) receptors are essential for adenosine-dependent up-regulation of their paracrine functions. We found that the human heart also harbors a population of stromal cells similar to the mouse cardiac Sca-1(+) CD31(-) stromal cells that increase release of IL-6, IL-8, and VEGF in response to A(2B) receptor stimulation. Thus, our study identified A(2B) adenosine receptors on cardiac stromal cells as potential targets for up-regulation of proangiogenic factors in the ischemic heart.

The metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 mediates sensitivity to the sedative properties of ethanol	PHARMACOGENETICS AND GENOMICS			English	Article						alcohol; loss of righting reflex; metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5; 2-methyl-6-(phenylethyl)-pyridine; quantitative complementation	QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI; SHORT-SLEEP MICE; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; PREFERRING P RATS; ANTAGONIST MPEP; LOW-LEVEL; IN-VIVO; NOREPINEPHRINE TRANSPORTER; C57BL/6J MICE; MGLUR5	Objective Inbred long-sleep and short-sleep mice (ILS and ISS) were selectively bred for differential sensitivity to the sedative effects of ethanol. Lines of mice derived from these progenitors have been used to identify several quantitative trait loci (QTLs) mediating loss of the righting reflex due to ethanol (LORE). This study investigated the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5) as a candidate gene underlying Lore7, a QTL mediating differential LORE sensitivity. Methods We used knockout mice, a quantitative complementation test, pharmacological antagonism of mGluR5, real-time quantitative PCR, radioligand binding, DNA sequencing, and bioinformatics to examine the role of mGluR5 in ethanol-induced sedation. Results mGluR5 knockout mice had a significantly longer LORE duration than wildtype controls. Administration of the mGluR5 antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethyl)-pyridine (MPEP) had differential effects on LORE in ILS and ISS mice. A quantitative complementation test also supported mGluR5 mediating LORE. Two intronic single-nucleotide polymorphisms in mGluR5 were highly correlated with LORE in recombinant inbred mice derived from a cross between ILS and ISS (LXS RIs). Differences in mGluR5 mRNA level and receptor density were observed between ILS and ISS in distinct brain regions. Finally, data from WebQTL showed that mGluR5 expression was highly correlated with several LORE phenotypes in the LXS RIs. Conclusion Altogether, this data provides convincing evidence that mGluR5 mediates differential sensitivity to the sedative effects of ethanol. Studies from the human literature have also identified mGluR5 as a potential candidate gene for ethanol sensitivity.

In order to keep the animals in a restricted position during imaging, anaesthesia is in many instances inevitable. Using small animal PET and ex vivo autoradiography, we examined the influence of pentobarbital and isoflurane anaesthesia on the rat brain uptake of [F-18]MK-9470, a radioligand for the type 1 cannabinoid receptor. PET imaging was performed on adult Wistar rats under pentobarbital (n = 6) and isoflurane anaesthesia (n = 7), and under control conditions (free moving during tracer uptake, n = 8). Parametric PET images were generated, anatomically standardized and analysed by voxel-based Statistical Parametric Mapping and a predefined volume of interest approach. Immediately after in vivo PET, brains were processed for ex vivo autoradiography using manually placed regions of interest. An extra group (n = 6) was included ex vivo, in which animals were intravenously injected without the use of anaesthetics. Using in vivo and ex vivo molecular imaging techniques, no significant changes in absolute [F-18]MK-9470 uptake were present in the brain of pentobarbital and isoflurane rats as compared to control conditions. Relative [F-18]MK-9470 uptake PET values obtained applying global scaling were, however, decreased in the cortex under both anaesthetics (pentobarbital: -13.3 +/- 1.4%; isoflurane -8.7 +/- 3.1%), while an increase was seen in the cerebellum by 13.5 +/- 4.0% and 13.9 +/- 4.1% under pentobarbital and isoflurane, respectively. Ex vivo results were in agreement with in vivo findings. These findings suggest a similar, regionally specific interference of pentobarbital and isoflurane anaesthesia with in vivo CB1 receptor imaging using [F-18]MK-9470.

Interaction of benzylidene-anabaseine analogues with agonist and allosteric sites on muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptors	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; benzylidine-anabaseine; partial agonist; non-competitive antagonist; DMXBA; GTS-21; 4OH-DMXBA; 4OH-GTS-21; PCP	ANTAGONIST BINDING-SITES; MOLECULAR-MECHANISMS; SELECTIVE AGONISTS; LOCAL-ANESTHETICS; GTS-21; INHIBITION; PHARMACOKINETICS; IDENTIFICATION; MEMBRANES; LOCATION	Benzylidene-anabaseines (BAs) are partial agonists of the alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) but their mechanism(s) of action are unknown. Our study explores several possibilities, including direct interactions of BAs with the nAChR channel. Functional and radioligand-binding assays were used to examine the interaction of two BA analogues, 3-(2,4-dimethoxybenzylidene)-anabaseine (DMXBA) and its primary metabolite 3-(4-hydroxy-2-methoxybenzylidene)-anabaseine (4OH-DMXBA) with both agonist and non-competitive antagonist (NCA)-binding sites on muscle-type nAChRs. Both BAs non-competitively inhibited ACh activation of human fetal muscle nAChRs and sterically inhibited the specific binding of the NCAs [piperidyl-3,4-3H(N)]-(N-(1-(2-thienyl)cyclohexyl)-3,4-piperidine ([H-3]TCP) and [H-3]dizocilpine to Torpedo nAChRs in the desensitized state. These compounds modulated [H-3]tetracaine, [C-14]amobarbital and [H-3]TCP binding to resting nAChRs by allosteric mechanisms. Both BAs enhanced [H-3]TCP binding when the nAChR was initially in the resting but activatable state, suggesting that both compounds desensitized the Torpedo nAChR. Although DMXBA failed to activate human fetal muscle nAChRs, 4OH-DMXBA was found to be a partial agonist. [H-3]Nicotine competition-binding experiments confirmed that 4OH-DMXBA has higher affinity than DMXBA for the agonist sites, and that DMXBA is also a competitive antagonist. 3-(4-hydroxy-2-methoxybenzylidene)-anabaseine is a partial agonist for human fetal muscle nAChRs, whereas DMXBA only has competitive and NCA activities. The NCA-binding site for BAs overlaps both the phencyclidine- and dizocilpine-binding sites in the desensitized Torpedo nAChR ion channel. The desensitizing property of BAs suggests another possible mode of non-competitive inhibition in addition to direct channel-blocking mechanisms.	[Arias, H.

In this report, we describe the in vitro and in vivo anti-inflammatory properties of a potent histamine H-4 receptor antagonist, A-940894 (4-piperazin-1-yl-6,7-dihydro-5H-benzo[6,7]cyclohepta[1,2-d]pyrimidin-2-ylamine). We have analysed the pharmacological profile of A-940894 at mouse native, rat recombinant and human recombinant and native, histamine H-4 receptors by radioligand binding, calcium mobilization, mast cell shape change, eosinophil chemotaxis assays and in the mouse model of zymosan-induced peritonitis. A-940894 potently binds to both human and rat histamine H-4 receptors and exhibits considerably lower affinity for the human histamine H-1, H-2 or H-3 receptors. It potently blocked histamine-evoked calcium mobilization in the fluorometric imaging plate reader assays and inhibited histamine-induced shape change of mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells and chemotaxis of human eosinophils in vitro. In a mouse mast cell-dependent model of zymosan-induced peritonitis, A-940894 significantly blocked neutrophil influx and reduced intraperitoneal prostaglandin D-2 levels. Finally, A-940894 has good pharmacokinetic properties, including half-life and oral bioavailability in rats and mice. These data suggest that A-940894 is a potent and selective histamine H-4 receptor antagonist with pharmacokinetic properties suitable for long-term in vivo testing and could serve as a useful tool for the further characterization of histamine H-4 receptor pharmacology.

Characterization of a new class of potent inhibitors of the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7	BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article							OF-FUNCTION MUTATION; HIGH-AFFINITY PROBE; LOCAL-ANESTHETICS; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; SCN9A MUTATIONS; ALPHA-SUBUNIT; LIDOCAINE; NA(V)1.7; ERYTHROMELALGIA; ERYTHERMALGIA	Voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav1) transmit pain signals from peripheral nociceptive neurons, and blockers of these channels have been shown to ameliorate a number of pain conditions. Because these drugs can have adverse effects that limit their efficacy, more potent and selective Nav1 inhibitors are being pursued. Recent human genetic data have provided strong evidence for the involvement of the peripheral nerve sodium channel subtype, Nav1.7, in the signaling of nociceptive information, highlighting the importance of identifying selective Nav1.7 blockers for the treatment of chronic pain. Using a high-throughput functional assay, novel Nav1.7 blockers, namely, the 1-benzazepin-2-one series, have recently been identified. Further characterization of these agents indicates that, in addition to high-affinity inhibition of Nav1.7 channels, selectivity against the Nav1.5 and Nav1.8 subtypes can also be achieved within this structural class. The most potent, nonselective member of this class of Nav1.7 blockers has been radiolabeled with tritium. [H-3]BNZA binds with high affinity to rat brain synaptosomal membranes (K-d = 1.5 nM) and to membranes prepared from HEK293 cells stably transfected with hNav1.5 (Kd = 0.97 nM). In addition, and for the first time, high-affinity binding of a radioligand to hNav1.7 channels (K-d = 1.6 nM) was achieved with [H-3]BNZA, providing an additional means for identifying selective Nav1.7 channel inhibitors. Taken together, these data suggest that members of the novel 1-benzazepin-2-one structural class of Nav1 blockers can display selectivity toward the peripheral nerve Nav1.7 channel subtype, and with appropriate pharmacokinetic and drug metabolism properties, these compounds could be developed as analgesic agents.

Determining in vivo gamma-secretase expression and activity remains a challenge because its subunit proteins can exist in immature and preassembled forms, but may execute cellular roles irrelevant to gamma-site cleavage. in this study, we characterized [H-3]-L-685,458 as a radiotracer for the detection of active gamma-secretase in adult rat brain. In vitro autoradiography indicated that [H-3]-L-685,458 binding was saturatable, displaceable by peptidomimetic and small molecule gamma-secretase inhibitors, and exhibited rapid association and dissociation kinetics. In cultured hippocampal slices, [H-3]-L-685,458 binding density correlated with A beta reduction following in-dish dosing of this radioligand or a non-radioactive gamma-secretase inhibitor. [H-3]-L-68S,458 binding sites in the adult brain were differentially distributed across regions and laminas, with heavy binding localized to the olfactory glomeruli, hippocampal CA3 and cerebellar molecular layer, and moderate binding in the cerebral cortex, amygdala and selected subcortical regions. All of these regions showed labeling for presenilin-1 N-terminal fragments (PS1-NTFs). A distinct correlation of dense binding sites with abundant presence of PS1-NTFs was verified in hippocampal mossy fiber terminals and olfactory bulb glomeruli, suggestive of a rich expression of gamma-secretase in the synapses at these locations that are characteristic of dynamic plasticity. Together, [H-3]-L-685,458 is an excellent radiotracer for mapping active gamma-secretase complex, and may serve as a useful tool for studying the enzyme in vivo and in vitro.

To elucidate the role of particular components of the receptor complex in the ligand binding and second messenger activation level we have used Sf9 cell expression system. The expression of D-1 and A(1) receptors was confirmed by proper binding of specific radioligands [H-3]SCH23390 (K-d = 1.1 +/- 0.1 nM, B-max = 2.2 +/- 0.1 pmol/mg protein) and [H-3]DPCPX (K-d = 2.1 +/- 0.8 nM, B-max = 2.9 +/- 0.4 pmol/.mg protein), respectively. The kinetics of [3 H]SCH23390 binding corresponded to the simplest reversible bimolecular binding reaction of complex formation, with k(on) = 0.20 +/- 0.02 min(-1) nM(-1) and k(off) = 0. 13 +/- 0.01 min(-1). Dopaminergic agonists increased the accumulation of cAMP in the transfected cells in concentration-dependent manner, indicating a correct coupling of receptor to second messenger system. The coupling of the A(1) receptor to G(i) proteins was confirmed by both GTP gamma S dependent agonist binding and inhibition of cAMP accumulation by N-cyclopentyladenosine (NCPA). Activation of the A(1) receptor by NCPA had no significant influence on neither affinities of dopaminergic ligands nor the radioligand binding kinetics to the co-exprssed D-1 receptors in Sf9 cell membranes. On the other hand, the activation of the A(1) receptors inhibited the D-1 receptor-specific accumulation of cAMP, but only in cells where G(i) proteins were expressed with the receptors.

Distinct roles for protein kinase C Isoforms in regulating platelet purinergic receptor function	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							ADP RECEPTOR; TYROSINE PHOSPHORYLATION; CROSS-TALK; PKC-DELTA; DESENSITIZATION; ACTIVATION; INTERNALIZATION; P2Y(1); BETA; AGGREGATION	ADP is a critical regulator of platelet activation, mediating its actions through two G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), P2Y(1) and P2Y(12). We have shown previously that the receptors are functionally desensitized, in a homologous manner, by distinct kinase-dependent mechanisms in which P2Y(1) is regulated by protein kinase C (PKC) and P2Y(12) by G protein-coupled receptor kinases. In this study, we addressed whether different PKC isoforms play different roles in regulating the trafficking and activity of these two GPCRs. Expression of PKC alpha and PKC delta dominant-negative mutants in 1321N1 cells revealed that both isoforms regulated P2Y 1 receptor signaling and trafficking, although only PKC delta was capable of regulating P2Y(12), in experiments in which PKC was directly activated by the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). These results were paralleled in human platelets, in which PMA reduced subsequent ADP-induced P2Y(1) and P2Y(12) receptor signaling. PKC isoform-selective inhibitors revealed that novel, but not conventional, isoforms of PKC regulate P2Y(12) function, whereas both novel and classic isoforms regulate P2Y(1) activity. It is also noteworthy that we studied receptor internalization in platelets by a radioligand binding approach showing that both receptors internalize rapidly in these cells. ADP-induced P2Y(1) receptor internalization is attenuated by PKC inhibitors, whereas that of the P2Y(12) receptor is unaffected. Both P2Y(1) and P2Y(12) receptors can also undergo PMA-stimulated internalization, and here again, novel but not classic PKCs regulate P2Y(12), whereas both novel and classic isoforms regulate P2Y(1) internalization. This study therefore is the first to reveal distinct roles for PKC isoforms in the regulation of platelet P2Y receptor function and trafficking.

Thrombin, with a pEC(50) of 10.5, was 3000-fold more potent than the peptide agonists SFLLR and its derived compound C721-40 in stimulating luciferase activity, although the three agonists exhibited similar efficacy at the maximal concentration tested. Interestingly, SFLLR- and C721-40-induced luciferase activity was biphasic, suggesting that at least two populations of G proteins couple to the receptor. Further pharmacological characterization of this system was performed using selective protease activated receptor-1 antagonists. SCH203099 and ER-112787 blocked SFLLR-induced luciferase activity with similar potencies (pK(B) of 7), slightly higher than that exhibited by an arylisoxazole derivative compound from Merck (pK(B) of 6.1). These values correlated with their affinities established by competition binding experiments using [H-3]-C721-40 as radioligand for protease activated receptor-1. Transduction mechanisms of protease activated receptor-1 coupling to SRE-dependent luciferase activity were examined using specific inhibitors. The Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM, as well as the calmodulin inhibitors W-7 and ophiobolin A, robustly inhibited SFLLR-induced SRE activation. Overexpression of RGS2 and a dominant negative rhoA protein abolished the SFLLR signal in an additive manner, suggesting a major role of Gq and G12/13 proteins. Furthermore, inhibition of phospholipase C, MAP-kinases, phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase, rho-kinase and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, all downstream effectors of Gq and G12/13, partially blocked the SFLLR-induced luciferase signal. Taken together, this SRE-luciferase assay reveals a complex network of transduction pathways of protease activated receptor-1 in accordance with the pleiotrophic action of thrombin.

Human T-lymphoma Jurkat cells have been considered as lacking PBR and are often used as negative control to prove the specificity of PBR ligands effects. It is surprising that we evidenced PBR protein expression in this cell line by means of Western blotting and immunocytochemistry assays using specific anti-PBR antibodies. PBR intracellular localization was evidenced in mitochondria and nuclei, as demonstrated by confocal and electron microscopy. The binding of the [H-3]4'-chloro derivative of diazepam [H-3]7-chloro-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one (Ro5-4864) and the isoquinoline carboxamide derivative [H-3]1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3 isoquinolinecarboxamide (PK11195) evidenced a single class of binding sites with an unusual affinity constant (K-d) of 1.77 +/- 0.30 and 2.20 +/- 0.20 mu M, respectively. The pharmacological profile of the classic ligands showed that PK11195 was the most potent inhibitor in the radioligand binding assays followed by Ro5-4864 and diazepam, whereas clonazepam, a specific ligand for the central-type receptor, showed a K-i > 1.0 x 10(-4) M. By a combined strategy of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot experiments, we succeeded in isolating and cloning the full-length Jurkat PBR cDNA, called JuPBR. The JuPBR gene showed two single-nucleotide polymorphisms resulting in the two substitutions, Ala147 -> threonine and His162 -> arginine, of PBR amino acidic sequence. In conclusion, for the first time, we demonstrated PBR expression in Jurkat cells: the protein bound classic PBR ligands with micromolar affinity constants and presented a modified amino acidic sequence consequent to the detection of two gene polymorphisms.

After 72 h, the multiligand SS analog SOM230, which has a very high sst5 binding affinity, but not Octreotide (OCT), significantly inhibited basal ACTH release. To further explore the role of sst(5) in the regulation of ACTH release, we conducted additional studies with mouse AtT-20 cells. SOM230 showed a 7-fold higher ligand binding affinity and a 19-fold higher potency in stimulating guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) binding in AtT-20 cell membranes compared with OCT. SOM230 potently suppressed CRH-induced ACTH release, which was not affected by 48-h dexamethasone (DEX) pretreatment. However, DEX attenuated the inhibitory effects of OCT on ACTH release, whereas it increased the inhibitory potency of BIM-23268, an sst(5)-specific analog, on ACTH release. Quantitative PCR analysis showed that DEX lowered sst(2A+2B) mRNA expression significantly after 24 and 48 h, whereas sst(5) mRNA levels were not significantly affected by DEX treatment. Moreover, Scatchard analyses showed that DEX suppressed maximum binding capacity (B-max) by 72% when I-125-Tyr(3)-labeled OCT was used as radioligand, whereas B-max declined only by 17% when At T-20 cells were treated with [I-125-Tyr(11)]SS-14. These data suggest that the sst(5) protein, compared with sst(2), is more resistant to glucocorticoids. Finally, after SS analog preincubation, compared with OCT both SOM230 and BIM-23268 showed a significantly higher inhibitory effect on CRH-induced ACTH release. In conclusion, our data support the concept that the sst5 receptor might be a target for new therapeutic agents to treat Cushing's disease.

In a previous study using the neuroactive steroid analog, (3alpha,5beta)-6-azi-3-hydroxypregnan-20-one (6-AziP), as a photoaffinity-labeling reagent, we showed that voltage-dependent anion channel-1 (VDAC-1) was the predominant protein labeled in brain. Antisera to VDAC-1 were shown to coimmunoprecipitate GABA(A) receptors, suggesting a functional relationship between steroid binding to VDAC-1 and modulation of GABA(A) receptor function. This study examines the contribution of steroid binding to VDAC proteins to modulation of GABA(A) receptor function and anesthesia. Photolabeling of 35-kDa protein with [H-3] 6-AziP was reduced 85% in brain membranes prepared from VDAC-1-deficient mice but was unaffected by deficiency of VDAC-3. The photolabeled 35-kDa protein in membranes from VDAC-1-deficient mice was identified by two-dimensional electrophoresis and electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry as VDAC-2. The absence of VDAC-1 or VDAC-3 had no effect on the ability of neuroactive steroids to modulate GABA A receptor function as evidenced by radioligand ([S-35] t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate) binding or by electrophysiological studies. Electrophysiological studies also showed that neuroactive steroids modulate GABA(A) receptor function normally in VDAC-2-deficient fibroblasts transfected with alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2) GABA(A) receptor subunits. Finally, the neuroactive steroid pregnanolone [(3alpha,5beta)-3-hydroxypregnan-20-one] produced anesthesia (loss of righting reflex) in VDAC-1- and VDAC-3-deficient mice, and there was no difference in the recovery time between the VDAC-deficient mice and wild-type controls. These data indicate that neuroactive steroid binding to VDAC-1, -2, or -3 is unlikely to mediate GABA(A) receptor modulation or anesthesia.

J	Lucki, I; O'Leary, OF				Lucki, I; O'Leary, OF			Distinguishing roles for norepinephrine and serotonin in the behavioral effects of antidepressant drugs	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Symposium on Pharmacologic Treatments of Major Depression	FEB 10, 2003	New York, NY				FORCED SWIMMING TEST; RAT FRONTAL-CORTEX; DOPAMINE-BETA-HYDROXYLASE; IN-VIVO MICRODIALYSIS; DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS; REUPTAKE INHIBITOR; EXTRACELLULAR NORADRENALINE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; DEPRESSED-PATIENTS; RECEPTOR-BINDING	Antidepressant drugs have typically been classified into sets of compounds with actions targeted at serotonin (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]), norepinephrine (norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors [NRIs]), or both neurotransmitters (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors). Their classification has been based predominantly on their acute pharmacologic effects, usually determined by in vitro radioligand binding assays. The pharmacologic selectivity of antidepressants can be altered after their systemic administration, however, by dose, drug metabolism, physiologic interactions between neurotransmitters, and adaptive effects that emerge after chronic administration. This review examines whether pharmacologic selectivity is maintained by different types of antidepressants in vivo and whether pharmacologic selectivity matters for the production of their behavioral effects. Antidepressants increase extracellular levels of neurotransmitters according to their ability to inhibit presynaptic transporters, although physiologic interactions among neurotransmitters can influence antidepressants' selectivity in certain brain regions. Chronic administration of many antidepressants also causes down-regulation of postsynaptic and presynaptic receptors. The pattern of responses of presynaptic markers suggests that pharmacologic selectivity is maintained after chronic administration of many antidepressants. Behavioral tests indicate that depletion of serotonin (5-HT) is capable of preventing the effects produced by SSRIs but not NRIs. The depletion of catecholamines also inhibits the effects of NRIs, although test results can be complicated by inhibition of motor activity. Depletion of norepinephrine may also inhibit the effects of some SSRIs, but not highly selective SSRIs like citalopram. Although the pattern of results from in vivo tests supports the concept that parallel neurotransmitter mechanisms lead to antidepressant activity, norepinephrine may participate in the effects of some SSRIs. It is also possible that compounds with dual actions at 5-HT and norepinephrine systems may be effective under circumstances in which selective antidepressants are ineffective.

Considering the possible relevant role played by the lipid phase in the peptide-receptor interaction, the structures of two cyclic a-MSH analogues, containing both Trp and D-Nal fluorophores, were investigated by steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, in aqueous solution and in the presence of dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol (DMPG) vesicles, and compared with that of the natural peptide. The amino acid D-Nal gives a unique de-excitation fluorescence profile, with an excited state lifetime much longer than those of Trp, allowing good distinction between the two fluorophores. The cyclic analogues' aqueous structures seem to be adequate for membrane penetration, as Trp fluorescence indicates that, in both aqueous and lipid media, the Trp environment in the cyclic peptides is similar to that of a-MSH when incorporated in lipid bilayers. Trp, in the cyclic analogues, seems to penetrate deeper in the bilayer than in the native peptide. The amino acid D-Nal was also found to penetrate deep into the lipid bilayer, having its excited-state lifetime drastically changed from aqueous solution to lipid medium. The present work shows that D-Nal may serve as a fluorescent probe for studies of MC peptides and suggests that the high affinity and selectivity of the cyclic peptides to the MC4 membrane receptor could be related to their deeper penetration into the bilayer core.

The specific binding of 2-[I-125]iodomelatonin was rapid, stable, saturable, and reversible. Saturation experiments demonstrated that 2-[I-125]iodomelatonin binds to a single class of receptor sites with an affinity constant (K-d) of 6.3 +/- 0.5 pM and a total binding capacity (B(ma)x) Of 15.18 +/- 0.22 fmol/mg protein in underyearling precocious males in July. Competition experiments revealed that the binding sites are highly specific for melatonin and related analogues. Treatment with guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) significantly reduced the specific binding, indicating that melatonin binding sites in the masu salmon brain are coupled to G protein. Significant differences were seen in B-max, but not K-d, among the fish groups differing in maturity. In the underyearling fish in July, the B-max of precocious males and immature males was significantly higher than that of immature females. Then, the Borax of precocious males decreased in October, when the fish spermiated. In the 2-year-old fish, B-max was significantly higher in spermiating males than ovulated females. These results indicate that melatonin plays neuromodulatory roles in the central nervous system through specific receptors. Furthermore, gonadal maturation affects the density of melatonin binding sites in the masu salmon brain by an unknown mechanism. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

In the present study, we show that kinin-mediated mitogenic signalling and prostate-cell growth involves two subtypes of bradykinin (BK) receptors, B1R and B2R. Specific stimulation of either B1R or B2R by their respective agonists des-Arg(9)-BK and Lys-BK promoted ERK activation and cell growth, whereas selective blockade with specific antagonists des-Arg(9)-[Leu(8)]BK and Hoe 140 respectively obliterated this effect, indicating the presence of both receptor subtypes. However, blockade of B1R also inhibited B2R-mediated ERK activation and cell growth, and, similarly, antagonism of B2R inhibited the B1R-mediated response. Furthermore, both B1R and B2R agonists promoted internalization of B1R, whereas both receptor antagonists blocked this effect. The B1R ligands des-Arg(9)-BK and des-Arg(9)- [Leu(8)]BK had no effect on the binding of BK to B2R, as demonstrated by radioligand competitive binding studies. However, blockade of either B1R or B2R impaired the ability of the reciprocal receptor to produce inositol phosphates, suggesting that the interaction between B1R and B2R is proximal to activation of phospholipase C. These results provide evidence for the existence of B1R-B2R complexes in prostate cancer PC3 cells and demonstrate that antagonism of one receptor interferes with the signalling ability of the other, possibly at the level of receptor-Galpha(q) protein coupling. Selective inhibition of B1R, which is up-regulated in injured and cancerous tissue, may be beneficial for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.

The title compounds were obtained from 1-aryl-2-iminoimidazolidines (1) by cyclization reaction with oxalic acid derivatives-ethyl ester (2) or chloride (3). They were tested for pharmacological activity in animal and binding assay tests. With moderate acute toxic ity (LD50 similar to 200 mg kg(-1), i.p.), they exhibited significant analgesic and serotonergic activities as results of the 'writhing' and the 'hot plate' tests indicated, and reduced number of 'head twitch' episodes after 5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan) administration. Reversion of the antinociception produced in the 'writhing' test by small dose of naloxon (5 mg kg(-1)) can suggest an opioid-like mechanism of their analgesic activity. The probable receptor inhibition mechanism of their analgesic and serotonergic activity was confirmed in the binding assay tests (by radioligand displacement) toward the opioid mu and scrotonin 5-HT2 receptors. Additionally, they exhibited affinity toward the benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor as well, although in behavioral tests compounds did not produce any clear depressive effect on the central nervous system (CNS) of mice. Simple chemical structure of the title compounds, in comparison to other carbonyl derivatives of 1-aryl-2-iminoimidazolidine presented in this series of papers, underline very important role both of a hydrophobic moiety (aromatic ring) and polar groups (hydrogen-bond acceptors) in the serotonin receptor interaction. The coexistence of opioid-like, serotonergic and BZD receptor inhibition activity can be very interesting and can lead to creation of the novel group of antidepressants.

Carvedilol and bucindolol are beta-blockers with additional alpha(1)-adrenoceptor blocking activities. We studied the effects of carvedilol and bucindolol on noradrenaline-induced protein synthesis (assessed by [H-3] phenylalanine incorporation) in adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes. Radioligand binding studies with [I-125] iodocyanopindolol and [H-3] prazosin revealed that carvedilol had a much higher affinity to alpha(1)-adrenoceptors than bucindolol (beta(1)/alpha(1)-adrenoceptor ratio for carvedilol, 1:2.7; for bucindolol, 1: 43). Noradrenaline-evoked increases in protein synthesis were enhanced by propranolol (1 muM) and beta(1)-adrenoceptor-selective antagonists bisoprolol (1 muM) and CGP 20712A [1-[2-((3-carbamoyl-4-hydroxy) phenoxy)-ethyl-amino]-3-[4-(1-methyl-4-trifluoromethyl-2- imidazolyl) phenoxy]-2-propranol methanesulfonate] (300 nM). Carvedilol (100 pM-10 muM) inhibited 1 muM noradrenaline-induced increase in protein synthesis with monophasic concentration-inhibition curves independent of whether CGP 20712A was present or not; K-i values for carvedilol were 5 to 6 nM. In contrast, bucindolol (100 pM-10 muM) inhibited 1 muM noradrenaline-induced increase in protein synthesis with a bell-shaped concentration-inhibition curve; it increased noradrenaline-induced protein synthesis at 10 nM, although at concentrations >100 nM it was inhibited. In the presence of 300 nM CGP 20712A or 1 muM propranolol, however, bucindolol inhibited 1 muM noradrenaline-induced increase in protein synthesis with monophasic concentration-inhibition curves; K-i values were 40 to 75 nM. On the other hand, both carvedilol and bucindolol inhibited 1 muM phenylephrine-induced protein synthesis with monophasic concentration-inhibition curves; K-i values were 4 (carvedilol) and 45 nM (bucindolol). These results indicate that, at low (beta-adrenoceptor blocking) concentrations, bucindolol can enhance noradrenaline-induced protein synthesis whereas it is inhibited by carvedilol.

Although chemokines often form multimers in solution, this process may be enhanced following interaction with GAGS on the cell surface, or within the extracellular matrix. However, the significance of multimerization for chemokine function remains controversial. In the present study, a fusion protein was prepared between the prototypical human CC chemokine, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1; also known as CCL-2) and a large secreted placental alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) moiety. This fusion protein (MCP-1-SEAP) remained monomeric under conditions that promote oligomerization of the native chemokine. Radioligand binding showed that both native MCP-1 and MCP-1-SEAP competed for the same site on the surface of HEK-293 cells expressing the CCR2b chemokine receptor. The interaction between either chemokine species and endothelial cell surface GAGS was antagonized by the addition of the heparan sulphate-like molecule, heparin. Both MCP-1 and MCP-1-SEAP induced a Ca2+-flux in the THP-1 monocytic cell line, and were equally effective at promoting transendothelial chemotaxis of mononuclear immune cells, with maximal migration being produced by treatment with 12 nM of either species. In each case this chemotactic response was almost completely antagonized by the addition of heparin. The importance of interaction between either native MCP-1 or MCP-1-SEAP and cell-surface GAGS for transcellular migration was demonstrated by the almost complete absence of leucocyte chemotaxis across monolayers of GAG-deficient mutant cells. In summary, this study shows that multimerization is neither necessary for, nor potentiates, the biological activity of MCP-1. However, the results do clearly demonstrate the importance of the interaction between MCP-1 and cell-surface heparan sulphate for transmonolayer leucocyte chemotaxis.

Whether refractory PD in IDDM patients is related to autoimmunity as indicated by serum glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibody GAD Ab levels or to host bacterial immunity as reflected by serum antibody titers to periodontal pathogens is unknown. Aims: To determine if non-surgical periodontal treatment outcome differs between GAD Ab-seropositive and -seronegative IDDM patients by assessing the following parameters: (1) pretreatment serum levels of GAD Ab, (2) pretreatment serum Ige titers to key periodontal pathogens, and (3) changes in periodontal pocket probing depth (PDC) after treatment. Methods: Before and two months after periodontal treatment of Il GAD Abseronegative and 7 -seropositive subjects, PDC was assessed and serum GAD Ab and IgG to Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Bacteroides forsythus (Bf), and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) were studied using established radioligand precipitation and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, respectively. Results: The PDC decrease was significantly better for GAD Ab-seronegative subjects than for seropositive subjects (median 1.4 mm +/-0.5 s.d versus 0.5 mm +/-0.3 s.d., p <0.03, Mann-Whitney). GAD Ab levels and PDC were positively correlated (r=+0.71, p <0.05) for sere-positive subjects but were neutral (r=-0.07) for seronegative subjects. Serum IgG to Pg and GAD Ab levels were positively associated (r(2)=0.42) in seropositive subjects. Logistic regression analysis confirmed that GAD Ab status was the primary discriminator for PDC (p <0.04). Conclusion: Detection of elevated GAD Ab levels in combination with elevated Ige titers to Pg before treatment is indicative of IDDM patients with refractory PD.

ED50 values (mg/kg) were obtained for the channel blockers (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5,4-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate ((+)-MK-801, 0.2), 1-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)piperidine (phencyclidine, PCP, 1.7) and ketamine (4.4). Antagonists at the glutamate (DL-(2-carboxypiperazine-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonate (DL-CPP, 5.7)) and glycine site (7-Chloro-4-hydroxy-3-(3-phenoxy)-phenyl-2(H)quinolinone (L-701,324, 14.1), 3R( +)cis-4-methyl-pyrrollid-2-one (L-687,414, 15.1)) inhibited [H-3]MK-801 binding in vivo to varying maximum levels (69%, 103% and 45%, respectively). NR2B subunit-selective compounds acting at the ifenprodil site inhibited [H-3]MK-801 in vivo by a maximum of 52-72% and gave ED50 values (mg/kg) of: (+/-)-(1S*,2S*)-1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-(4-hydroxy-4-phenylpiperidino)- 1-propanol ((+/-)CP- 101,606), 1.9; ( +/-)-(3R,4S)-3-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-hydroxypiperidin-1-yl]chroman-4,7-diol ((+/-)CP-283,097), 1.8; (+/-)-(R*,S*)-alpha-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-beta-methyl-4-(phenylmethyl)-1-piperidine propanol ((+/-)Ro 25-6981), 1.0; ifenprodil, 6.0. The glycine site agonist D-serine stimulated binding to 151% of control with an ED50 of 1.7 mg/kg. Results show that [H-3]MK-801 binding in vivo may be used to measure receptor occupancy of ligands acting not only within the ion channel but also at modulatory sites on the NMDA receptor complex.

The parametric images describing the tracer kinetics were generated by either compartmental or graphical analysis, and were examined statistically on region-of-interest and voxel-by-voxel bases. The binding potential of H-1 receptors showed a significant decrease particularly in the frontal and temporal areas of the Alzheimer's disease brain compared to the old, normal subjects. In addition, the receptor binding correlated closely to the severity of Alzheimer's disease assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination score within several brain areas. The ratio of K1 values between the brain areas and the cerebellum was used as a relative measure of regional cerebral blood flow which decreased in the frontal and temporal areas of the Alzheimer's disease brain. However, the difference in the binding potential (total concentration of receptor/equilibrium dissociation constant) between the Alzheimer's disease patients and the old, normal subjects was greater than that in the cerebral blood flow, and the rate of decrease in the binding potential with the progression of Alzheimer's disease was greater than the rate of decrease in the cerebral blood flow. This study reveals the predominant disruption of the histaminergic neurotransmission in the neurodegenerative processes of Alzheimer's disease, This study suggests that the decline of the histamine receptor binding might play a substantial role in the cognitive deficits of Alzheimer's disease patients.

Although the tiger salamander is a major model system for thp,study of retinal circuitry and regeneration, our understanding of GABA receptors in this species is almost exclusively based on the results of physiological studies. Therefore, we have examined the pharmacological binding properties of GABA(A) receptors and their anatomical localization in the tiger salamander retina. Radioligand-binding studies showed that specific H-3-GABA binding to GABA(A) receptors was dominated by a single high-affinity binding site (K-d = 15.6 +/- 6.9 nM). Specific binding of H-3-GABA was almost completely eliminated by muscimol (K-i = 105 +/- 62 nM) and bicuculline (K-i = 14.3 +/- 2.2 mu M); however, SR-95531 only displaced about 40% of specific H-3-GABA binding (K-i = 35.0 +/- 3.8 nM). These data indicate that there are at least two subtypes of GABA(A) receptors present in the salamander retina that can be distinguished by their antagonist binding properties: one sensitive to both bicuculline and SR-95531, and one sensitive to bicuculline but insensitive to SR-95531. Because localization of GABA receptors in the salamander retina by immunocytochemistry is problematic, GABA(A) receptors were localized by fluorescent ligand binding combined with immunocytochemical labeling for cell specific markers. Binding of fluorescently labeled muscimol to GABA(A) receptors was present in both plexiform layers and on photoreceptor cell bodies. GABA(A) receptors in the outer plexiform layer were localized to both photoreceptor terminals and horizontal cell processes.

Evaluation of Tetrazine Tracers for Pretargeted Imaging within the Central Nervous System	BIOCONJUGATE CHEMISTRY			English	Article							TRANS-CYCLOOCTENE; IMPROVED STABILITY; CLICK CHEMISTRY; IMMUNO-PET; ANTIBODY; REACTIVITY; LIGATION; REAGENTS; RECEPTOR; IGG	The pretargeting approach separates the biological half-life of an antibody from the physical half-life of the radioisotope label, providing a strategy for reducing the radiation burden. A widely explored pretargeting approach makes use of the bioorthogonal click reaction between tetrazines (Tzs) and trans-cyclooctenes (TCOs), combining the targeting specificity of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with the rapid clearance and precise reaction of Tzs and TCOs. Such a strategy can allow for the targeting and imaging (e.g., by positron emission tomography (PET)) of molecular markers, which cannot be addressed by solely relying on small molecules. Tz derivatives that undergo inverse electron-demand Diels-Alder (IEDDA) reactions with an antibody bearing TCO moieties have been investigated. This study describes the synthesis and characterization of 11 cold Tz imaging agent candidates. These molecules have the potential to be radiolabeled with F-18 or H-3, and with the former label, they could be of use as imaging tracers for positron emission tomography studies. Selection was made using a multiparameter optimization score for the central nervous system (CNS) PET tracers. Novel tetrazines were tested for their pH-dependent chemical stability. Those which turned out to be stable in a pH range of 6.5-8 were further characterized in in vitro assays with regard to their passive permeability, microsomal stability, and P-glycoprotein transport. Furthermore, selected Tzs were examined for their systemic clearance and CNS penetration in a single-dose pharmacokinetic study in rats. Two tetrazines were successfully labeled with F-18, one of which showed brain penetration in a biodistribution study in mice. Another Tz was successfully tritium-labeled and used to demonstrate a bioorthogonal click reaction on a TCO-modified antibody. As a result, we identified one Tz as a potential fluorine-18-labeled CNS-PET agent and a second as a 3H-radioligand for an IEDDA-based reaction with a modified brain-penetrating antibody.

Safety of [<SUP>177</SUP>Lu]Lu-NeoB treatment: a preclinical study characterizing absorbed dose and acute, early, and late organ toxicity	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						GRPR; [Lu-177]Lu-NeoB; Radiotoxicity; Dosimetry; Radionuclide therapy	PEPTIDE RECEPTOR; RADIONUCLIDE THERAPY; PROSTATE-CANCER; ANTAGONIST; PRRT	Purpose The radiolabeled gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR)-targeting antagonist NeoB is a promising radioligand for imaging and therapy of GRPR-expressing malignancies. In the current study, we aimed to discover the target organs of toxicity and the radiotoxic effects to these organs, when repeated dosages of [Lu-177]Lu-NeoB are administered to healthy female and male mice. Methods Animals received either 3 injections, with a 7-day interval, of vehicle (control group 1), 1200 pmol [Lu-175]Lu-NeoB (control group 2) or 40 MBq/400 pmol, 80 MBq/800 pmol, and 120 MBq/1200 pmol [Lu-177]Lu-NeoB (treatment groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively). At week 5, 19, and 43 after the first injection acute, early, and late organ toxicity, respectively, was determined. For this, histopathological and blood analyses were performed. To correlate the observed toxicity to absorbed dose, we also performed extensive biodistribution and dosimetry studies. Results The biodistribution study showed the highest absorbed doses in GRPR-expressing pancreas, the liver, and the kidneys (the main organs of excretion). Both control groups and almost all animals of treatment group 1 did not show any treatment-related toxicological effects. Despite the high absorbed doses, no clear microscopic signs of toxicity were found in the pancreas and the liver. Histological analysis indicated kidney damage in the form of hydronephrosis and nephropathy in treatment groups 2 and 3 that were sacrificed at the early and late time point. In the same groups, increased blood urea nitrogen levels were found. Conclusion In general, repeated administration of [Lu-177]Lu-NeoB was tolerated. The most significant radiotoxic effects were found in the kidneys, similar to other clinically applied radioligands. The results of this study underline the potential of [Lu-177]Lu-NeoB as a promising option for clinical therapy.	[Ruigrok, Eline A.

We synthesized, labeled, and assessed a series of radiotracers based on a previous high contrast PET imaging radiopharmaceutical [Ga-68]Ga-BL02, with modifications to its linker and metal chelator, in order to improve its tumor-to-kidney contrast ratio. Methods: Based on the design of BL02, a piperidine-based cationic linker (BL06) and several anionic linkers (tri-Aad (BL17); tri-D-Glu (BL20); tri-Asp (BL25); and tri-cysteic acid (BL31)) were substituted for the triglutamate linker. Additionally, the DOTA chelator was swapped for a DOTAGA chelator (BL30). Each radiotracer was labeled with Ga-68 and evaluated in CXCR4-expressing Daudi xenograft mice with biodistribution and/or PET imaging studies. Results: Of all the evaluated radiotracers, [Ga-68]Ga-BL31 showed the most promising biodistribution profile, with a lower kidney uptake compared to [Ga-68]Ga-BL02, while retaining the high imaging contrast capabilities of [Ga-68]Ga-BL02. [Ga-68]Ga-BL31 also compared favorably to [Ga-68]Ga-Pentixafor, with superior imaging contrast in all non-target organs. The other anionic linker-based radiotracers showed either equivocal or worse contrast ratios compared to [Ga-68]Ga-BL02; however, [Ga-68]Ga-BL25 also showed lower kidney uptake, as compared to that of [Ga-68]Ga-BL02. Meanwhile, [Ga-68]Ga-BL06 had high non-target organ uptake and relatively lower tumor uptake, while [Ga-68]Ga-BL30 showed significantly increased kidney uptake and similar tumor uptake values. Conclusions: [Ga-68]Ga-BL31 is an optimized CXCR4-targeting radiopharmaceutical with lower kidney retention that has clinical potential for PET imaging and radioligand therapy.

Preclinical Evaluation of <SUP>213</SUP>Bi- and <SUP>225</SUP>Ac-Labeled Low-Molecular-Weight Compounds for Radiopharmaceutical Therapy of Prostate Cancer	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA); alpha-particle; prostate carcinoma; long-termtoxicity; murine	TARGETED ALPHA-THERAPY; MEMBRANE ANTIGEN; RADIOLIGAND THERAPY; DOSIMETRY; PSMA; EXPRESSION; EFFICACY; ANTIBODY; MODEL; MICE	Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted radiopharmaceutical therapy is a new option for patients with advanced prostate cancer refractory to other treatments. Previously, we synthesized a beta-particle-emitting low-molecular-weight compound, Lu-177-L1 which demonstrated reduced off-target effects in a xenograftmodel of prostate cancer. Here, we leveraged that scaffold to synthesize alpha-particle-emitting analogs of L1, Bi-213-L1 and Ac-225-L1, to evaluate their safety and cell kill effect in PSMA-positive (1) xenograftmodels. Methods: The radiochemical synthesis, cell uptake, cell kill, and biodistribution of Bi-213-L1 and Ac-225-L1 were evaluated. The efficacy of Ac-225-L1 was determined in human PSMA+ subcutaneous and micrometastatic models. Subacute toxicity at 8 wk and chronic toxicity at 1 y after administration were evaluated for Ac-225-L1. The absorbed radiation dose of Ac-225-L1 was determined using the biodistribution data and a-camera imaging. Results: Bi-213-and Ac-225-L1 demonstrated specific cell uptake and cell kill in PSMA + cells. The biodistribution of Bi-213-L1 and Ac-225-L1 revealed specific uptake of radioactivity within PSMA+ lesions. Treatment studies of Ac-225-L1 demonstrated activity-dependent, specific inhibition of tumor growth in the PSMA+ flank tumor model. Ac-225-L1 also showed an increased survival benefit in the micrometastatic model compared with 177Lu-L1. Activity-escalated acute and chronic toxicity studies of Ac-225-L1 revealed off-target radiotoxicity, mainly in kidneys and liver. The estimated maximumtolerated activitywas about 1MBq/kg. alpha-Camera imaging of Ac-225-L1 revealed high renal cortical accumulation at 2 h followed by fast clearance at 24 h. Conclusion: Ac-225-L1 demonstrated activity-dependent efficacy with minimal treatment-related organ radiotoxicity. Ac-225-L1 is a promising therapeutic for further clinical evaluation.

Moreover, the use of stereotactic body radiotherapy as a metastasis directed therapy in patients with oligometastatic PCa has significantly increased in the recent years. Conventional imaging techniques, including transrectal ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), morphologic magnetic resonance and bone scintigraphy have traditionally played a minor role in all those clinical scenarios due to its low diagnostic accuracy. The recent development of the positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer Ga-68-PSMA binding to the prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), a transmembrane glycoprotein overexpressed in PCa cells, has shown promising results. Detection rates for PCa lesions are higher than CT and higher than the best technique available, the PET/CT with choline. Its superiority has been demonstrated even at very low PSA levels (<1 ng/ml). This increase in diagnostic accuracy represents a potential impact on patient management, especially in radiotherapy. Even if this imaging technique is already available for routine clinical practice in some European countries, in Spain, unfortunately, there is very limited access. In this review, we analyze the main studies that investigate the usefulness of Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT in patients with PCa and its potential impact on radiotherapy treatments. In addition, we compared the Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT, with the multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and the PET/CT with choline, in the different clinical scenarios.

The antinociceptive properties were estimated in three models of pain in mice-the hot plate test, the formalin test, and in the oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy. Moreover, extended anticonvulsant studies were carried out and the antiseizure activity was investigated in the 6-Hz test. Considering drug safety evaluation, the influence of compounds on locomotor activity and contextual memory were checked. Furthermore, chosen molecules were tested in vitro for potential hepatotoxicity. To explain the probable mechanism of action, the radioligand binding assays were performed. In both phases of formalin test, analgesic activity demonstrated compounds 4, 8, and 9. These agents relieved also mechanical allodynia in oxaliplatin-induced model of neuropathic pain. At active doses, they did not influence locomotor activity of mice. Moreover, for compounds 8 and 9, no deleterious effect on memory was observed, but compound 4 might induce memory deficits. All tested compounds (4, 5, 8, 9, 15, and 16) inhibited psychomotor seizures with the ED50 values = 24.66-47.21 mg/kg. The binding studies showed that compound 4 only at the high concentrations revealed the effective binding to the neuronal sodium channels and moderately binding to the L-type calcium (verapamil site) channels and NMDA receptors. The present preclinical results proved that novel hybrid molecules demonstrate very promising anticonvulsant and analgesic activity.

Participants were 84 healthy, 18- to 30-year-old, social drinkers recruited via fliers and newspaper advertisements. At assessment, participants completed measures of lifetime personal and family substance use and psychiatric symptoms. Participants underwent two consecutive positron emission tomography scans using the D-2/D-3 dopamine receptor radioligand [C-11]raclopride. Scans were preceded by intravenous saline and amphetamine 0.3 mg/kg, providing measures of baseline [C-11]raclopride binding potential (BPND) and change in [C-11]raclopride (Delta BPND). Subjective ratings of stimulant drug effects were collected during scans. Subjects were classified as family history positive (FHP) if they reported any first-degree relative with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and family history negative (FHN) if no first-degree relatives had history of AUD. Participants were predominantly White (69.0 percent) and male (62.1 percent). Baseline [C-11]raclopride BPND was generally higher in FHP compared with FHN subjects across striatal subdivisions. There were no differences in Delta BPND across regions. Negative subjective drug effects were more pronounced in FHP than in FHN subjects. While FHN subjects evidenced the expected positive relationship between Delta BPND and positive subjective drug effects, this relationship was disrupted in FHP subjects. There are key differences in dopamine status and subjective stimulant drug experiences as a function of family AUD history. These findings have important implications for understanding risk for AUD development in FHP offspring.	[Alvanzo, Anika A.

A D-3-preferring D2/3R agonist tracer, [C-11](+) PHNO, has demonstrated that body mass index (BMI) was positively associated with D2/3R availability within striatal reward regions. To date, OB individuals have not been studied with [C-11](+) PHNO. We assessed D2/3R availability in striatal and extrastriatal reward regions in 14 OB and 14 age-and gender-matched NW individuals with [C-11](+) PHNO PET utilizing a high-resolution research tomograph. Additionally, in regions where group D2/3R differences were observed, secondary analyses of 42 individuals that constituted an overweight cohort was done to study the linear association between BMI and D2/3R availability in those respective regions. A group-by-brain region interaction effect (F-7.82 = 2.08, p=0.047) was observed. Post hoc analyses revealed that OB individuals exhibited higher tracer binding in D-3-rich regions: the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA) (+ 20%; p = 0.02), ventral striatum (VST) (+ 14%; p<0.01), and pallidum (+ 11%; p=0.02). BMI was also positively associated with D2/3R availability in the SN/VTA (r=0.34, p=0.03), VST (r=0.36, p = 0.02), and pallidum (r=0.30, p=0.05) across all subjects. These data suggest that individuals who are obese have higher D2/3R availability in brain reward regions densely populated with D(3)Rs, potentially identifying a novel pharmacologic target for the treatment of obesity.

We measured striatal PDE10A occupancy by TAK-063, a newly developed compound with high affinity and selectivity for PDE10A, using PET with [C-11]T-773 in nonhuman primates. Two 123-min dynamic PET measurements were performed on three female rhesus monkeys, once at baseline and again after intravenous administration of different doses of TAK-063 (0.2-1.6 mg/kg). Total distribution volume (V-T) was calculated with a two-tissue compartment model using metabolite-corrected plasma input. Although the in vitro autoradiography did not show high specific binding to [C-11]T-773 in the cerebellum, V-T in the cerebellum decreased after TAK-063 treatment. The specific binding to PDE10A (V-S) was calculated as the difference of the V-T between the target regions and the cerebellum. PDE10A occupancy was calculated as the percent change of V-S. The average PDE10A occupancy of the caudate nucleus and putamen was 35.2% at 0.2 mg/kg and 83.2% at 1.6 mg/kg. In conclusion, this nonhuman primate PET study demonstrated that [C-11]T-773 is useful to estimate the PDE10A occupancy by TAK-063 in the striatum although there is in vivo interaction of the uptake between [C-11]T-773 and TAK-063 in the cerebellum. These results warrant further clinical occupancy study for TAK-063. Synapse 70:253-263, 2016. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Influence of <i>HLA</i>-<i>DR</i> and -<i>DQ</i> alleles on autoantibody recognition of distinct epitopes within the juxtamembrane domain of the IA-2 autoantigen in type 1 diabetes	DIABETOLOGIA			English	Article						Autoantibodies; Epitopes; HLA-DQ; HLA-DR; IA-2	ISLET ANTIGEN-2; ASSOCIATION; AUTOIMMUNITY; ANTIBODIES; MOLECULE; BETA	Aims/hypothesis Insulinoma-associated protein 2 (IA-2) is a major target of autoimmunity in type 1 diabetes. When first detected, IA-2-autoantibodies commonly bind epitopes in the juxtamembrane (JM) domain of IA-2 and antibody responses subsequently spread to the tyrosine phosphatase domain. Definition of structures of epitopes in the JM domain, and genetic requirements for autoimmunity to these epitopes, is important for our understanding of initiation and progression of autoimmunity. The aims of this study were to investigate the contribution of individual amino acids in the IA-2 JM domain to antibody binding to these epitopes and the role of HLA genotypes in determining epitope specificity. Methods Regions of the JM domain recognised by autoantibodies were identified by peptide competition and inhibitory effects of alanine substitutions of residues within the JM region. Antibody binding was determined by radioligand binding assays using sera from patients genotyped for HLA-DRB1 and -DQB1 alleles. Results Patients were categorised into two distinct groups of JM antibody reactivity according to peptide inhibition. Inhibition by substitutions of individual amino acids within the JM domain differed between patients, indicating heterogeneity in epitope recognition. Cluster analysis defined six groups of residues having similar inhibitory effects on antibody binding, with three clusters showing differences in patients affected or unaffected by peptide. One cluster demonstrated significant differences in antibody binding between HLA-DRB1*04 and HLA-DRB1*07 patients and within DRB1*04 individuals; antibody recognition of a second cluster depended on expression of HLA-DQB1*0302. Conclusions/interpretation The results identify amino acids contributing to distinct epitopes on IA-2, with both HLA-DR and HLA-DQ alleles influencing epitope specificity.

However, previous investigations of the serotonin transporter (SERT) focused on regional differences with varying results depending on the clinical syndrome. Here, we aimed to describe the serotonergic system of MDD patients on a network level by evaluating SERT associations across brain regions. Twenty medication free patients with major depression and 20 healthy controls underwent positron emission tomography using the radioligand [C-11]DASB. SERT binding potentials (BPND) were quantified voxel-wise with the multilinear reference tissue model 2. In addition, SERT BPND was extracted from the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) as an indicator of midbrain serotonergic neurotransmission. Whole-brain linear regression analysis was applied to evaluate the association of DRN SERT bindings to those in projection areas, which was followed by ANCOVA to assess differences in interregional relationships between patients and controls. Although both groups showed widespread positive correlations, group differences were restricted to decreased SERT associations between the DRN and the ventral striatum (right and left respectively: t=5.85, P<0.05 corrected and t=5.07, P<0.1 corrected) when comparing MDD patients (R-2=0.11 and 0.24) to healthy subjects (R-2=0.72 and 0.66, P < 0.01 and 0.05 corrected). Adjusting for age and sex did not change these findings. This study indicates a disturbed regulation between key regions involved in reward processing via the SERT. Our interregional approach highlights the importance of evaluating pathophysiological alterations on a network level to gain complementary information in addition to regional investigations.

The synthetic strategy for the preparation of these N,N-diethyl-2-(2-(4-(omega-fluoroalk-1-ynyl) phenyl)-5,7-dimethylpyrazolo[1,5-a] pyrimidin-3-yl) acetamides (7a-d) consisted in derivatizing a key iodinated building block featuring the pyrazolopyrimidine acetamide backbone of DPA-714, by Sonogashira couplings with various alkynyl reagents. The resulting alkynols were subsequently fluorinated, yielding the expected target derivatives. All four analogues exhibited slightly higher affinity and selectivity towards the TSPO 18 kDa (K-i vs [H-3]PK11195: 0.35-0.79 nM; Ki vs [H-3] flunitrazepam: > 1000 nM) when compared to DPA-714 (Ki vs [H-3] PK11195: 0.91 nM; Ki vs [H-3] flunitrazepam: > 1000 nM). Lipophilicities (HPLC, logD(7.4)) increased with the chain length (from 3.6 to 4.3) and were significantly higher than the one determined for DPA-714 (2.9). Preliminary in vitro metabolism evaluation using rat microsomal incubations and LC-MS analyses showed, for all four novel analogues, the absence of defluorinated metabolites. Among them, the fluoropentynyl compound, DPA-C5yne (7c), was selected, labelled in one single step with fluorine-18 from the corresponding tosylate and in vivo evaluated with PET on our in-house-developed rat model of acute local neuroinflammation.

In addition to its role in the regulation of granulopoiesis, treatment with G-CSF is considered the standard approach to mobilize CD34 positive (CD34(+)) mononuclear cells for reconstituting hemopoietic ability for bone marrow transplantation. An intended biosimilar filgrastim (coded BK0023) was produced in GMP conditions by E. coli fermentation according to an original recombinant process and showed physico-chemical properties and purity profile similar to Neupogen (R), a commercial preparation of filgrastim. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate the comparability of BK0023 to Neupogen (R) in terms of both in vitro biological activities and in vivo toxicology, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Methods: Cell proliferation and radioligand binding assays were conducted in NFS-60 cells to compare the biological activity and functional interaction with the G-CSF receptor in vitro, while preclinical in vivo studies, including pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics after repeated dose were performed in normal and neutropenic rats. A phase I study was carried out in healthy male volunteers treated by multiple-dose subcutaneous administration of BK0023 and Neupogen (R) to evaluate their pharmacodynamic effects as well as their pharmacokinetic and safety profile and to demonstrate their pharmacodynamic equivalence and pharmacokinetic bioequivalence. Results: The results reported in this work demonstrate that BK0023 is comparable in terms of biological activity, efficacy and safety to Neupogen (R). Conclusions: BK0023 has the same pharmacokinetic profile, efficacy and safety as the reference commercial filgrastim Neupogen (R) and therefore could be further developed to become a convenient option to treat neutropenia in oncological patients.

Objective: To evaluate the correlation between dopamine transporter (DAT) regulated by L-DOPA and the pathogenesis of dyskinesia in PD rats. Methods: Thirty rats were used to establish the PD model by injecting 6-hydroxydopamine into the right medial forebrain bundle. The sham surgery rats (n = 4) received 4 mu l of physiological saline. Then, 19 rats in which PD has been successfully induced were randomly assigned to the L-DOPA (20 mg/kg/day; n = 15) or model (saline; n = 4) group. After 4 weeks of treatment, I-131-N-(3-fluoropropyl)-2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-iodophenyl)nortropane was injected into the rats, and images of DAT in the brain were acquired using a storage phosphor plate. The levels of DAT-specific radioactivity uptake in the bilateral corpora striata (left/right) were compared. Results: There was no difference in DAT-specific radioactivity uptake between the bilateral corpora striata in the sham surgery rats. The images were clear and symmetrically distributed in the corpora striata. In PD model rats, the DAT-specific radioactivity uptake decreased on the lesioned side and the ratios of uptake between the corpora striata were increased. Accumulation of the radioligand on the lesioned side was sparse. In the L-DOPA group, the average ratio values were significantly increased in dyskinetic rats and reduced in nondyskinetic rats. In addition, the differences between the bilateral corpora striata were reduced in nondyskinetic rats. Conclusion: L-DOPA was shown to downregulate DAT in some PD model rats. That process may be involved in the pathogenesis of dyskinesia. Copyright (C) 2011 S.

However, expression level of individual AC isoforms was not analyzed in crucial cell structure, plasma membrane (PM). Methods: Rats were adapted to morphine for 10 days and sacrificed 24 h (group +M10) or 20 days (+M10/-M20) after the last dose. Control animals were sacrificed in parallel with morphine-treated (groups MW and (-M10/-M20)). Percoll (R)-purified PM were isolated from brain cortex and analyzed by immunoblotting and specific radioligand binding. Results: ACI (ACII) was increased 8x (2.5x) in morphine-adapted rats (+M10) when compared with controls (-M10). Increase of ACI and II by long-term adaptation to increasing doses of morphine represented a specific effect as the amount of ACIII-ACIX, of prototypical PM marker, Na, K-ATPase and of trimeric G protein alpha and beta. subunits was unchanged. Increase of ACI and II was not detected in PM isolated from group (+M10/-M20). Thus, the marked increase of ACI and ACII faded away 20 days since the last dose of morphine. Conclusions: We assume that the specific increase in expression level of ACI and ACII in brain cortex of morphine-adapted rats proceeds as a compensatory, homeostatic response to prolonged exposure to inhibitory drug, morphine.

Serotonin transporter binding and genotype in the nonhuman primate brain using [C-11]DASB PET	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; 5-HT1A RECEPTOR-BINDING; FEMALE RHESUS-MONKEYS; EARLY-LIFE STRESS; SEX-DIFFERENCES; GENE POLYMORPHISM; MAJOR DEPRESSION; PROMOTER REGION; EMOTION REGULATION; LINEAR-REGRESSION	The length polymorphism of the serotonin (5-HT) transporter gene promoter region has been implicated in altered 5-HT function and, in turn, neuropsychiatric illnesses, such as anxiety and depression. The nonhuman primate has been used as a model to study anxiety-related mechanisms in humans based upon similarities in behavior and the presence of a similar 5-HT transporter gene polymorphism. Stressful and threatening contexts in the nonhuman primate model have revealed 5-HT transporter genotype dependent differences in regional glucose metabolism. Using the rhesus monkey, we examined the extent to which serotonin transporter genotype is associated with 5-HT transporter binding in brain regions implicated in emotion-related pathology. Methods: Genotype data and high resolution PET scans were acquired in 29 rhesus (Macaca mulatta) monkeys. [C-11]DASB dynamic PET scans were acquired for 90 min in the anesthetized animals and images of distribution volume ratio (DVR) were created to serve as a metric of 5-HT transporter binding for group comparison based on a reference region method of analysis. Regional and voxelwise statistical analysis were performed with corrections for anatomical differences in gray matter probability, sex, age and radioligand mass. Results: There were no significant differences when comparing 1/1 homozygotes with s-carriers in the regions of the brain implicated in anxiety and mood related illnesses (amygdala, striatum, thalamus, raphe nuclei, temporal and prefrontal cortex). There was a significant sex difference in 5-HT transporter binding in all regions with females having 18%-28% higher DVR than males. Conclusions: Because these findings are consistent with similar genotype findings in humans, this further strengthens the use of the rhesus model for studying anxiety-related neuropathologies.

Peripheral and central sites of action for the non-selective cannabinoid agonist WIN 55,212-2 in a rat model of post-operative pain	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						cannabinoid; CB1; CB2; site of action; skin incision; WIN 55; 212-2; mechanical allodynia	PROTEIN-LIKE IMMUNOREACTIVITY; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; SPINAL-CORD; TACTILE ALLODYNIA; CB1 RECEPTORS; IN-VITRO; INDUCED ANTINOCICEPTION; INCISIONAL PAIN; EVOKED ACTIVITY; FORMALIN TEST	Activation of cannabinoid (CB) receptors decreases nociceptive transmission in inflammatory or neuropathic pain states. However, the effects of CB receptor agonists in post-operative pain remain to be investigated. Here, we characterized the anti-allodynic effects of WIN 55,212-2 (WIN) in a rat model of post-operative pain. WIN 55,212-2 was characterized in radioligand binding and in vitro functional assays at rat and human CB1 and CB2 receptors. Analgesic activity and site(s) of action of WIN were assessed in the skin incision-induced post-operative pain model in rats; receptor specificity was investigated using selective CB1 and CB2 receptor antagonists. WIN 55,212-2 exhibited non-selective affinity and agonist efficacy at human and rat CB1 versus CB2 receptors. Systemic administration of WIN decreased injury-induced mechanical allodynia and these effects were reversed by pretreatment with a CB1 receptor antagonist, but not with a CB2 receptor antagonist, given by systemic, intrathecal and supraspinal routes. In addition, peripheral administration of both CB1 and CB2 antagonists blocked systemic WIN-induced analgesic activity. Both CB1 and CB2 receptors were involved in the peripheral anti-allodynic effect of systemic WIN in a pre-clinical model of post-operative pain. In contrast, the centrally mediated anti-allodynic activity of systemic WIN is mostly due to the activation of CB1 but not CB2 receptors at both the spinal cord and brain levels. However, the increased potency of WIN following i.c.v. administration suggests that its main site of action is at CB1 receptors in the brain.

The effect of blocking the chemokine repertoire in human brain microvascular endothelial cells in HIV dementia (HAD) disease has not been reported. Characterizing the nature of HIV-1 envelope protein gp140 (T-tropic, HXBc2) receptor binding conditions to HBMEC is critical to gain insight into the HIV dementia, and eventually to rationally design the agents to block envelope protein receptor interactions. HIV-1 gp140 oligomers were purified and separated to monomers, dimers, and trimers. The binding conditions of gp140 to HBMEC chemokine receptor, CXCR4, were optimized with an aim of understanding the structural interactions in HAD. Analysis of the interaction between HIV-1 gp140 and CXCR4 of HBMEC by saturation binding, cross-competition analysis with radiolabeled SDF and gp 140, revealed a strong interaction, specificity between HIV-1 gp140 and CXCR4. Our binding data demonstrate that HIV-1 envelope protein gp]40 enters cells by protein receptor mediated interactions that are regulated by the conformational state of the gp140 at physiological environment (pH and temperature). The CXCR4 antibody 12G5 inhibited SDF-1 binding to HBMEC indicating the specificity of gp140 binding to HBMEC. Scatchard analysis revealed the presence of approximately 70250 gp140 binding sites per cell with a K-d of 4.5 nM. Cross-competition experiments using labeled SDF-1 and gp 140 revealed that both unlabeled SDF-1 and gp 140 are capable of displacing their radiolabeled counterparts. The binding assay conditions and radioligand binding assay are highly valuable to identify and design better HIV inhibitors for HAD. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The compound was labeled with the short-lived positron emitter F-18 in a single step by nucleophilic displacement of the corresponding tosylate precursor MCL-323 with no-carrieradded [F-18]fluoride. The positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer 20-carbo-2'-[F-18]fluoroethoxy-3p-(4-bromo-phenyl)tropane [F-18]MCL-322 was obtained in decay-corrected radiochemical yields of 30-40% at a specific radioactivity of 1.6-2.4 Ci/mu mol (60-90 GBq/mu mol) at the end-of-synthesis (EOS). Small animal PET, ex vivo and in vivo biodistribution experiments in rats demonstrated a high uptake in the striatum (3.2% ID/g) 5 min after injection, which increased to 4.2% ID/g after 60 min. The uptake in the cerebellum was 1.8% ID/g and 0.6% ID/g after 5 min and 60 min post-injection, respectively. Specific binding to DAT of [F-18]MCL-322 was confirmed by blocking experiments using the high affinity DAT ligand GBR 12909. The radiopharmacological characterization was completed with metabolite and autoradiographic studies confirming the selective uptake of [F-18]MCL-322 in the striatum. It is concluded that the simple single-step radiosynthesis of [F-18]MCL-322 and the promising radiopharmacological data make [F-18]MCL-322 an attractive candidate for the further development of a PET radiotracer potentially suitable for clinical DAT imaging in the human brain.

We studied the mechanism of levobunolol-induced vasodilation in arterial smooth muscle. The effects of levobumolol. or other agents on isolated, pre-contracted rabbit ciliary artery were investigated using an isometric tension recording method. The effects of the same agents on intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+](i)) in cultured human aortic smooth muscle cells were also studied by fluorophotometry. Levobunolol relaxed ciliary artery rings that were pre-contracted with either high-K solution, 1 mu M histamine, 10 mu M phenylephrine, or 100 nM endothelin-1. The relaxation induced by levobunolol was concentration-dependent over the range of 10 mu M to 0.3 mM. Inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthase or denudation of the endothelium did not affect this relaxation. Histamine-induced contractions were inhibited by the histamine H, antagonist pyrilamine. Radioligand binding experiments showed that levobunolol did not bind to the H, receptor. Further, histamine induced transient contraction in Ca2+-free solution, and levobunolol inhibited this contraction by 74.6 +/- 11.0%. In cultured smooth muscle cells in the presence of extracellular Ca2+, levobunolol significantly inhibited the histamine-induced elevation of [Ca2+](i). However, it did not inhibit the increase of [Ca2+](i) in histamine-stimulated cells incubated in Ca2+-free solution. These results indicate that levobunolot may relax rabbit ciliary artery by two different mechanisms. First, the relaxation could be due to the blockade of Ca2+ entry through non-voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. Second, levobunolol may change the Ca2+ sensitivity of vascular smooth muscle cells.

Since its introduction in the early 1990s, imidacloprid has become one of the most extensively used insecticides for both crop protection and animal health applications. As with other classes of insecticides, resistance to neonicotinoids is a significant threat and has been identified in several pest species, including the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens, a major rice pest in many parts of Asia. In this study, radioligand binding experiments have been conducted with whole-body membranes prepared from imidacloprid-susceptible and imidacloprid-resistant strains of N. lugens. The results reveal a much higher level of [H-3]imidacloprid-specific binding to the susceptible strain than to the resistant strain (16.7 +/- 1.0 and 0.34 +/- 0.21 fmol/mg of protein, respectively). With the aim of understanding the molecular basis of imidacloprid resistance, five nAChR subunits (NI alpha 1-NI alpha 4 and NI beta 1) have been cloned from N. lugens. A comparison of nAChR subunit genes from imidacloprid-sensitive and imidacloprid-resistant populations has identified a single point mutation at a conserved position (Y151S) in two nAChR subunits, Mal and MO. A strong correlation between the frequency of the Y151S point mutation and the level of resistance to imidacloprid has been demonstrated by allele-specific PCR. By expression of hybrid nAChRs containing N. lugens alpha and rat beta 2 subunits, evidence was obtained that demonstrates that mutation Y151S is responsible for a substantial reduction in specific [H-3]imidacloprid binding. This study provides direct evidence for the occurrence of target-site resistance to a neonicotinoid insecticide.

This implies that the onset of normal tissue damage is usually determined by tissue turnover rate. Salivary glands are a clear exception to this rule: they have slow turnover rates ( > 60 days), yet develop radiation- induced dysfunction within hours to days. We showed that this could not be explained by a hypersensitivity to radiation- induced apoptosis or necrosis of the differentiated cells. In fact, salivary cells are still capable of amylase secretion shortly after irradiation while at the same time water secretion seems specifically and severely impaired. Here, we demonstrate that salivary gland cells isolated after in vivo irradiation are impaired in their ability to mobilise calcium from intracellular stores (Ca-i(2+)), the driving force for water secretion, after exposure to muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonists. Using radioligand-receptor-binding assays it is shown that radiation caused no changes in receptor density, receptor affinity nor in receptor- G- protein coupling. However, muscarinic acetylcholine agonist- induced activation of protein kinase C alpha ( PKCalpha), measured as translocation to the plasma membrane, was severely affected in irradiated cells. Also, the phorbol ester PMA could no longer induce PKCalpha translocation in irradiated cells. Our data hence indicate that irradiation specifically interferes with PKCalpha association with membranes, leading to impairment of intracellular signalling. To the best of our knowledge, these data for the first time suggest that, the cells' capacity to respond to a receptor agonist is impaired after irradiation.

Strategies have been undertaken to delineate the bioactive domains of GIP with the intention of developing small molecular weight GIP mimetics. The molecular cloning of receptors for GIP and the related hormone GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) has allowed examination of the characteristics of incretin analogs in transfected cell models. The current report examines the N-terminal bioactive domain of GIP residing in residues 1-14 by alanine scanning mutagenesis and N-terminal substitution/modification. Further studies examined peptide chimeras of GIP and GLP-1 designed to localize bioactive determinants of the two hormones. The alanine scan of the GIP(1-14) sequence established that the peptide was extremely sensitive to structural perturbations. Only replacement of amino acids 2 and 13 with those found in glucagon failed to dramatically reduce receptor binding and activation. Of four GIP(1-14) peptides modified by the introduction of DP IV-resistant groups, a peptide with a reduced bond between Ala(2) and Glu(3) demonstrated improved receptor potency compared to native GIP(1-14). The peptide chimera studies supported recent results on the importance of a mid-region helix for bioactivity of GIP, and confirmed existence of two separable regions with independent intrinsic receptor binding and activation proper-ties. Furthermore, peptide chimeras showed that binding of GLP-1 also involves both N- and C-terminal domains, but that it apparently contains only a single bioactive domain in its N-terminus. Together, these results should facilitate development of incretin based therapies using rational drug design for potential treatment of diabetes. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Because they normally mediate an inhibition of neuronal firing, their desensitization is a prerequisite to the delayed enhancement of 5-HT neurotransmission upon treatment with monoamine oxidase (MAOI) inhibitors or specific serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). Using beta-sensitive microprobes in vivo, we measured a significant decrease (-30%) in binding sites for the 5-HT1A PET radioligand [F-18]MPPF associated with an equivalent reduction (-34%) in the cell surface density of 5-HT1A receptor immunoreactivity (internalization), in the nucleus raphe dorsalis (autoreceptors), but not hippocampus (heteroreceptors), of rats given a single dose of the specific 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 8-OH-DPAT (0.5 mg/kg, iv). This effect was completely blocked by pretreatment with the selective 5-HT1A antagonist WAY 100635. Having ruled out that this decreased density of [F-18]MPPF binding in the nucleus raphe dorsalis of 8-OH-DPAT-treated rats resulted from a local blood flow effect, we obtained autoradiographic evidence indicating that the total amount of specific binding of [F-18]MPPF in tissue sections was unaffected by the 8-OH-DPAT treatment in either NRD or hippocampus. It was therefore concluded that the internalization of 5-HT1A autoreceptors accounted for the decreased binding in vivo of [F-18]MPPF in the nucleus raphe dorsalis of rats treated with 8-OH-DPAT. Thus, PET imaging might provide a mean to measure 5-HT1A receptor internalization in human brain and thus assess responsiveness to antidepressant treatment. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

To gain more information on the temporal distribution of SERTs, 2-([2-([dimethylamino]methyl)phenoxyl]thio)-5-[I-123] iodophenylamine (I-123-ADAM) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was utilized in an in vivo imaging study using non-human primates. Methods Two female monkeys (Macaca cyclopis) were studied. Eight brain SPECT imaging examinations, each 30 min in duration, were obtained after injection of (185) MBq of I-123-ADAM. Images were obtained using a dual-head gamma camera equipped with ultra-high resolution fan-beam collimators. In addition to visual inspection, the radio-uptake and specific uptake ratios (SURs) of midbrain (MB), thalamus (TH), striatum (ST), temporal and frontal cortices and the whole brain in reference to the corresponding magnetic resonance image at the eight time points were measured. The SUR of MB, using cerebellum (CB) as the reference tissue, was calculated as (MB-CB)/CB, in mean counts/pixel. The SURs of the other brain regions were similarly measured. Results There was relatively high uptake of I-123-ADAM in the MB and TH, moderate uptake in ST, lower uptake in the cerebral cortex, and almost no uptake in the CB. The image of MB could be easily identified at the first 30 min time point. It appeared that the SURs of MB, TH and ST reached equilibrium around 210 min after injection. No adverse reactions of the primates were found during and after imaging. Brain distribution of I-123-ADAM in the primate appeared consistent with the known distribution of SERTs. Conclusion In conjunction with a high SUR in MB, TH and ST, we speculate that I-123-ADAM may be a potential radioligand for SPECT studies of serotonin transporters in humans.

In the rat urinary bladder (RUB) HEK-1 was about 3 fold less potent than SP. In the rabbit pulmonary artery (RPA) HEK-1 and in the guinea-pig ileum (GPI), HEK-1 was about 500 fold less potent than NKA and NKB, respectively. 4 The responses to HEK-1 were antagonized by GR 82334 in RUB (pK(B)=5.6+/-0.07), by nepadutant in RPA (pK(B)=8.6+/-0.04) and by SR 142801 in GPI (pK(B)=9.0+/-0.2) with apparent affinities comparable to that measured against tachykinin NK1, NK2 and NK3 receptor-selective agonists, respectively. 5 Intravenous HEK-1 produced dose-related decrease of blood pressure in anaesthetized guinea-pigs (ED50 = 0.1 nmol kg (1)) and salivary secretion in anaesthetized rats (ED50 = 6 nmol kg (1)) with potencies similar to that of SP. All these effects were blocked by the selective tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonist. SR 140333. 6 We conclude that HEK-1 is a full agonist at tachykinin NK1, NK2 and NK3 receptors, possesses a remarkable selectivity for NK1 as compared to NK2 or NK3 receptors and acts in vivo experiments with potency similar to that of SP.

The present work aimed to identify the receptor subtype and the cell type accounting for high expression and to clarify the mechanisms responsible for the sharp decrease in hepatic receptivity occurring during the late stage of foetal development. 2 Binding experiments indicated that the density of alpha2-adrenoceptors in the foetal liver (embryonic day 18; 615 +/- 155 fmol mg(-1) of protein) is 18 fold higher than in newborn or adult (35.21 +/-4.3 fmol mg(-1)). A high amount of receptor is also found in the placenta (443 +/- 53 fmol mg(-1)). In both tissues, the rank order of antagonists to inhibit radioligand binding matched the pharmacological profile of the alpha 2B-adrenoceptor and exclusively RNG transcripts were detected by RNase protection assays. 3 Isolation of cell fractions from foetal liver showed that alpha 2B-adrenoceptor is primarily expressed by haematopoietic cells. Consistent with this view, the receptor is found to be abundant in foetal blood. carried by reticulocytes. The expression in blood gradually declines to zero at 3 weeks of age and it is not recovered following induction of reticulocytosis in adults. 4 In foetal reticulocytes, a low proportion of the receptor population is coupled to G-protein. The alpha2-agonist UK14304 has a marginal effect on cyclic AMP level but significantly increases arachidonic acid release. The function of the receptor remains to be elucidated. However, together with observations on alpha 2B-knockout mice, the current finding strongly suggests a role for alpha 2B-adrenoceptor during foetal haematopoiesis in rodents.

A single dose of EEDQ (4 mg/kg body wt., i.p.) significantly inactivated 5-HT1A receptors, as measured by [H-3]8-hydroxy-2-[di-n-propylamino]tetralin ([H-3]8-OH-DPAT), in cortex (64%, p < 0.0001) and hippocampus (48%, p < 0.0001). A significant (p < 0.01) increase in the affinity of 5-HT1A receptors for radioligand was observed in both regions. A dose dependent protection of cortical 5-HT1A receptors from EEDQ inactivation with pre-treatment of different doses of 8-OH-DPAT (4-20 mg/kg) was observed, along with recovery of affinity of [H-3]8-OH-DPAT for 5-HT1A receptors in both regions. Although, a dose of 4 mg/kg of 8-OH-DPAT failed to attenuate the effect of EEDQ on hippocampal 5-HT1A receptors, a significant protection of these receptors was observed with 10 and 20 mg/kg of 8-OH-DPAT. Displacement studies revealed that EEDQ has more affinity for cortical (Ki = 101.3 +/- 11.8 nM) than hippocampal (Ki = 133.5 +/- 25.8 nM) 5-HT1A receptors. A time dependent natural recovery of 5-HT1A receptors from inactivation by a single dose of EEDQ (4 mg/kg) was observed more in cortex compared to hippocampus over a period from I day to 14 days. The results of this study suggest that 8-OH-DPAT inhibited EEDQ inactivation of cortical and hippocampal 5-HT1A receptors in a concentration dependent manner. The synthesis and turnover of 5-HT1A receptors differ in cortex and hippocampus, as evident by earlier recovery in the cortex.

Recently developed antagonists of this receptor were compared to a conventional antagonist, Ac-Lys-[Leu(8)]-des-Arg(9)-BK, in pharmacological assays based on the rabbit BI receptor. 2 B-9858 (Lys-Lys-[Hyp(3), Igl(5), D-Igl(7), Oic(8)]des-Arg(9)-BK) and three other analogues possessing the alpha -2-indanylglycine(5) (Igl(5)) residue (order of potency B-9858 approximate to B-10146> B-10148> B-10050) were partially insurmountable antagonists of des-Arg(9)-BK in the contractility assay based on rabbit aortic rings. B-9858-induced depression of the maximal effect was more pronounced in tissues treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide to block the spontaneous increase of response attributed to the post-isolation formation of B-1 receptors, and only partly reversible on washing. 3 By comparison, Ac-Lys-[Leu(8)]des-Arg(9)-BK was a surmountable antagonist (pA(2) 7.5), even in cycloheximide-treated tissues. B-9958 (Lys-[Hyp(3), CpG(5), D-Tic(7), CpG(8)]des-Arg(9)-BK) was also surmountable (pA(2) 8.5). 4 The binding of [H-3]-Lys-desArg(9)-BK to recombinant rabbit BI receptors expressed in COS-I cells was influenced by two of the antagonists: while Ac-Lys-[Leu(8)]des-Arg9-BK competed for the radioligand binding without affecting the B-max, B-9858 decreased the B-max, in a time-dependent and washout-resistant manner. 5 B-9858 and analogues possessing Igl(5) are the first reported non-competitive, non-equilibrium antagonists of the kinin B-1 receptor.

However, the high pancreas uptake of reported GRPR-targeting radioligands limits their clinical application. Our goal was to develop Ga-68-labeled agonist tracers for detecting GRPR-expressing tumors with positron emission tomography (PET), and compare them with the clinically validated agonist PET tracer, [Ga-68]Ga-AMBA. Ga-TacBOMB2, TacBOMB3, and TacBOMB4, derived from [Thz(14)]Bombesin(7-14), were confirmed to be GRPR agonists by a calcium mobilization study, and their binding affinities (K-i(GRPR)) were determined to be 7.62 +/- 0.19, 6.02 +/- 0.59, and 590 +/- 36.5 nM, respectively, via in vitro competition binding assays. [Ga-68]Ga-TacBOMB2, [Ga-68]Ga-TacBOMB3, and [Ga-68]Ga-AMBA clearly visualized PC-3 tumor xenografts in a PET imaging study. [Ga-68]Ga-TacBOMB2 showed comparable tumor uptake but superior tumor-to-background contrast ratios when compared to [Ga-68]Ga-AMBA. Moreover, [Ga-68]Ga-TacBOMB2 and [Ga-68]Ga-TacBOMB3 showed a much lower rate of uptake in the pancreas (1.30 +/- 0.14 and 2.41 +/- 0.72%ID/g, respectively) than [Ga-68]Ga-AMBA (62.4 +/- 4.26%ID/g). In conclusion, replacing Met(14) in the GRPR-targeting sequence with Thz(14) retains high GRPR-binding affinity and agonist properties. With good tumor uptake and tumor-to-background uptake ratios, [Ga-68]Ga-TacBOMB2 is promising for detecting GRPR-expressing tumors. The much lower pancreas uptake of [Ga-68]Ga-TacBOMB2 and [Ga-68]Ga-TacBOMB3 suggests that [Thz(14)]Bombesin(7-14) is a promising targeting vector for the design of GRPR-targeting radiopharmaceuticals, especially for radioligand therapy application.

Imaging of C-X-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 4 Expression in 690 Patients with Solid or Hematologic Neoplasms Using 68Ga-Pentixafor PET	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						CXCR4; C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4; (68)GaPentixafor; PET	HUMAN CANCER XENOGRAFTS; CELL LUNG-CANCER; CXCR4 EXPRESSION; MULTIPLE-MYELOMA; CXCR4-DIRECTED ENDORADIOTHERAPY; PENTIXATHER; EXPERIENCE; LEUKEMIA; PEPTIDE	In recent years, molecular imaging addressing the C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) has increasingly been used in various clinical settings. Here, we aimed to assess radiopharmaceutical uptake and image contrast to determine the most relevant clinical applications for CXCR4-directed imaging. We also investigated the impact of specific activity on scan contrast. Methods: Patients (n = 690) with a variety of neoplasms underwent a total of 777 PET/CT scans with Ga-68-Pentixafor, serving as the CXCR4-specific radioligand. A semiquantitative target lesion analysis was conducted (providing SUVmax and targetto-blood pool ratio [TBR], defined as SUVmax [from target lesion] divided by SUVmean [from blood pool]). The applied specific activity (in MBq/mg) was compared with semiquantitative assessments. Results: Of the 777 scans, 242 did not show discernible uptake in disease sites, leaving 535 PET scans (68.9%) for further analysis. Very high tracer uptake (SUVmax > 12) was found in multiple myeloma (n = 113), followed by adrenocortical carcinoma (n = 30), mantle cell lymphoma (n = 20), adrenocortical adenoma (n = 6), and small cell lung cancer (n = 12). Providing information on image contrast, comparable results for TBR were recorded, with TBR (>8) in multiple myeloma, mantle cell lymphoma, and acute lymphoblastoid leukemia (n = 6). When comparing specific activity with semiquantitative parameters, no significant correlation was found for SUVmax or TBR (P >= 0.612). Conclusion: In this large cohort, Ga-68-Pentixafor demonstrated high image contrast in a variety of neoplasms, particularly for hematologic malignancies, small cell lung cancer, and adrenocortical neoplasms. The present analysis may provide a roadmap for detecting patients who may benefit from CXCR4-targeted therapies.

A Multi-Ligand Imaging Study Exploring GABAergic Receptor Expression and Inflammation in Multiple Sclerosis	MOLECULAR IMAGING AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						GABA(A) receptor binding; Multiple sclerosis; Positron emission tomography; Flumazenil; PK11195; Neuroinflammation	IN-VIVO; GRAPHICAL ANALYSIS; INHIBITORY ROLE; PET; BINDING; MICROGLIA; SURFACE; GABA; RADIOLIGAND; ASTROCYTES	Purpose The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter and essential for normal brain function. The GABAergic system has been shown to have immunomodulatory effects and respond adaptively to excitatory toxicity. The association of the GABAergic system and inflammation in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) remains unknown. In this pilot study, the in vivo relationship between GABA(A) binding and the innate immune response is explored using positron emission tomography (PET) with [C-11] flumazenil (FMZ) and [C-11]-PK11195 PET (PK-PET), a measure of activated microglia/macrophages. Procedures Sixteen MS patients had dynamic FMZ-PET and PK-PET imaging. Ten age-matched healthy controls (HC) had a single FMZ-PET. GABA(A) receptor binding was calculated using Logan reference model with the pons as reference. Distribution of volume ratio (VTr) for PK-PET was calculated using image-derived input function. A hierarchical linear model was fitted to assess the linear association between PK-PET and FMZ-PET among six cortical regions of interest. Results GABA(A) receptor binding was higher throughout the cortex in MS patients (5.72 +/- 0.91) as compared with HC (4.70 +/- 0.41) (p = 0.002). A significant correlation was found between FMZ binding and PK-PET within the cortex (r = 0.61, p < 0.001) and among the occipital (r = 0.61, p = 0.012), parietal (r = 0.49, p = 0.041), and cingulate (r = 0.32, p = 0.006) regions. Conclusions A higher GABA(A) receptor density in MS subjects compared with HC was observed and correlated with innate immune activity. Our observations demonstrate that immune-driven GABAergic abnormalities may be present in MS.

A putative relationship between markers for the serotonin system and the personality scale self-transcendence (ST) and its subscale spiritual acceptance (SA) has been demonstrated in a previous PET study of 5-HT1A receptor binding in healthy control subjects. The results could however not be replicated in a subsequent PET study at an independent centre. In this study, we performed a replication of our original study in a larger sample using Bayesian hypothesis testing to evaluate relative evidence both for and against this hypothesis. Methods. Regional 5-HT1A receptor binding potential (BPND) was examined in 50 healthy male subjects using PET with the radioligand [C-11]WAY100635. 5-HT1A availability was calculated using the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) yielding regional BPND. ST and SA were measured using the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) questionnaire. Correlations between ST/SA scores and 5-HT1A BPND in frontal cortex, hippocampus and raphe nuclei were examined by calculation of default correlation Bayes factors (BFs) and replication BFs. Results. There were no significant correlations between 5-HT1A receptor binding and ST/SA scores. Rather, five of six replication BFs provided moderate to strong evidence for no association between 5-HT1A availability and ST/SA, while the remaining BF provided only weak evidence. Conclusion. We could not replicate our previous findings of an association between 5-HT1A availability and the personality trait ST/SA. Rather, the Bayesian analysis provided evidence for a lack of correlation. Further research should focus on whether other components of the serotonin system may be related to ST or SA. This study also illustrates how Bayesian hypothesis testing allows for greater flexibility and more informative conclusions than traditional p-values, suggesting that this approach may be advantageous for analysis of molecular imaging data.

In Vitro Pharmacological Characterization and In Vivo Validation of LSN3172176 a Novel M1 Selective Muscarinic Receptor Agonist Tracer Molecule for Positron Emission Tomography	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							POSITIVE ALLOSTERIC MODULATOR; ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; HUMAN BRAIN; COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION; CHOLINERGIC SYSTEM; RHESUS-MONKEY; MUTANT MICE; MEMORY; DONEPEZIL	In the search for improved symptomatic treatment options for neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases, muscarinic acetylcholine M1 receptors (M1 mAChRs) have received significant attention. Drug development efforts have identified a number of novel ligands, some of which have advanced to the clinic. However, a significant issue for progressing these therapeutics is the lack of robust, translatable, and validated biomarkers. One valuable approach to assessing target engagement is to use positron emission tomography (PET) tracers. In this study we describe the pharmacological characterization of a selective M1 agonist amenable for in vivo tracer studies. We used a novel direct binding assay to identify nonradiolabeled ligands, including LSN3172176, with the favorable characteristics required for a PET tracer. In vitro functional and radioligand binding experiments revealed that LSN3172176 was a potent partial agonist (EC50 2.4-7.0 nM, E-max 43%-73%), displaying binding selectivity for M1 mAChRs (K-d = 1.5 nM) that was conserved across species (native tissue K-d = 1.02, 2.66, 8, and 1.03 at mouse, rat, monkey, and human, respectively). Overall selectivity of LSN3172176 appeared to be a product of potency and stabilization of the high-affinity state of the M1 receptor, relative to other mAChR subtypes (M1 > M2, M4, M5 > M3). In vivo, use of wild-type and mAChR knockout mice further supported the M1-preferring selectivity profile of LSN3172176 for the M1 receptor (78% reduction in cortical occupancy in M1 KO mice). These findings support the development of LSN3172176 as a potential PET tracer for assessment of M1 mAChR target engagement in the clinic and to further elucidate the function of M1 mAChRs in health and disease.

The importance of small polar radiometabolites in molecular neuroimaging: A PET study with [<SUP>11</SUP>C]Cimbi-36 labeled in two positions	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						[C-11]Cimbi-36; 5-HT2A receptor; labeling position; positron emission tomography; polar radiometabolites	BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; RECEPTOR AGONIST BINDING; P-GLYCOPROTEIN FUNCTION; METABOLIC-FATE; CARBON-DIOXIDE; PLASMA; TRACER; QUANTIFICATION; C-11-ORM-13070; PERMEABILITY	[C-11]Cimbi-36, a 5-HT2A receptor agonist PET radioligand, contains three methoxy groups amenable to [C-11]-labeling. In pigs, [C-11]Cimbi-36 yields a polar (M1) and a less polar (M2) radiometabolite fraction, while changing the labeling to [C-11]Cimbi-36_5 yields only the M1 fraction. We investigate whether changing the labeling position of [C-11]Cimbi-36 eliminates M2 in humans, and if this changes the signal-to-background ratio. Six healthy volunteers each underwent two dynamic PET scans; after injection of [C-11]Cimbi-36, both the M1 and M2 fraction appeared in plasma, whereas only the M1 appeared after [C-11]Cimbi-36_5 injection. [C-11]Cimbi-36_5 generated higher uptake than [C-11]Cimbi-36 in both neocortex and cerebellum. With the simplified reference tissue model mean neocortical non-displaceable binding potential for [C-11]Cimbi-36 was 1.38 +/- 0.07, whereas for [C-11]Cimbi-36_5, it was 1.18 +/- 0.14. This significant difference can be explained by higher non-displaceable binding caused by demethylation products in the M1 fraction such as [C-11]formaldehyde and/or [C-11]carbon dioxide/bicarbonate. Although often considered without any impact on binding measures, we show that small polar radiometabolites can substantially decrease the signal-to-background ratio of PET radioligands for neuroimaging. Further, we find that [C-11]Cimbi-36 has a better signal-to-background ratio than [C-11]Cimbi-36_5, and thus will be more sensitive to changes in 5-HT2A receptor levels in the brain.

Whole-body biodistribution of the cannabinoid type 1 receptor ligand [<SUP>18</SUP>F]MK-9470 in the rat	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Cannabinoid type 1 receptor; [F-18]MK-9470; Whole-body biodistribution; MicroPET; Rat	SMALL ANIMAL PET; CB1 RECEPTOR; ENDOCANNABINOID SYSTEM; AVAILABILITY; DOSIMETRY; RADIOLIGAND; ANOREXIA; HUMANS; TRACER	The endocannabinoid system participates in many processes in the body, including memory, reward, pain, motor activity, food intake, energy metabolism, and gastrointestinal functions. [F-18]MK-9470 is a positron emission tomography (PET) ligand that binds with high affinity and selectivity to the cannabinoid type 1 receptor. In order to fully characterize ligand behavior, tracer uptake measured using in vivo microPET was compared with results from ex vivo tissue dissection. Twelve male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three subgroups and scanned over time periods of 10 min, 30 min and 90 min using PET. Afterwards, a number of the animals' organs were dissected. Uptake of radioactivity was expressed in terms of %1D/ml and %ID/(g tissue). For comparison of in vivo and ex vivo methods, Bland Altman plots were computed. The highest uptake of [F-18]MK-9470 was found in the liver and small intestine; the brain showed less uptake, while low and unspecific binding was observed in tissue of the heart, lung, kidney and bone. In the brain, normalized uptake of [F-18]MK-9470 was on average 0.25%ID/ml (range: 0.16 to 0.28%ID/ml). Bland-Altman plots revealed the best agreement between methods for the 90 min acquisition protocols. High hepatic accumulation and metabolism of [F-18]MK-9470 occur with mainly enteral excretion, which may vary considerably over time a finding which may be of relevance in metabolite determination in quantitative brain studies. Comparisons between in vivo and ex vivo methods showed that whole-body distribution of [F-18]MK-9470 using positron emission tomography is a preferable alternative to ex vivo biodistribution, and requires a significantly smaller number of animals.

It is known that factors such as peripheral infections and stress can influence immune processes in the brain. However, the effect of these stressors on astrocyte activation in vivo remains elusive. In this study, transgenic Gfap-luc mice expressing the luciferase gene under the transcriptional control of the glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter were used to quantify the kinetics of in vivo astrocyte activation following immune challenges relevant to clinical inflammation. It was found that astrocytes respond rapidly to peripheral immune activation elicited by either bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or the viral mimetic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)). By measuring bioluminescence and 18-kDa translocator protein radioligand binding in the same animal it was observed that LPS induces both astrocyte as well as microglial activation at 6 h post-administration. Furthermore, the astrocyte response decreased upon repeated systemic LPS injections, indicating development of tolerance to the LPS challenge. Finally, restraining Gfap-luc mice for 1 h daily on 5 consecutive days did not affect brain bioluminescence, thereby indicating that sub-chronic stress does not influence astrocyte activation under unchallenged conditions. However, stressed animals showed a reduced response to a subsequent systemic LPS injection, suggesting that the immune system is compromised in these animals. Here, we demonstrate that Gfap-luc mice can be used to study astrocyte activation in response to stimuli relevant for clinical inflammation and that this approach may provide a more complete characterization of existing and novel models of neuroinflammation.

Exploring the Interaction of SV2A with Racetams Using Homology Modelling, Molecular Dynamics and Site-Directed Mutagenesis	PLOS ONE			English	Article							VESICLE PROTEIN 2A; SECONDARY STRUCTURE; BINDING-SITE; FORCE-FIELD; PREDICTION; EFFICIENT; LEVETIRACETAM; TRANSPORTER; LOCALIZATION; MECHANISM	The putative Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) transporter, SV2A, is the target for levetiracetam (LEV), which is a successful anti-epileptic drug. Furthermore, SV2A knock out mice display a severe seizure phenotype and die after a few weeks. Despite this, the mode of action of LEV is not known at the molecular level. It would be extremely desirable to understand this more fully in order to aid the design of improved anti-epileptic compounds. Since there is no structure for SV2A, homology modelling can provide insight into the ligand-binding site. However, it is not a trivial process to build such models, since SV2A has low sequence identity to those MFS transporters whose structures are known. A further level of complexity is added by the fact that it is not known which conformational state of the receptor LEV binds to, as multiple conformational states have been inferred by tomography and ligand binding assays or indeed, if binding is exclusive to a single state. Here, we explore models of both the inward and outward facing conformational states of SV2A (according to the alternating access mechanism for MFS transporters). We use a sequence conservation analysis to help guide the homology modelling process and generate the models, which we assess further with Molecular Dynamics (MD). By comparing the MD results in conjunction with docking and simulation of a LEV-analogue used in radioligand binding assays, we were able to suggest further residues that line the binding pocket. These were confirmed experimentally. In particular, mutation of D670 leads to a complete loss of binding. The results shed light on the way LEV analogues may interact with SV2A and may help with the ongoing design of improved anti-epileptic compounds.

Sensitivity to μ-opioid receptor-mediated anti-nociception is determined by cross-regulation between μ- and δ-opioid receptors at supraspinal level	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						anti-nociception; opioids; inter-individual variability; opioid receptors; rats; opioid receptors interactions; supraspinal	G-PROTEIN FUSIONS; MORPHINE SENSITIVITY; INDUCED ANALGESIA; ACUTE TOLERANCE; KNOCKOUT MICE; MOUSE-BRAIN; RAT-BRAIN; ANTINOCICEPTION; BINDING; ANTAGONIST	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The perception of pain and its inhibition varies considerably between individuals, and this variability is still unexplained. The aim of the present study is to determine whether functional interactions between opioid receptors are involved in the inter-individual variability in the sensitivity to mu-opioid receptor agonists. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Anti-nociceptive tests, radioligand binding, stimulation of [35S]GTP-g-S binding, inhibition of cAMP production and co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed in two strains of rat (Sprague-Dawley bred at our university -SDU and Wistar) that differ in their sensitivity to opioids. KEY RESULTS The increased anti-nociceptive potency of m-opioid receptor agonists in SDU rats was reversed by the d-opioid receptor antagonist, naltrindole. Inhibition of the binding of [3H] naltrindole by m-opioid receptor agonists was different in brain membranes from SDU and Wistar rats. Differences were also evident in the effect of d-opioid receptor ligands on the binding of [35S] GTP-g-S stimulated by m-opioid receptors agonists. No strain-related differences were detected in spinal cord membranes. The potency of morphine to inhibit cAMP production in brain membranes varied between the strains, in the presence of deltorphin II and naltrindole. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that d-opioid receptors were associated with m-opioid receptors to a higher extent in brain synaptosomal fractions from SDU than in those from Wistar rats. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS There was increased supraspinal cross-talk between m and d-opioid receptors in SDU, as compared with Wistar rats. This was related to an enhanced sensitivity to anti-nociception induced by m-opioid receptor agonists.	[Ballesta, J. J.; Cremades, J.; Faura, C.

However, the numerous side effects produced by the GABA(B) receptor agonist baclofen considerably limit the therapeutic use of this compound. The identification of positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of the GABA(B) receptor may constitute a novel approach in the pharmacological manipulation of the GABA(B) receptor, leading to fewer side effects. The present study reports the identification of two novel compounds, methyl 2-(1-adamantanecarboxamido)-4-ethyl-5-methylthiophene-3-carboxylate (COR627) and methyl 2-(cyclohexanecarboxamido)-4-ethyl-5-methylthiophene-3-carboxylate (COR628), which act as GABA(B) PAMs in 1) rat cortical membranes and 2) in vivo assay. Both compounds potentiated GABA-and baclofen-stimulated guanosine 5'-O-(3-[S-35]thio)-triphosphate binding to native GABA(B) receptors, while producing no effect when given alone. GABA concentration-response curves in the presence of fixed concentrations of COR627 and COR628 revealed an increase of potency of GABA rather than its maximal efficacy. In radioligand binding experiments [displacement of the GABA(B) receptor antagonist, 3-N-[1-((S)-3,4dichlorophenyl)-ethylaminol]-2-(S)hydroxypropyl cyclo-hexylmethyl phosphinic acid ([H-3]CGP54626)], both COR627 and COR628 increased the affinity of high-and low-affinity binding sites for GABA, producing no effect when administered alone up to a concentration of 1 mM. In vivo experiments indicated that pretreatment with per se ineffective doses of COR627 and COR628 potentiated the sedative/hypnotic effect of baclofen. In conclusion, COR627 and COR628 may represent two additional tools for use in investigating the roles and functions of positive allosteric modulatory binding sites of the GABA(B) receptor.

But it is controversial whether cardiomyocytes themselves actually express A(2B)AR. The present study tested whether A(2B)AR could be demonstrated on rat cardiomyocytes. Isolated rat hearts experienced 30 min of ischemia and 120 min of reperfusion. The highly selective, cell-permeant A(2B)AR agonist BAY60-6583 (500 nM) infused at reperfusion reduced infarct size from 40.4 +/- A 2.0% of the risk zone in control hearts to 19.9 +/- A 2.8% indicating that A(2B)AR are protective in rat heart as well. Furthermore, BAY60-6583 reduced calcium-induced mitochondrial permeability transition in isolated rat cardiomyocytes. A(2B)AR protein could be demonstrated in isolated cardiomyocytes by western blotting. In addition, message for A(2B)AR was found in individual cardiomyocytes using quantitative RT-PCR. Surprisingly, immunofluorescence microscopy did not show A(2B)AR on the cardiomyocyte's sarcolemma but rather at intracellular sites. Co-staining with MitoTracker Red in isolated cardiomyocytes revealed A(2B)AR are localized to mitochondria. Western blot analysis of a mitochondrial fraction from either rat heart biopsies or isolated cardiomyocytes revealed a strong A(2B)AR band. Thus, the present study demonstrates that activation of A(2B)AR is strongly cardioprotective in rat heart and suppresses transition pores in isolated cardiomyocytes, and A(2B)AR are expressed in individual cardiomyocytes. However, surprisingly, A(2B)AR are present in or near mitochondria rather than on the sarcolemma as are other adenosine receptors. Because A(2B)AR signaling is thought to result in inhibition of mitochondrial transition pores, this convenient location may be important.

Effects of Synephrine and β-Phenethylamine on Human α-Adrenoceptor Subtypes	PLANTA MEDICA			English	Article						synephrine; beta-phenethylamine; alpha-adrenoceptors; partial agonist; radioligand binding assay; cyclic-AMP	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; SYMPATHOMIMETIC AMINES; RECEPTOR SUBTYPES; STEREOISOMERS; ALKALOIDS; PHARMACOLOGY; OCTOPAMINE; EPHEDRA; OBESITY	Synephrine and beta-phenethylamine, two naturally occurring compounds, are structurally related to ephedrine. In this study, the effects of synephrine and beta-phenethylamine on alpha-adrenergic receptor (alpha-AR) subtypes are investigated in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) or Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and compared to that of 1R,2S-norephedrine. The rank order of binding affinities was found to be the same for the subtypes tested (alpha(1A)-, alpha(2A)-, and alpha(2C)-AR) viz, 1R,2S-norephedrine > beta-phenethylamine > synephrine. Functional studies on the alpha(1A)-AR subtype showed that synephrine was a partial agonist giving a maximal response at 100 mu M that was equal to 55.3% of the L-phenylephrine maximum. In contrast, neither 1R, 2S-norephedrine nor beta-phenethylamine exhibited agonist activity at the highest concentration tested (300 mu M). beta-Phenethylamine was more potent as an antagonist than 1R,2S-norephedrine and synephrine on the alpha(1A)-AR subtype. Functional studies on the alpha(2A)- and alpha(2C)-AR subtypes indicated that synephrine and beta-phenethylamine did not act as agonists. Similar to 1R,2S-norephedrine, both of these analogs reversed the effect of medetomidine against forskolin-induced cAMP elevations at 300 mu M, and the rank order of antagonist potency was: 1R,2S-norephedrine = beta-phenethylamine > synephrine; and beta-phenethylamine > 1R,2S-norephedrine > synephrine, respectively. These differences suggest that the presence of a 4-hydroxy group, as in synephrine, reduced the potency in these subtypes. In conclusion, at the alpha(1A)-AR, synephrine acted as a partial agonist, while beta-phenethylamine did not exhibit any direct agonist activity. Both, synephrine and beta-phenethylamine, may act as antagonists of presynaptic alpha(2A/2C)-ARs present in nerve terminals.

Quantitative autoradiography was used to determine the level of radioligand binding to the D1 and D2 receptors and DAT labeled with CHJSCH23390, [H-3]raclopride, and [H-3]mazindol, respectively in triple-opioid receptor knockout (KO) and WT maintained on C57BL/6 (B6) and 129/SvEvTac (129) as well as C57BL/6 x 129/SvPas (B6 x 129) strains. No significant genotype effect was observed in D1, D2 receptors and DAT binding in any regions analyzed in any of the strains studied, suggesting that a lack of all three opioid receptors does not influence D1, D2 receptors and DAT expression, irrespective of their genetic strain background. However, strain differences were observed in D1 binding between the three strains of mice studied. Lower levels of D1 binding were observed in the substantia nigra of B6 x 129 WT mice compared with the 129 WT mice and in the olfactory tubercle of B6 x 129 WT compared with B6 WT and 129 WT mice. Lower levels of D1 binding were observed in the caudate putamen of B6 x 129 KO mice compared with 129 KO mice. In contrast, no significant strain differences were observed in D2 and DAT binding between the three strains of mice in any regions analyzed. Overall, these results indicate a lack of modulation of the dopaminergic system by the deletion of all three opioid receptors regardless of different background strains. Synapse 64:520-527, 2010.

Cholera Toxin-Sensitive GTP-Binding Protein-Coupled Activation of Augmenter of Liver Regeneration (ALR) Receptor and Its Function in Rat Kupffer Cells	JOURNAL OF CELLULAR PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							HEPATIC STIMULATORY SUBSTANCE; NITRIC-OXIDE; PARTIAL-HEPATECTOMY; GROWTH-FACTORS; CULTURED-HEPATOCYTES; DNA-SYNTHESIS; GENE; MICE; EXPRESSION; APOPTOSIS	Mitogenic effect of augmenter of liver regeneration (ALR), a protein produced and released by hepatocytes, on hepatocytes in vivo but not in vitro suggests that the effect is mediated by nonparenchymal cells. Since mediators produced by Kupffer cells are implicated in hepatic regeneration, we investigated receptor for ALR and its functions in rat Kupffer cells. Kupffer cells were isolated from rat liver by enzymatic digestion and centrifugal elutriation. Radioligand ([(125)I] ALR) receptor binding, ALR-induced GTP/G-protein association, and nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) synthesis were determined. High-affinity receptor for ALR, belonging to the G-protein family, with K(d) of 1.25 +/- 0.18 nM and B(max) of 0.26 +/- 0.02 fmol/mu g DNA was identified. ALR stimulated NO, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 synthesis via cholera toxin-sensitive G-protein, as well as p38-MAPK activity and nuclear translocation of NF kappa B. While inhibitor of NF kappa B (MG132) inhibited ALR-induced NO synthesis, MG132 and p38-MAPK inhibitor (SB203580) abrogated ALR-induced TNF-alpha and IL-6 synthesis. ALR also prevented the release of mediator(s) from Kupffer cells that cause inhibition of DNA synthesis in hepatocytes. Administration of ALR to 40% partially hepatectomized rats increased expression of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and caused augmentation of hepatic regeneration. These results demonstrate specific G-protein coupled binding of ALR and its function in Kupffer cells and suggest that mediators produced by ALR-stimulated Kupffer cells may elicit physiologically important effects on hepatocytes.

Comparison of three assays for the detection of GAD65Ab-specific anti-idiotypic antibodies	JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGICAL METHODS			English	Article						Anti-idiotypic antibodies; Radioligand binding assay; Glutamate decarboxylase; Autoantibodies; Type 1 diabetes; ECL	SYSTEMIC-LUPUS-ERYTHEMATOSUS; ANTI-DNA ANTIBODIES; P AUTOANTIBODIES; GAD65; DECARBOXYLASE; INDIVIDUALS	Anti-idiotypic antibodies (anti-Id) to autoantibodies are present in several autoimmune diseases and are hypothesized to have regulatory function. Recently we reported the presence of anti-Id to a major type 1 diabetes-associated autoantibody (CAD65Ab) in sera of healthy individuals. Our current assay for the detection of GAD65Ab-specific anti-Id requires the initial removal of anti-Id from the sera using immobilized monoclonal GAD65Ab, followed by detection of the now exposed GAD65Ab. However, anti-Id in samples that are GAD65Ab-negative cannot be detected in this assay. Furthermore, we cannot distinguish between serum GAD65Ab and the monoclonal GAD65Ab used in the absorption of anti-Id. In this study we evaluated two novel detection assays for GAD65Ab-specific anti-Id. The biotin/streptavidin based absorption assay utilizes the strong interaction of biotin and streptavidin to prevent possible leakage of the immobilized antibody. Moreover, this assay format allows to identify the origin of the detected GAD65Ab. The ECL-based assay allows the direct detection of anti-Id independent of the presence of GAD65Ab. We analyzed new-onset type 1 diabetes patients (n = 133) and matched healthy controls (n = 178) for the presence of GAD65Ab-specific anti-Id using both new detection assays and the original absorption assay. We found that all three assays can distinguish between the type 1 diabetes cohort and the healthy control samples. The biotin/streptavidin assay allowed us to positively exclude the monoclonal GAD65Ab as the source of the detected GAD65Ab. While the original absorption assay showed the highest sensitivity and specificity, the ECL format showed the highest peak signal-to-noise ratio and excellent linear correlation, making this assay our first choice for quantification of anti-Id.

In this study we investigated the tachykinin receptors in the Xenopus gastrointestinal tract. In functional studies using stomach circular muscle strips, all peptides had similar potencies (EC50 values 1-7 nM). The rank order of potency to contract the intestine was physalaemin (EC50 1 nM)greater than or equal tobufokinin (EC50 3 nM)>substance P (SP)greater than or equal tocod SP>NKA>>X-NKA (EC50 1,900 nM). No maximum response could be obtained for [Sar(9),Met(O-2)(11)]SP, eledoisin and kassinin. In stomach strips, the mammalian tachykinin receptor antagonists RP 67580 (NK1) and MEN 10376 (NK2) had agonistic effects but did not antagonize bufokinin or X-NKA. In intestinal strips, RP 67580 (1 muM) reduced the maximal response to X-NKA but not bufokinin, while MEN 10376 was ineffective. [I-125]BH-bufokinin bound with high affinity to a single class of sites, of K-D 213+/-35 (stomach) and 172+/-9.3 pM (intestine). Specific binding of [I-125]BH-bufokinin was displaced by bufokiningreater than or equal toSP>NKAgreater than or equal toeledoisinapproximate tokassinin>X-NKA, indicating binding to a tachykinin NK1-like receptor. Selective tachykinin receptor antagonists were weak or ineffective. Other iodinated tachykinins ([I-125]NKA and [I-125]BH-eledoisin) displayed biphasic competition profiles, with the majority of sites preferring bufokinin rather than X-NKA. In conclusion, there is evidence for two different tachykinin receptors in Xenopus gastrointestinal tract. Both receptors may exist in stomach, whereas the bufokinin-preferring NK1-like receptor predominates in longitudinal muscle of the small intestine. Antagonists appear to interact differently with amphibian receptors, compared with mammalian receptors.

The serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine-1A (5-HT1A) receptor subtype has been suggested to play a role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and is one among several central neuroreceptors for which clozapine has moderate affinity in vitro. Objective: The aim of this positron emission tomography (PET) study was to determine 5-HT1A receptor occupancy in the monkey brain after IV injection of clozapine in doses that previously have been shown to give plasma concentrations representative of the 200 to 800 mg oral dose range recommended for clinical management of patients. Methods: Each of four cynomolgus monkeys was examined three times on the same day with PET and the radioligand [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635. The first measurement was performed at baseline conditions, the second after clozapine 1.5 mg/kg and the third after 6 mg/kg. Two additional monkeys were examined at baseline and after 15 mg/kg IV. Central 5-HT1A receptor occupancy was calculated using an equilibrium-ratio analysis. Results: The occupancy ranged from 23 to 34% after 1.5 mg/kg clozapine and from 36 to 49% after 6 mg/kg in different brain regions of the four monkeys. The regional receptor occupancy values after 15 mg/kg were between 39 and 51% in the two monkeys. There was no evident difference between the frontal cortex, the temporal cortex and the raphe nucleus. Conclusion: The study shows that clozapine occupies 5-HT1A receptors in the primate brain at clinically representative plasma concentrations. The results support that the 5-HT1A receptor is a candidate target for the atypical drug actions of clozapine.

Therefore, we investigated the effect of the Glu298Asp (E298D) mutation on the function of purified recombinant eNOS expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris. Wild type (WT) and mutant exhibited comparable affinities for L-arginine (K-m values 4.4 +/- 0.6 and 5.2 +/- 0.8 muM, respectively) and V-max values (142 +/- 36 and 159 +/- 29 nmol of L-citrulline/mg min, respectively). The E298D mutation affected neither electron transfer through the reductase domain (measured as cytochrome c reduction) nor reductive O-2 activation (measured either as NADPH oxidation or as H2O2 formation in the absence of L-arginine and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4)). The mutant was activated by BH4 with an EC50 Of 0.24 +/- 0.04 muM, a value comparable to that obtained with WT eNOS (0.22 +/- 0.02 muM). Activation of the enzyme by Ca2+ was not affected (EC50 = 0.50 +/- 0.04 and 0.49 +/- 0.02 muM for WT and E298D eNOS, respectively). Calmodulin (CaM) affinity, studied by radioligand binding using I-125-labeled CaM, revealed virtually identical K-D (3.2 +/- 0.5 and 4.0 +/- 0.3 nM) and B-max (1.4 +/- 0.2 and 1.2 +/- 0.3 pmol/pmol subunit) values for WT and E298D eNOS, respectively. Furthermore, E298D eNOS did not differ from the WT enzyme with respect to heme and flavin content or the ability to form SDS-resistant dimers. To summarize, we obtained no evidence for altered enzyme function of the eNOS mutant that could explain endothelial dysfunction associated with the E298D polymorpbism.

The gene expression of A(3) receptors was examined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction experiments, whereas the amount of A. subtype on the plasma membrane was quantified by using the high-affinity and selective A(3) antagonist [H-3]5N-(4-methoxyphenyl-carbamoyl)amino-8-propyl-2-(2-furyl)pyrazolo-[4,3-e]1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine ([H-3]MRE 3008F20). Saturation experiments reveal a single high-affinity binding site with K-D values of 2.3+/-0.3, 2.6+/-0.4 nM, and B-max values of 430+/-35, 345+/-31 fmol/mg of protein for PMNs and HL60 cells, respectively. Competition of radioligand binding by adenosine ligands displays a rank order of potency typical of the A(3) subtype. EC50 values of N-6-(3-iodo-benzyl)-2-chloro-adenosine-5'-N-methyluronamide (CI-IB-MECA) for inhibition of cAMP levels via A(3) receptors are in good agreement with the binding data; furthermore, the response is potently inhibited by MRE 3008F20. In contrast, the high micromolar concentrations of Cl-IB-MECA and MRE 3008F20 in stimulating and blocking Ca2+ mobilization, respectively, are not completely consistent with the involvement of an A(3) receptor. Furthermore, an important finding of this work is that the inhibition of PMNs oxidative burst is predominantly A(2A)-mediated, even though an effect of A(3) subtype could not be excluded. This conclusion is based on potent blockade of Cl-IB-MECA-mediated inhibition of oxidative burst by SCH 58261 and a minor but significant blockade by MRE 3008F20. In conclusion, HL60 cells express A(3) receptors similar to those in PMNs, thus providing a useful model for investigation of biochemical pathways leading to A(3) receptor activation.

The peptides were evaluated in vitro and in vivo for their potential to image tumors overexpressing neurotensin receptor 1 (NTR1) by positron emission tomography (PET). All analogs exhibited in vitro binding affinity in the low nanomolar range to NTR1-expressing human tumors, measured by quantitative receptor autoradiography, HT-29 and WiDr cells, and to sections of tumors derived from these cell lines in mice. The radiotracers were internalized in the cells in vitro, and the fluorinated peptides were able to mobilize intracellular Ca2+ of WiDr cells. In in vivo studies in rats and in mice bearing HT-29 cell tumors, only a moderate uptake of the radioligands into the studied tumors was observed, presumingly due to degradation in vivo and fast elimination by the kidneys. In comparison with the other analogs, the specific tumor uptake expressed as tumor-to-muscle relation was highest for the radioligand 3. The blood clearance of 3 was reduced by co-injection of peptidase inhibitors. The catabolic pathways of the radiofluorinated peptides were elucidated. The results suggest that the high binding affinity to NTR1 and the stabilization against proteolytic degradation are not yet sufficient for tumor imaging by PET. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

However, in these studies, the calculation of the binding potential (BP, which equals receptor density divided by equilibrium dissociation constant) used a metabolite-corrected arterial input. The aim of this study was to determine whether metabolite correction and arterial sampling are essential for the assessment of BP. Methods: Five analytic methods using full datasets obtained from 6 healthy volunteers were compared. In addition, the clinical applicability of these methods was appraised. Three methods were based on Logan analysis of the dynamic PET data using metabolite-corrected and uncorrected arterial plasma input and cerebellar input. The other 2 methods consisted of a simplified reference tissue model and standard compartmental modeling. Results: A high correlation was found between BP calculated with Logan analysis using the metabolite-corrected plasma input (used as the reference method for this study) and Logan analysis using either the uncorrected arterial plasma input (r(2) = 0.95, slope = 0.85) or cerebellar input (r(2) = 0.98, slope = 0.91), A high correlation was also found between our reference method and the simplified reference tissue model (r(2) = 0.94, slope = 0.92). In contrast, a poor correlation was observed between our reference method and the standard compartmental model (r(2) = 0.45, slope = 1.59). Conclusion: These results indicate that neither metabolite analysis nor arterial sampling is necessary for clinical evaluation of BP in the human brain with [18F]MPPF. Both the Logan analysis method with cerebellar input and the simplified reference tissue method can be applied clinically.

The third binding site of melatonin, MT3, has been recently characterized as a melatonin-sensitive Term of the quinone reductase 2 (QR(2), EC 1.6.99.2). In the present work, we showed that the binding of melatonin at MT3/QR(2)was better described with 2-[I-125]-iodomethoxy-carbonylamino-N-acetyltryptamine (2-[I-125]-I-MCA-NAT) and, most importantly, that it was measurable at 20 degrees while it has been initially described and thoroughly studied using 2-[I-125]-iodomelatonin at 4 degrees. Under these novel conditions, binding to MT3 could be traced without cross-reactivity with MT1 and MT2 receptors and, moreover, under conditions similar to those used to measure MT3/QR(2) catalytic activity. The pharmacology established here on hamster kidney samples using the reference compounds remained essentially as already described using other experimental conditions. A new series of compounds with nanomolar affinity for the MT3 binding site and a high MT3 selectivity versus MT1 and MT2 is reported. In addition, we further document the MT3/QR(2) binding site by demonstrating that it was widely distributed among mammals, although inter-species and inter-tissues differences exist. The present report details new experimental conditions for the pharmacological study of melatonin-sensitive QR(2) isoforms, and suggests that, in addition to an already demonstrated inter-species difference, inter-tissues differences in QR(2) sensitivity to melatonin may exist in primates and, therefore, represent an original and interesting route of investigation on the effect of melatonin on MT3/QR(2).

However, there is a very limited direct information regarding the changes effected by such treatments in the human brain, as well as its relationship to clinical improvement. Using positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, the authors examined the cortical 5-Hydroxytryptamine-2A (5-HT2A) receptor binding of [F-18]fluoro-ethyl-spiperone after a 4-week treatment with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor paroxetine. [F-18]fluoro-ethyl-spiperone labels 5-HT2A receptors in the cortex and dopamine D-2 receptors in the basal ganglia. A binding index (BI) was calculated in the frontal cortex and the basal ganglia (mostly caudate-putamen) by reference to cerebellum. Thirty-seven inpatients with major depression with a mean +/- SD score on the 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-21) of 26.3 +/- 4.3 at admission were treated with paroxetine 40 mg/day. After 4 weeks of treatment, the BI in the frontal cortex of remitted patients (HAM-D-21 score = 4.7 +/- 4.0; N = 20) was significantly greater than the score in nonresponder patients (HAM-D-21 score = 21.2 +/- 4.0; N = 17) (BI = 0.54 +/- 0.15 and 0.41 +/- 0.17, respectively; p < 0.02). No such difference was observed in the basal ganglia (5.45 <plus/minus> 1.11 and 5.39 +/- 0.82, respectively; p = 0.85). The significant difference in cortical BI persisted when age was used as covariate (p < 0.016). These data suggest that clinical improvement in patients treated with paroxetine is associated with an increase in the density of 5-HT2A receptors in the frontal cortex.

This study explored CEND-1's pharmacokinetic (PK) properties pre-clinically and clinically, and assessed CEND-1 distribution, tumour selectivity and duration of action in pre-clinical tumour models. Its PK properties were assessed after intravenous infusion of CEND-1 at various doses in animals (mice, rats, dogs and monkeys) and patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. To assess tissue disposition, [H-3]-CEND-1 radioligand was administered intravenously to mice bearing orthotopic 4T1 mammary carcinoma, followed by tissue measurement using quantitative whole-body autoradiography or quantitative radioactivity analysis. The duration of the tumour-penetrating effect of CEND-1 was evaluated by assessing tumour accumulation of Evans blue and gadolinium-based contrast agents in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mouse models. The plasma half-life was approximately 25 min in mice and 2 h in patients following intravenous administration of CEND-1. [H-3]-CEND-1 localised to the tumour and several healthy tissues shortly after administration but was cleared from most healthy tissues by 3 h. Despite the rapid systemic clearance, tumours retained significant [H-3]-CEND-1 several hours post-administration. In mice with HCC, the tumour penetration activity remained elevated for at least 24 h after the injection of a single dose of CEND-1. These results indicate a favourable in vivo PK profile of CEND-1 and a specific and sustained tumour homing and tumour penetrability. Taken together, these data suggest that even single injections of CEND-1 may elicit long-lasting tumour PK improvements for co-administered anti-cancer agents.

Its cytotoxic profile, combined with its affinity for tumor cells when used as a radioligand for labeling these cells, suggests its potential use as antitumor therapy. In this study, glioblastoma cell lines C6 (from rat) and U373 (from human) were exposed to increased concentrations of thallium(I) acetate (5, 10, 50, 100, or 200 mu M) and several toxic endpoints were evaluated, including loss of confluence and morphological changes, loss of cell viability, changes in cell cycle, and apoptosis. Tl+ was detected in cells exposed to thallium(I) acetate, demonstrating efficient uptake mechanism. Confluence in both cell lines decreased in a concentration-dependent manner (50-200 mu M), while morphological changes (cell shrinkage and decreased cell volume) were more evident at exposures to higher Tl+ concentrations. For both parameters, the effects of Tl+ were more prominent in C6 cells compared to U373 cells. The same trend was observed for cell viability, with Tl+ affecting this parameter in C6 cells at low concentrations, whereas U373 cells showed greater resistance, with significant changes observed only at the higher concentrations. C6 and U373 cells treated with Tl+ also showed morphological characteristics corresponding to apoptosis. The cytotoxic effects of Tl+ were also assessed in neural and astrocytic primary cultures from the whole rat brain. Primary neural and astrocytic cultures were less sensitive than C6 and U373 cells, showing changes in cell viability at 50 and 100 mu M concentrations, respectively. Cell cycle in both brain tumor cell lines was altered by Tl+ in G1/G2 and S phases. In addition, when combined with temozolamide (500 mu M), Tl+ elicited cell cycle alterations, increasing SubG1 population. Combined, our novel results characterize and validate the cytotoxic and antiproliferative effects of Tl+ in glioblastoma cells.

Synthesis, radiolabeling, and pre-clinical evaluation of [<SUP>44</SUP>Sc]Sc-AAZTA conjugate PSMA inhibitor, a new tracer for high-efficiency imaging of prostate cancer	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						Scandium-44; AAZTA; Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted radioligand; PET/MRI	PET; DOTA; CHELATORS; SC-44	Purpose The aim of this work was to demonstrate the suitability of AAZTA conjugated to PSMA inhibitor (B28110) labeled with scandium-44 as a new PET tracer for diagnostic imaging of prostate cancer. Background Nowadays, scandium-44 has received significant attention as a potential radionuclide with favorable characteristics for PET applications. A polyaminopolycarboxylate heptadentate ligand based on a 1,4-diazepine scaffold (AAZTA) has been thoroughly studied as chelator for Gd3+ ions for MRI applications. The excellent results of the equilibrium, kinetic, and labeling studies led to a preliminary assessment of the in vitro and in vivo behavior of [Sc-44][Sc-(AAZTA)](-) and two derivatives, i.e., [Sc-44][Sc (CNAAZTA-BSA)] and [Sc-44][Sc (CNAAZTA-cRGDfK)]. Results B28110 was synthesized by hybrid approach, combining solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) and solution chemistry to obtain high purity (97%) product with an overall yield of 9%. Subsequently, the radioactive labeling was performed with scandium-44 produced from natural calcium target in cyclotron, in good radiochemical yields (RCY) under mild condition (pH 4, 298 K). Stability study in human plasma showed good RCP% of [Sc-44]Sc-B28110 up to 24 h (94.32%). In vivo PET/MRI imaging on LNCaP tumor-bearing mice showed high tracer accumulation in the tumor regions as early as 20 min post-injection. Ex vivo biodistribution studies confirmed that the accumulation of Sc-44-PSMA-617 was two-fold lower than that of the radiolabeled B28110 probes. Conclusions This work demonstrated the suitability of B28110 for the complexation with scandium-44 at room temperature and the high performance of the resulting new tracer based on AAZTA chelator for the diagnosis of prostate cancer using PET.

However, radiosynthesis and extensive study of radiometabolites are rarely investigated and very challenging for complex drugs. Therefore, an original radio-biomimetic (RBM) approach was developed to rapidly synthesize radiometabolites and non-invasively investigate their kinetics with PET imaging. This method enabled the challenging radiosynthesis of [C-11]nor-buprenorphine ([C-11]nor-BUP), the main metabolite of buprenorphine (BUP) which has been identified as a substrate of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transport function at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Biomimetic conditions using cytochromes P450 3A4 to convert BUP into nor-BUP were optimized taking into account the short half-life of carbon-11 (t(1/2) = 20.4 min). Those conditions afforded 32% of conversion within 20 min and were applied to the biomimetic radiosynthesis of [C-11]nor-BUP from [C-11]BUP. Automated radiosynthesis of [C-11]BUP according to a procedure described in the literature followed by optimized RBM conditions afforded [C-11]nor-BUP in 1.5% decay-corrected radiochemical yield within 90 min and 90 +/- 15 GBq/mu mol molar activity. HPLC quality control showed chemical and radiochemical purities above 98%. To demonstrate the applicability of the RBM approach to preclinical studies, brain PET images in rats showed a drastic lower uptake of [C-11]nor-BUP (0.067 +/- 0.023%ID/cm(-3)) compared to [C-11]BUP (0.436 +/- 0.054%ID/cm(-3)). P-gp inhibition using Tariquidar increased the brain uptake of [C-11]nor-BUP (0.557 +/- 0.077%ID/cm(-3)). (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Despite large research efforts, ketamine's mechanism of action in major depressive disorder (MDD) has still not been determined. In rodents, the antidepressant properties of ketamine were found to be dependent on both the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) and the serotonin (5-HT)(1B) receptor. Low 5-HT1B receptor binding in limbic brain regions is a replicated finding in MDD. In non-human primates, AMPA-dependent increase in 5-HT1B receptor binding in the ventral striatum (VST) has been demonstrated after ketamine infusion. Thirty selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-resistant MDD patients were recruited via advertisement and randomized to double-blind monotherapy with 0.5 mg/kg ketamine or placebo infusion. The patients were examined with the 5-HT1B receptor selective radioligand [C-11]AZ10419369 and positron emission tomography (PET) before and 24-72 h after treatment. 5-HT1B receptor binding did not significantly alter in patients treated with ketamine compared with placebo. An increase in 5-HT1B receptor binding with 16.7 % (p = 0.036) was found in the hippocampus after one ketamine treatment. 5-HT1B receptor binding in VST at baseline correlated with MDD symptom ratings (r = -0.426, p = 0.019) and with reduction of depressive symptoms with ketamine (r = -0.644, p = 0.002). In conclusion, reduction of depressive symptoms in MDD patients after ketamine treatment is correlated inversely with baseline 5-HT1B receptor binding in VST. Further studies examining the role of 5-HT1B receptors in the antidepressant mechanism of action of ketamine should be conducted, homing in on the 5-HT1B receptor as an MDD treatment response marker.

Recovery sleep following prolonged wakefulness restores efficient functioning of the brain, possibly by keeping glutamatergic signaling in a homeostatic range. Evidence in humans and mice suggested that metabotropic glutamate receptors of subtype-5 (mGluR5) contribute to the brain's coping mechanisms with sleep deprivation. Here, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in 31 healthy men was used to quantify the levels of glutamate (Glu), glutamate-to-glutamine ratio (GLX), and gamma-amino-butyric-acid (GABA) in basal ganglia (BG) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex on 3 consecutive days, after similar to 8 (baseline), similar to 32 (sleep deprivation), and similar to 8 hours (recovery sleep) of wakefulness. Simultaneously, mGluR5 availability was quantified with the novel radioligand for positron emission tomography, [18F]PSS232, and the blood levels of the mGluR5-regulated proteins, fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were determined. The data revealed that GLX (p = 0.03) in BG (for Glu: p < 0.06) and the serum concentration of FMRP (p < 0.04) were increased after sleep loss. Other brain metabolites (GABA, N-acetyl-aspartate, choline, glutathione) and serum BDNF levels were not altered by sleep deprivation (p(all) > 0.6). By contrast, the night without sleep enhanced whole-brain, BG, and parietal cortex mGluR5 availability, which was normalized by recovery sleep (p(all) < 0.05). The findings provide convergent multimodal evidence that glutamatergic signaling is affected by sleep deprivation and recovery sleep. They support a role for mGluR5 and FMRP in sleep-wake regulation and warrant further studies to investigate their causality and relevance for regulating human sleep in health and disease.

FAP is overexpressed by cancer-associated fibroblasts of several tumor entities. Here, we quantify the tumor uptake on Ga-68-FAPI PET/CT of various primary and metastatic tumors to identify the most promising indications for future application. Methods: Ga-68-FAPI PET/CT scans were requested by various referring physicians according to individual clinical indications that were considered insufficiently covered by F-18-FDG PET/CT or other imaging modalities. All PET/CT was performed 1 h after injection of 122-312 MBq of Ga-68-FAPI-04. We retrospectively identified 80 patients with histopathologically proven primary tumors or metastases or radiologically unequivocal metastatic lesions of histologically proven primary tumors. Tumor uptake was quantified by SUVmax and SUVmean (60% isocontour). Results: Eighty patients with 28 different tumor entities (54 primary tumors and 229 metastases) were evaluated. The highest average SUVmax (>12) was found in sarcoma, esophageal, breast, cholangiocarcinoma, and lung cancer. The lowest Ga-68-FAPI uptake (average SUVmax, 6) was observed in pheochromocytoma, renal cell, differentiated thyroid, adenoid cystic, and gastric cancer. The average SUVmax of hepatocellular, colorectal, head-neck, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancer was intermediate (SUV 6-12). SUV varied across and within all tumor entities. Because of low background in muscle and blood pool (SUVmax, 2), the tumor-to-background contrast ratios were more than 3-fold in the intermediate and more than 6-fold in the high-intensity uptake group. Conclusion: Several highly prevalent cancers presented with remarkably high uptake and image contrast on Ga-68-FAPI PET/CT. The high and rather selective tumor uptake may open up new applications for noninvasive tumor characterization, staging examinations, or radioligand therapy.

Moreover, ketamine, a global NMDAR antagonist is a potent, novel, and atypical drug that has been successfully used to treat major depressive disorder (MDD). However, because ketamine evokes unwanted side effects, alternative strategies have been developed for the treatment of depression. The objective of the present study was to determine the antidepressant effects of either a single dose of hyperforin or lanicemine vs. their combined effects in mice. Hyperforin modulates intracellular Ca2+ levels by activating Ca2+-conducting non-selective canonical transient receptor potential 6 channel (TRPC6) channels. Lanicemine, on the other hand, blocks NMDARs and regulates Ca2+ dependent processes. To evaluate the antidepressant-like activity of hyperforin and lanicemine, a set of in vivo (behavioral) and in vitro methods (western blotting, Ca2+ imaging studies, electrophysiological, and radioligand binding assays) was employed. Combined administration of hyperforin and lanicemine evoked long-lasting antidepressant-like effects in both naive and chronic corticosterone-treated mice while also enhancing the expression of the synapsin I, GluA1 subunit, and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) proteins in the frontal cortex. In Ca2+ imaging studies, lanicemine enhanced Ca2+ influx induced by hyperforin. Moreover, compound such as MK-2206 (Akt kinase inhibitor) inhibited the antidepressant-like activity of hyperforin in the tail suspension test (TST). Hyperforin reversed disturbances induced by MK-801 in the novel object recognition (NOR) test and had no effects on NMDA currents and binding to NMDAR. Our results suggest that co-administration of hyperforin and lanicemine induces long-lasting antidepressant effects in mice and that both substances may have different molecular targets.

Using [<SUP>11</SUP>C]Ro15 4513 PET to characterise GABA-benzodiazepine receptors in opiate addiction: Similarities and differences with alcoholism	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC-ACID; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; MOUSE-BRAIN; MORPHINE; BINDING; DEPENDENCE; EXPRESSION; DOPAMINE; SUBTYPE	The importance of the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex and its subtypes are increasingly recognised in addiction. Using the alpha 1/alpha 5 benzodiazepine receptor PET radioligand [C-11]Ro15 4513, we previously showed reduced binding in the nucleus accumbens and hippocampus in abstinent alcohol dependence. We proposed that reduced [C-11]Ro15 4513 binding in the nucleus accumbens was a marker of addiction whilst the reduction in hippocampus and positive relationship with memory was a consequence of chronic alcohol abuse. To examine this further we assessed [C-11]Ro15 4513 binding in another addiction, opiate dependence, and used spectral analysis to estimate contributions of alpha 1 and alpha 5 subtypes to [C-11]Ro15 4513 binding in opiate and previously acquired alcohol-dependent groups. Opiate substitute maintained opiate-dependent men (n=12) underwent an [C-11]Ro15 4513 PET scan and compared with matched healthy controls (n = 13). We found a significant reduction in [C-11]Ro15 4513 binding in the nucleus accumbens in the opiate-dependent compared with the healthy control group. There was no relationship between [C-11]Ro15 4513 binding in the hippocampus with memory. We found that reduced [C-11]Ro15 4513 binding was associated with reduced alpha 5 but not alpha 1 subtypes in the opiate-dependent group. This was also seen in an alcohol-dependent group where an association between memory performance and [C-11]Ro15 4513 binding was primarily driven by alpha 5 and not alpha 1 subtype. We suggest that reduced alpha 5 levels in the nucleus accumbens are associated with addiction since we have now show n this in dependence to two pharmacologically different substances, alcohol and opiates.

PET Reveals Inflammation around Calcified <i>Taenia solium</i> Granulomas with Perilesional Edema	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN; 18 KDA; NEUROCYSTICERCOSIS; METHOTREXATE; RADIOLIGAND; EXPRESSION; MONKEY	Objective: Neurocysticercosis, an infection with the larval form of the tapeworm, Taenia solium, is the cause of 29% of epilepsy in endemic regions. Epilepsy in this population is mostly associated with calcified granulomas; at the time of seizure recurrence 50% of those with calcifications demonstrate transient surrounding perilesional edema. Whether edema is consequence of the seizure, or a result of host inflammation directed against parasite antigens or other processes is unknown. To investigate whether perilesional edema is due to inflammation, we imaged a marker of neuroinflammation, translocater protein (TSPO), using positron emission tomography (PET) and the selective ligand C-11-PBR28. Methods: In nine patients with perilesional edema, degenerating cyst or both, PET findings were compared to the corresponding magnetic resonance images. Degenerating cysts were also studied because unlike perilesional edema, degenerating cysts are known to have inflammation. In three of the nine patients, changes in C-11-PBR28 binding were also studied over time. C-11-PBR28 binding was compared to the contralateral un-affected region. Results: C-11-PBR28 binding increased by a mean of 13% in perilesional edema or degenerating cysts (P = 0.0005, n = 13 in nine patients). Among these 13 lesions, perilesional edema (n = 10) showed a slightly smaller increase of 10% compared to the contralateral side (P = 0.005) than the three degenerating cysts. In five lesions with perilesional edema in which repeated measurements of C-11-PBR28 binding were done, increased binding lasted for 2-9 months. Conclusions: Increased TSPO in perilesional edema indicates an inflammatory etiology. The long duration of increased TSPO binding after resolution of the original perilesional edema and the pattern of periodic episodes is consistent with intermittent exacerbation from a continued baseline presence of low level inflammation. Novel anti-inflammatory measures may be useful in the prevention or treatment of seizures in this population.

Blockade of the brain histamine H3 receptor by JNJ-39220675: preclinical PET studies with [<SUP>11</SUP>C]GSK189254 in anesthetized baboon	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Histamine H-3; PET; JNJ-39220675	H-3 RECEPTOR; DOPAMINE TRANSPORTERS; ANTAGONISTS; DISORDERS; TARGET; IDENTIFICATION; RADIOLIGAND; AGONIST	The preclinical characterization of a series of aryloxypyridine amides has identified JNJ-39220675 ((4-cyclobutyl-1,4-diazepan-1-yl)(6-(4-fluorophenoxy)pyridin-3-yl)methanone) as a high-affinity histamine H-3 receptor antagonist and a candidate for further drug development particularly in the treatment of alcohol-related behaviors. This study measured brain histamine H-3 receptor blockade by JNJ-39220675 (1 mg/kg) in the female baboon. Positron emission tomography imaging and [C-11]GSK189254, a reversible high-affinity radiotracer with specificity for the histamine H-3 receptor, was used to measure histamine H-3 receptor availability at baseline and after i.v. and oral administration of JNJ-39220675 (1 mg/kg) in the anesthetized baboon. Histamine H-3 receptor availability was estimated as the total distribution volume (V (T)) in brain regions. The sensitivity of [C-11]GSK189254 binding to injected mass and carryover effects was determined. JNJ-39220675 produces robust (ca. 90 %) blockade of [C-11]GSK189254 binding after i.v. and oral administration. After oral administration of JNJ-39220675 (1 mg/kg), the fractional receptor occupancy was > 0.9 at 90 min with a slight increase from 90 to 240 min. Similar to prior studies in humans, V (T) was highly sensitive to the mass of GSK189254 with ED50 estimated to be 0.16 mu g/kg. The robust blockade of binding of [C-11]GSK189254 by JNJ-39220675 demonstrates that this compound readily penetrates the blood-brain barrier and occupies the histamine H-3 receptor after oral administration at low plasma concentrations (similar to 1 ng/cc) supporting further drug development for alcohol addiction and other disorders. This study corroborates prior reports of the high sensitivity of [C-11]GSK189254 to injected mass at doses > 0.1 mu g/kg.

Chronic treatment <i>in vivo</i> with β-adrenoceptor agonists induces dysfunction of airway β<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptors and exacerbates lung inflammation in mice	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						beta-adrenoceptor; beta-agonist; receptor desensitization; airway remodelling; airway inflammation; asthma; loss of bronchoprotection; mouse	REGULAR INHALED SALBUTAMOL; TWICE-DAILY TREATMENT; SMOOTH-MUSCLE; MURINE MODEL; BRONCHODILATOR SUBSENSITIVITY; ASTHMATIC-PATIENTS; RECEPTOR KINASE; DOWN-REGULATION; HEART-FAILURE; MILD ASTHMA	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Inhalation of a beta-adrenoceptor agonist (beta-agonist) is first-line asthma therapy, used for both prophylaxis against, and acute relief of, bronchoconstriction. However, repeated clinical use of beta-agonists leads to impaired bronchoprotection and, in some cases, adverse patient outcomes. Mechanisms underlying this beta(2)-adrenoceptor dysfunction are not well understood, due largely to the lack of a comprehensive animal model and the uncertainty as to whether or not bronchorelaxation in mice is mediated by beta(2)-adrenoceptors. Thus, we aimed to develop a mouse model that demonstrated functional beta-agonist-induced beta(2)-adrenoceptor desensitization in the context of allergic inflammatory airway disease. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH We combined chronic allergen exposure with repeated beta-agonist inhalation in allergen-treated BALB/C mice and examined the contribution of beta(2)-adrenoceptors to albuterol-induced bronchoprotection using FVB/NJ mice with genetic deletion of beta(2)-adrenoceptors (KO). Associated inflammatory changes-cytokines (ELISA), cells in bronchoalevolar lavage and airway remodelling (histology) and beta(2)-adrenoceptor density (radioligand binding) -were also measured. KEY RESULTS beta(2)-Adrenoceptors mediated albuterol-induced bronchoprotection in mice. Chronic treatment with albuterol induced loss of bronchoprotection, associated with exacerbation of the inflammatory components of the asthma phenotype. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS This animal model reproduced salient features of human asthma and linked loss of bronchoprotection with airway pathobiology. Accordingly, the model offers an advanced tool for understanding the mechanisms of the effects of chronic bagonist treatment on beta-adrenoceptor function in asthma. Such information may guide the clinical use of beta-agonists and provide insight into development of novel beta-adrenoceptor ligands for the treatment of asthma.

PRECLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OF TP1, A NOVEL POTENT TRIPLE REUPTAKE INHIBITOR WITH ANTIDEPRESSANT PROPERTIES	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						TP1; depression; triple reuptake inhibitors; bioavailability	IN-VIVO; SEROTONIN; NOREPINEPHRINE; DEPRESSION; DOPAMINE; MODEL	Triple reuptake inhibitors (TRIs) that block the dopamine transporter (DAT), norepinephrine transporter (NET), and serotonin transporter (SERT) are being developed as a new class of antidepressant that may have better efficacy and fewer side effects compared with traditional antidepressants. The purpose of this study was to characterize a new chemical entity, 4-[2-(dimethylamino)-1-(1-hydroxycyclohexyl)ethyl] phenyl 4-methoxybenzoate hydrochloride (TP1). TP1 was designed as a prodrug of desvenlafaxine. Competitive radioligand binding assays were performed using cells expressing the human dopamine (DA) transporter (hDAT), the human serotonin (5-HT) transporter (hSERT), and the human norepinephrine (NE) transporter (hNET) with K(i) values for TP1 of 190 nM, 2076 nM, and 1023 nM, respectively. Uptake assays were performed with IC(50) values for TP1 of 712 nM, 521 nM, and 628 nM, respectively. TP1 (0.06 mmol/kg, orally) rapidly penetrated rat brain and hypothalamus, translated into desvenlafaxine within 1 h, and demonstrated higher bioavailability and better pharmacokinetic properties than desvenlafaxine succinate (DVS). TP1 (0.06 mmol/kg, orally) significantly increased extracellular levels of DA, NE, and 5-HT compared with baseline in the rat hypothalamus by microdialysis assay. In dose-response assays, oral administration of TP1 reduced the time of immobility in a dose-dependent manner during tail suspension test and forced swimming test (FST). This antidepressant-like effect manifests in the absence of significant increases in motor activity even at doses of up to 32 mg/kg. The ability of TP1 to inhibit the reuptake of three biogenic amines closely linked to the etiology of depression may result in a therapeutic profile different from antidepressants that inhibit the reuptake of serotonin and/or NE.

Analysis of the H4R in these diseases depends on the use of animal models. However, there are substantial pharmacological differences between various H4R species orthologs. The purpose of this study was to analyze the pharmacological properties of canine, rat, and murine H4R in comparison to human H4R expressed in Sf9 insect cells. Only hH(4)R and cH(4)R exhibited a sufficiently high [H-3] histamine affinity for radioligand binding studies. Generally, cH(4)R exhibited lower ligand-affinities than hH(4)R. Similarly, in high-affinity GTPase studies, ligands were more potent at hH(4)R than at other H4R species orthologs. Unlike the other H4R species orthologs, hH(4)R exhibited high agonist-independent (constitutive) activity. Most strikingly, the prototypical H4R antagonist (1-[(5-chloro-1H-indol-2-yl) carbonyl]-4-methylpiperazine) (JNJ7777120) exhibited partial agonistic activity at cH(4)R, rH(4)R, and mH(4)R, whereas at hH(4)R, JNJ7777120 was a partial inverse agonist. H4R agonists from the class of N-G-acylated imidazolylpropylguanidines and cyanoguanidines exhibited substantial differences in terms of affinity, potency, and efficacy among H4R species orthologs, too. The species-dependent pharmacological profiles are not due to the highly variable amino acid sequence position 341. Finally, H4R species orthologs differ from each other in terms of regulation by NaCl. Collectively, there are profound pharmacological differences between H4R species orthologs. Most importantly, caution must be exerted when interpreting pharmacological effects of "the prototypical H4R antagonist" JNJ7777120 as H4R antagonism.

However, the exact anatomical location of delta-opioid receptors (DORs) and expression during maturation of the autonomic and sensory innervations of the neonatal heart is unknown. Therefore, we aimed to characterize target sites for opioids in neonatal rat heart intracardiac ganglia at postnatal day (P)1, P7 and adulthood (P56-P84). Rat heart atria were subjected to reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, radioligand binding, and immunofluorescence confocal analysis of DORs with the neuronal markers vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and substance P (SP). Our results demonstrated DOR mRNA, protein, and binding sites that gradually increased from P1 toward adulthood. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy showed DOR co-localized with VAChT in large-diameter principal neurons, TH-immunoreactive (IR) small intensely fluorescent (SIF) catecholaminergic cells, and CGRP-or SP-IR afferent nerve terminals arborizing within intracardiac ganglia and atrial myocardium. Co-expression of DOR with VAChT-IR neurons was observed from the first day of birth (P1). In contrast, DORs on TH-IR SIF cells or CGRP-IR fibers were not observed in intracardiac ganglia of P1, but rather in P7 rats. The density of nerve fibers in atrial myocardium co-expressing DORs with different neuronal markers increased from neonatal age toward adulthood. In summary, the enhanced DOR expression parallel to the maturation of cardiac parasympathetic, sympathetic, and sensory innervation of the heart suggests that the cardiac opioid system is an important regulator of neonatal and adult heart function through the autonomic nervous system.

In order to establish whether these changes in the cholinergic system occur at an early stage of AD, we carried out positron emission tomography (PET) with a specific radioligand for the alpha 4 beta 2* nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha 4 beta 2* nAChR) in patients with mild to moderate AD and in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), who have a high risk to progress to AD. Nine patients with moderate AD, eight patients with MCI and seven age-matched healthy controls underwent 2-[(18)F]fluoro-3-(2(S)-azetidinylmethoxy)pyridine (2-[(18)F]FA-85380) PET. After coregistration with individual magnetic resonance imaging the binding potential (BP(ND)) of 2-[(18)F]FA-85380 was calculated using either the corpus callosum or the cerebellum as reference regions. PET data were analysed by region of interest analysis and by voxel-based analysis. Both patients with AD and MCI showed a significant reduction in 2-[(18)F]FA-85380 BP(ND) in typical AD-affected brain regions. Thereby, the corpus callosum was identified as the most suitable reference region. The 2-[(18)F]FA-85380 BP(ND) correlated with the severity of cognitive impairment. Only MCI patients that converted to AD in the later course (n = 5) had a reduction in 2-[(18)F]FA-85380 BP(ND). 2-[(18)F]FA-85380 PET appears to be a sensitive and feasible tool for the detection of a reduction in alpha 4 beta 2* nAChRs which seems to be an early event in AD. In addition, 2-[(18)F]FA-85380 PET might give prognostic information about a conversion from MCI to AD.

Herein, we further characterize these receptor states using series of saturation radioligand binding studies and their differential displacement binding by various CB1 receptor ligands. Binding experiments were carried out in naive rat/dog whole brain membranes using radioligands [(3)H] CP55,940 (for R* state) & [(3)H]SR141716A (both R* and R states) and various agonist, antagonist & inverse agonist ligands at CB1 receptors. In the saturation binding experiments, of the total number of CB1 receptor binding sites (R* + R) in the rat and dog whole brain membranes, only about 183 and 11.6% were in the active (R*) state recognized by [(3)H]CP55,940, respectively. In the competitive binding studies, all the CB1 receptor agonists investigated had significantly very high affinity for the active R. state recognized by [(3)H] CP55,940 and lower affinity for the inactive R state mainly recognized by [(3)H]SR141716A in the presence of a non-hydrolyzable analogue of GTP [Gpp(NH)p]. In contrast, various CB1 receptor antagonists/inverse agonists had similar nanomolar affinities at both [(3)H]CP55,940 and [(3)H]SR141716A recognized binding states. These results clearly characterize the significant differences between the active R* and inactive R binding states of CB1 receptors in naive rat and dog brain. In addition, these results also demonstrates that the CB1 agonists and antagonists/inverse agonists can be differentiated by their relative affinities at active (R*) and inactive (R) binding states of the CB1 receptor.

Inhibitory mechanisms and binding site location for serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY & CELL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors; Serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors; Conformational states; Ca2+ influx; Radioligand binding; Molecular modeling	DIFFERENT CONFORMATIONAL STATES; MOLECULAR-MECHANISMS; TRICYCLIC ANTIDEPRESSANTS; QUINACRINE BINDING; ION-CHANNEL; FLUOXETINE; DYNAMICS; MUSCLE; DIZOCILPINE; ANTAGONISTS	Functional and structural approaches were used to examine the inhibitory mechanisms and binding site location for fluoxetine and paroxetine, two serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors, on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) in different conformational states. The results establish that: (a) fluoxetine and paroxetine inhibit h alpha 1 beta 1 gamma delta AChR-induced Ca2+ influx with higher potencies than dizocilpine. The potency of fluoxetine is increased similar to 10-fold after longer pre-incubation periods, which is in agreement with the enhancement of [H-3]cytisine binding to resting but activatable Torpedo AChRs elicited by these antidepressants, (b) fluoxetine and paroxetine inhibit the binding of the phencyclidine analog piperidyl-3,4(-3)H(N)]-(N-(1-(2 thienyl)cyclohexyl)-3,4-piperidine to the desensitized Torpedo AChR with higher affinities compared to the resting AChR, and (c) fluoxetine inhibits [H-3]dizocilpine binding to the desensitized AChR, suggesting a mutually exclusive interaction. This is supported by our molecular docking results where neutral dizocilpine and fluoxetine and the conformer of protonated fluoxetine with the highest LUDI score interact with the domain between the valine (position 13') and leucine (position 9') rings. Molecular mechanics calculations also evidence electrostatic interactions of protonated fluoxetine at positions 20', 21', and 24'. Protonated dizocilpine bridges these two binding domains by interacting with the valine and outer ( position 20') rings. The high proportion of protonated fluoxetine and dizocilpine calculated at physiological pH suggests that the protonated drugs can be attracted to the channel mouth before binding deeper within the AChR ion channel between the leucine and valine rings, a domain shared with phencyclidine, finally blocking ion flux and inducing AChR desensitization.

The endogenous cannabinoid anandamide inhibits cromakalim-activated K<SUP>+</SUP> currents in follicle-enclosed <i>Xenopus</i> Oocytes	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							RECEPTOR-MEDIATED RESPONSES; GLYCINE RECEPTORS; DELAYED RECTIFIER; CYTOSOLIC CA2+; ATP CHANNELS; ION CHANNELS; CELLS; NEURONS; MATURATION; LIPIDS	The effect of the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide on K+ currents activated by the ATP-sensitive potassium (K-ATP) channel opener cromakalim was investigated in follicle-enclosed Xenopus oocytes using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. Anandamide (1 - 90 mu M) reversibly inhibited cromakaliminduced K+ currents, with an IC50 value of 8.1 +/- 2 mu M. Inhibition was noncompetitive and independent of membrane potential. Coapplication of anandamide with the cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor antagonist N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4chlorophenyl)- 1-(2,4- dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3carboximide hydrochloride (SR 141716A) (1 mu M), the CB2 receptor antagonist N-[(1S) endo-1,3,3-trimethyl bicyclo heptan2- yl]-5-(4-chloro-3-methylphenyl)-1-(4-methylbenzyl)-pyrazole-3carboxamide (SR144528) (1 mu M), or pertussis toxin (5 mu g/ml) did not alter the inhibitory effect of anandamide, suggesting that known cannabinoid receptors are not involved in anandamide inhibition of K+ currents. Similarly, neither the amidohydrolase inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ( 0.2 mM) nor the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin ( 5 mu M) affected anandamide inhibition of K+ currents, suggesting that the effects of anandamide are not mediated by its metabolic products. In radioligand binding studies, anandamide inhibited the specific binding of the K-ATP ligand [H-3] glibenclamide in the oocyte microsomal fractions, with an IC50 value of 6.3 +/- 0.4 mu M. Gonadotropin- induced oocyte maturation and the cromakalim- acceleration of progesterone- induced oocyte maturation were significantly inhibited in the presence of 10 mu M anandamide. Collectively, these results indicate that cromakalim- activated K+ currents in follicular cells of Xenopus oocytes are modulated by anandamide via a cannabinoid receptor- independent mechanism and that the inhibition of these channels by anandamide alters the responsiveness of oocytes to gonadotropin and progesterone.

Cholinesterase inhibitor use does not significantly influence the ability of <SUP>123</SUP>I-FP-CIT imaging to distinguish Alzheimer's disease from dementia with Lewy bodies	JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY NEUROSURGERY AND PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							STRIATAL DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER; IN-VIVO; SEROTONIN TRANSPORTERS; SPECIES-DIFFERENCES; BINDING; BRAIN; MONKEY; CIT; PET	Background: I-123- labelled 2 beta- carbomethoxy- 3 beta-( 4- iodophenyl)- N-( 3- fluoropropyl) nortropane ( I-123- FP- CIT) imaging is a diagnostic tool to help differentiate dementia with Lewy bodies ( DLB) from Alzheimer's disease ( AD). However, in animals, cholinesterase inhibitors ( ChEi) have been reported to reduce radioligand binding to the striatal dopamine transporter. As ChEi are frequently used in people with dementia, it is important to determine whether their use affects I-123- FP- CIT uptake in the striatum. Objective: To clarify whether chronic ChEi therapy modulates striatal dopamine transporter binding measured by I-123- FP- CIT in patients with AD, DLB and Parkinson's disease with dementia ( PDD). Design: Cross sectional study in 99 patients with AD ( nine on ChEi, 25 not on ChEi), DLB ( nine on ChEi, 19 not on ChEi) and PDD ( six on ChEi, 31 not on ChEi) comparing I-123- FP- CIT striatal binding ( caudate, anterior and posterior putamen) in patients receiving compared with those not receiving ChEi, correcting for key clinical variables including diagnosis, age, sex, Mini- Mental State Examination score, severity of parkinsonism and concurrent antidepressant use. Results: As previously described, I-123- FP- CIT striatal uptake was lower in DLB and PDD subjects compared with those with AD. Median duration of ChEi use was 180 days. I-123- FP- CIT uptake was not significantly reduced in subjects receiving ChEi compared those not receiving ChEi ( mean percentage reduction: AD 4.3%; DLB 0.7%; PDD 6.1%; p = 0.40). ChEi use did not differentially affect striatal (FP)-F-123- CIT uptake between patient groups ( p = 0.83). Conclusions: Use of ChEi does not significantly influence the ability of 123I- FP- CIT imaging to distinguish AD from DLB.

WAY-100635 is a potent dopamine D<sub>4</sub> receptor agonist	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						WAY-100635; WAY-100634; 5-HT1A; D-4; D-2; receptor selectivity	5-HT1A RECEPTOR; ADENYLATE-CYCLASE; HUMAN BRAIN; ANTAGONIST; PET; SENSITIZATION; DELINEATION; NAD-299	Rationale and objectives WAY-100635 is a prototypical 5-HT1A receptor antagonist and has been used widely as a pharmacological probe to investigate the distribution and function of 5-HT1A receptors. Results from our studies suggested that WAY-100635 was potently inducing effects unrelated to its 5-HT1A receptor affinity. In the present work, we evaluated the in vitro pharmacology of this compound at two D-2-like receptor subtypes. Method The functional properties and binding affinities of WAY-100635 were evaluated in HEK 293 cells stably expressing dopamine D-2L or D-4.4 receptors. Results Initial screens performed by the NIMH Psychoactive Drug Screening Program indicated that WAY-100635 displayed 940, 370, and 16 nM binding affinities at D-2L, D-3, and D-4.2 receptors, respectively. Subsequent saturation analyses demonstrated that the K-d of [H-3]WAY-100635 at D-4.2 receptors was 2.4 nM, only tenfold higher than 5-HT1A. WAY-100635 and its major metabolite, WAY-100634, were potent agonists in HEK-D-4.4 cells (EC50=9.7 +/- 2.2 and 0.65 +/- 0.2 nM, respectively). WAY-100635 behaved as a full agonist, and WAY-100634 was a nearly full agonist. In HEK-D-2L cells, WAY-100635 weakly antagonized the effects of 300 nM quinpirole. Subsequent radioligand binding studies confirmed that WAY-100635 possesses high affinity for D-4.4 receptors but binds weakly to D-2L receptors (3.3 +/- 0.6 and 420 +/- 11 nM, respectively). Conclusions This study demonstrates that WAY-100635 is not a "selective" 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, as previously reported, and conclusions drawn from studies that employed WAY-100635 as a selective 5-HT1A antagonist may need to be reevaluated.

Iodinated analogues of SA4503 (4a-c) were prepared from piperazine in a high yield. The in vitro competition binding studies using [H-3]DTG (sigma-1, 2), [H-3] (+)-pentazocine (sigma-1), and [H-3]DTG in the presence of carbetapentane (sigma-2) as sigma receptor selective radioligands were revealed that iodinated analogues 4a-c possess high affinities to sigma receptors (IC50: 4a=7.1, 4b=31.0, and 4c=77.3nm). In particular, the affinity of 4a, bearing iodine at ortho position on the phenyl ring, was 4.4 times greater than SA4503, and 3 times greater than that of haloperidol. The meta-iodo analogue 4b was the same to SA4503, the lead compound. The radioiodinated derivatives, [I-125] 4a, 4b were synthesized no-carrier-added from the corresponding tributyltin precursors by the iododestannylation reaction with high yields. The binding of [I-125] 4a, 4b have been characterized in the rat brain membranes. These compounds were indicated single population binding to sigma receptor with high affinity (4a: K-d=1.86 +/- 0.34nm, B-max=205 +/- 28.9 fmol/mg protein, 4b: K-d=3.30 +/- 0.51 nM, B-max=231.5 +/- 13.8 fmol/mg protein). In vitro blocking studies were confirmed that the high specificity of 4a, 4b. These results suggest that radioiodinated 4a and 4b are promising sigma receptors imaging ligand for pursuing further in vivo studies.

In the present study, [H-3]L-655,708 was used to label mouse brain benzodiazepine binding sites in vivo. When compared to inhibition of in vivo binding of the non-selective ligand [H-3]Ro 15-1788, the pharmacology of mouse in vivo [H-3]L-655,708 binding was consistent with selective in vivo labelling of a5 subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors. Thus, diazepam was equipotent at inhibiting in vivo [H-3]L-655,708 and [H-3]Ro 15-1788 binding; zolpidem, which has very low affinity for alpha 5-containing GABA(A) receptors, gave no inhibition of in vivo [H-3]L-655,708 binding despite inhibiting in vivo [H-3]Ro 15-1788 binding; and L-655,708 was more potent at inhibiting the in vivo binding of [H-3]L-655,708 compared to [H-3]Ro 15-1788. This pharmacological specificity of in Vivo [H-3]L-655,708 binding was confirmed autoradiographically. Hence, the anatomical distribution of in vivo [H-3]L-655,708 binding was comparable to the distribution of alpha 5-containing GABA(A) receptors identified in vitro. Moreover, this distribution was distinct from that identified using [H-3]Ro 15-1788. These data therefore suggest that [H-3]L-655,708 can be used to identify a5-containing GABAA receptors in vivo and that this ligand can be used to measure receptor occupancy of alpha 5-selective ligands.

In addition to being localized on the plasma membrane, D-1A receptors are mainly present in intracellular compartments under basal conditions. We observed, using [H-3]SCH-23390 binding and immunoblotting, that dopamine recruits D-1A receptors to the plasma membrane in rat renal proximal tubules. Furthermore, radioligand binding and/or immunoblotting experiments using pharmacological modulators showed that dopamine-induced D-1A receptor recruitment requires activation of cell surface D-1-like receptors, activation of adenylyl cyclase, and intact endocytic vesicles with internal acidic pH. A key finding of this study was that these recruited D-1A receptors were functional because they potentiated dopamine-induced [S-35]GTPgammaS binding, cAMP accumulation, and Na-K-ATPase inhibition. Interestingly, dopamine increased immunoreactivity of D-1A receptors specifically in caveolin-rich plasma membranes isolated by a sucrose density gradient. In support of this observation, coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that D-1A receptors interacted with caveolin-2 in an agonist-dependent fashion. The caveolin-rich plasma membranes had a high content of the alpha(1)-subunit of Na-K-ATPase, which is a downstream target of D-1A receptor signaling in proximal tubules. These results show that dopamine, via the D1-like receptor-adenylyl cyclase pathway, recruits D-1A receptors to the plasma membrane. These newly recruited receptors couple to G proteins, increase cAMP, and participate in dopamine-mediated inhibition of Na-K-ATPase in proximal tubules. Moreover, dopamine-induced recruitment of D-1A receptors to the caveolin-rich plasma membranes brings them in close proximity to targets such as Na-K-ATPase in proximal tubules of Sprague-Dawley rats.

J	Moulik, S; Speth, RC; Turner, BB; Rowe, BP				Moulik, S; Speth, RC; Turner, BB; Rowe, BP			Angiotensin II receptor subtype distribution in the rabbit brain	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						angiotensin II receptors; rabbit brain	BINDING-SITES; LOCALIZATION; PROJECTIONS; ORGANIZATION; STEM	Previous work has reported that the distribution of AT(1) binding sites in the rabbit brain is similar to that in the rat, but AT(2) binding sites are confined to the septum and cerebellum of the rabbit brain. This receptor autoradiographic study was designed to enhance the detection of angiotensin 11 binding sites by using greater radioligand concentrations, and to survey the midbrain in more detail than in previous studies. Tissue sections from five rabbit forebrains, three midbrains, and three hindbrains were incubated with 520 pM I-125-sar(1)ile(8) angiotensin II. The results confirm abundant AT(1) binding in regions involved in cardiovascular and drinking regulation: the nucleus of the solitary tract, ventrolateral medulla, subfornical organ, organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, median eminence, and several hypothalamic structures. Novel AT(1) binding sites were discovered in the pituitary, retrorubral field, periolivary region, dorsolateral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, dorsal raphe, and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei. The distribution of AT(1) binding was similar to the distribution of monoaminergic neurons. AT(2) binding was moderately dense and well visualized in the cerebellum. In contrast to the rat, AT(2) binding was not detected in the inferior olive of the rabbit, but lobe 9 of the cerebellum exhibited a banding pattern of AT(2) binding reminiscent of the pattern of neuronal projections from the inferior olive. It is possible that AT(2) protein is observed at different stages of axonal transport between the inferior olive and the cerebellum in the two species. Our results did identify new AT(2) binding sites in the superior colliculus and cerebral cortex, but it is clear that AT(2) binding in the rabbit brain is weak and is not as widely distributed as in the rat.

Here we report the isolation and functional expression of two complementary DNAs (cDNAs), from the chum salmon Oncorhynchus keta, which encode orthologues of the mammalian and amphibian CRF type 1 (CRF) and type 2 (CRF2) receptors. Radioligand competition binding experiments have revealed that the salmon CRF1 and CRF2 receptors bind urotensin I with similar to 8-fold higher affinity than rat/human CRF. These two peptides. together with two related CRF-like peptides, namely, sauvagine and urocortin, were also tested in cAMP assays; for cells expressing the salmon CRF1 receptor, EC50 values for the stimulation of cAMP production were between 4.5 +/- 1.8 and 15.3 +/- 3.1 nM. For the salmon CRF2 receptor, the corresponding values were: rat/human CRF, 9.4 +/- 0.4 nM; urotensin I, 21.2 +/- 2.1 nM; sauvagine, 0.7 +/- 0.1 nM; and urocortin, 2.2 +/- 0.7 nM. We have also functionally coupled the O. keta CRF1 receptor, in Xenopus laevis oocytes, to the endogenous Ca2+-activated chloride conductance by co-expression with the G-protein alpha subunit, G(alpha 16). The EC50 value for channel activation by rat/human CRF (11.2 +/- 2.6 nM) agrees well with that obtained in cAMP assays (15.3 +/- 3.1 nM). We conclude that although sauvagine is 13- and 30-fold more potent than rat/human CRF and urotensin I, respectively, in activating the salmon CRF2 receptor, neither receptor appears able to discriminate between the native ligands.

A single, acute dose of TCDD can alter its own receptor levels thus complicating evaluation of dose-response relationships for AHR-mediated events. Since environmental exposure to dioxins is typically of a repeated low-dose nature, we examined the effect of such exposure on AHR expression. Three rat strains differing greatly in their sensitivity to acute TCDD lethality, Long-Evans (Turku AB) (L-E) (LD50 similar to 10 mug/kg); Sprague Dawley (SD) (LD50 similar to 50 mug/kg); and Han/Wistar (Kuopio) (H/W) (LD50 > 9600 mug/kg), were administered TCDD intragastrically, biweekly for 22 weeks producing doses equivalent to 0, 10, 30, and 100 ng/kg/day. Changes in hepatic AHR levels were quantitated at the protein level by radioligand binding and immunoblotting and at the mRNA level by RT-PCR. Cytosolic AHR protein was elevated at 10 or 30 ng/kg/day TCDD in SD and L-E rats; AHR mRNA was also elevated at these doses, suggesting a pretranslational mechanism. There was no apparent relationship between TCDD-induced AHR regulation and strain sensitivity to TCDD. Overall, "subchronic" TCDD did not greatly perturb AHR expression, The maintenance of relatively constant receptor levels in the face of persistent agonist stimulation is in contrast to the sustained depletion of AHR by TCDD observed in cell culture and to the fluctuations in AHR observed hours to days following acute TCDD exposure in vivo. Changes in AHR levels may affect dose-response relationships; the effect of TCDD on its own receptor at environmentally relevant dosing schemes is therefore important to risk assessment.

However, transcripts of the V1b VP receptor (V1bR) have been detected throughout the rat brain by RT-PCR and in situ hybridization, indicating that the V1bR adds to the population of central VP receptors. Because there are no specific ligands for the V1bR, the receptor protein itself has been difficult to visualize. In the present study, the distribution of the V1bR protein was investigated in the rat forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain, and cerebellum by immunohistochemistry using an antiserum raised against a synthetic fragment of the carboxylterminal of the rat V1bR protein. Immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of the V1bR in pituitary corticotrophs as expected. In naive, untreated rats, fiber networks containing V1bR-immunoreactivity were mainly concentrated in the hypothalamus, amygdala, cerebellum, and particularly in those areas with a leaky blood brain barrier or close to the circumventricular organs (medial habenula, subfornical organ, organum vasculosum laminae terminalis, median eminence, and nuclei lining to the third and fourth ventricles). A strikingly dense network was present in the external zone of the median eminence. Colchicine treatment was required to reveal the localization of V1bR-immunoreactive cell bodies. V1bR-containing cell bodies and associated protrusions were mainly located in the hippocampus, caudate putamen, cortex, thalamus, olfactory bulb, and cerebellum. These results demonstrate the widespread distribution of the V1bR protein in the rat brain over multiple, functionally distinct neuronal systems. These data suggest that the V1bR mediates different physiological functions of VP in the brain.

All agonist activities were antagonized by the CB1-selective antagonist SR141716A. 5 It was found that a ligand's CB1 affinity and efficacy are differentially altered by modifications in the side-chain. Decreasing the flexibility of the side-chain reduced efficacy but largely did not alter affinity. Additionally, the positioning of electrostatic moieties. such as cyano groups. within the sidechain also has contrasting effects on these two properties. 6 In summary, this report details the characterization of a number of novel Delta (8)-THC analogues in rat cerebellar membranes. It provides the first detailed pharmacological analysis of how the inclusion of electrostatic moieties in the side-chain and also how alteration of the side-chain's flexibility may differentially affect a CB1 cannabinoid receptor ligand's affinity and efficacy.

In the present study, the pharmacological profile of the beta-adrenoceptor present in Bothrops jararaca venom gland was characterized by radioligand binding assay and by the ability of isoprenaline to promote accumulation of cyclic AMP in dispersed secretory cells. In both cases, the venom glands were obtained from non-extracted snakes (quiescent stage) or from snakes which venom was extracted 4 days before sacrifice (venom production stimulated stage). [I-125]-iodocyanopindolol ([I-125]-ICYP) bound to extracted gland membranes in a concentration-dependent and saturable manner, but with low affinity, Propranolol, beta(1)- or beta(2)-selective adrenoceptors ligands displaced the [I-125]-ICYP binding with low affinity, while selective beta(3)-adrenoceptor ligands did not displace the [I-125]-ICYP binding. The displacement of [I-125]-ICYP by propranolol was similar in non-extracted and extracted glands, showing the presence of beta-adrenoceptors in both stages. In dispersed secretory cells of non-extracted glands, isoprenaline (1 mu M) increased the cyclic AMP production and propranolol (10 mu M) was able to block this effect. On the other hand, in extracted glands, isoprenaline had no effect. The results suggest that the beta-adrenoceptors present in the Bothrops jararaca venom glands are different from those (beta(1), beta(2) or beta(3)) described in mammals, but are coupled to the Gs protein, like the known beta-adrenoceptor subtypes, Moreover, previous in vivo stimulation of venom production desensitizes the beta-adrenoceptors system and, although the receptors could be detected by binding studies, they are not coupled to the Gs protein, indicating that beta-adrenoceptors stimulation contributes to the initial steps of venom synthesis.

Due to the relatively high expression of the CB2 isotype on peripheral immune cells, it has been hypothesized that this receptor mediates the immunosuppressive effects of cannabinoids. Unfortunately, there was a dearth of pharmacological studies with the endocannabinoids and human CB2 (hCB2). These studies compare and contrast the potency and efficacy of anandamide, 2-AG, and the synthetic cannabinoid HU210 at hCB2. Using [S-35]guanosine-5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) and radioligand bindings in insect Sf9-hCB2 membranes, we showed that both endocannabinoids bound hCB2 with similar affinity and that the cannabinoids acted as full agonists in stimulating [S-35]GTP gamma S exchange, although 2-AG was 3-fold more potent than anandamide (EC50 = 38.9 +/- 3.1 and 121 +/- 29 nM, respectively). In a mammalian expression system (Chinese hamster ovary-hCB2 cells), HU210 and 2-AG maximally inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP synthesis (IC50 = 1.61 +/- 0.42 nM and 1.30 +/- 0.37 mu M, respectively) although anandamide was ineffective. In Chinese hamster ovary-hCB2 membranes, HU210 and 2-AG were also full agonists in stimulating [S-35]GTP gamma S binding (EC50 = 1.96 +/- 0.35 and 122 +/- 17 nM, respectively), but anandamide was a weak partial agonist (EC50 = 261 +/- 91 nM; 34 +/- 4% of maximum). Due to its low intrinsic activity, coincubation with anandamide effectively attenuated the functional activity of 2-AG at hCB2. Collectively, the data showed that both endocannabinoids bound hCB2 with similar affinity, but only 2-AG functioned as a full agonist. Moreover, the agonistic activity of 2-AG was attenuated by anandamide.

However, their fast degradation by two major peptidases, neprilysin (NEP) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), has hitherto limited clinical success. We have recently shown that palmitoylation at the epsilon-amine of Lys(7) in [Tc-99m]Tc-[Lys(7)]DT1 (DT1, N-4-Gly-Arg-Arg-Pro-Tyr-Ile-Leu-OH, N-4 = 6-(carboxy)-1,4,8,11-tetraazaundecane) led to the fully stabilized [Tc-99m]Tc-DT9 analog, displaying high uptake in human pancreatic cancer AsPC-1 xenografts but unfavorable pharmacokinetics in mice. Aiming to improve the in vivo stability of [Tc-99m]Tc-DT1 without compromising pharmacokinetics, we now introduce three new [Tc-99m]Tc-DT1 mimics, carrying different pendant groups at the epsilon-amine of Lys(7): MPBA (4-(4-methylphenyl)butyric acid)-[Tc-99m]Tc-DT10; MPBA via a PEG4-linker-[Tc-99m]Tc-DT11; or a hydrophilic PEG6 chain-[Tc-99m]Tc-DT12. The impact of these modifications on receptor affinity and internalization was studied in NTS1R-positive cells. The effects on stability and AsPC-1 tumor uptake were assessed in mice without or during NEP/ACE inhibition. Unlike [Tc-99m]Tc-DT10, the longer-chain modified [Tc-99m]Tc-DT11 and [Tc-99m]Tc-DT12 were significantly stabilized in vivo, resulting in markedly improved tumor uptake compared to [Tc-99m]Tc-DT1. [Tc-99m]Tc-DT11 was found to achieve the highest AsPC-1 tumor values and good pharmacokinetics, either without or during NEP inhibition, qualifying for further validation in patients with NTS1R-positive tumors using SPECT/CT.

The inherent biological heterogeneity of neuroendocrine and prostate cancers may make the prospect of establishing cohort-based dose-response relationships unobtainable. Instead, an individual-based approach, monitoring the dose-response within each tumor could provide the necessary metric to monitor treatment efficacy.Methods: We developed a dual isotope SPECT imaging strategy to monitor the change over time in the relationship between 177Lu-DOTATATE and 111In-anti-?H2AX-TAT, a modified radiolabelled antibody that allows imaging of DNA double strand breaks, in mice bearing rat pancreatic cancer xenografts. The dynamics of ?H2AX foci, apoptosis and senescence following exposure to 177Lu-DOTATATE was further investigated in vitro and in ex vivo tumor sections.Results: The change in slope of the 111In-anti-?H2AX-TAT to 177Lu signal between days 5 and 7 was found to be highly predictive of survival (r = 0.955, P < 0.0001). This pivotal timeframe was investigated further in vitro: clonogenic survival correlated with the number of ?H2AX foci at day 6 (r =-0.995, P < 0.0005). While there was evidence of continuously low levels of apoptosis, delayed induction of senescence in vitro appeared to better account for the ?H2AX response to 177Lu. The induction of senescence was further investigated by ex vivo analysis and corresponded with sustained retention of 177Lu within tumor regions. Conclusions: Dual isotope SPECT imaging can provide individualized tumor dose-responses that can be used to predict lutetium-177 treatment efficacy. This bio-dosimeter metric appears to be dependent upon the extent of senescence induction and suggests an integral role that senescence plays in lutetium-177 treatment efficacy.

Radiotracers derived from D-amino acids (DAAs) show promise as bacterial-specific positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agents due to their preferential consumption by bacteria and largely nonutilization by hosts. Unlike mammals, fungi can utilize external DAAs including D-glutamine for their growth by rapidly upregulating DAA oxidases. Additionally, glutamine is essential for fungal nitrogen assimilation, survival, and virulence. We previously validated D-[5-11C]-glutamine (D-[5-11C]-Gln) as an efficient radiotracer targeting live bacterial soft-tissue infections. Here, we further expanded this investigation to evaluate its translational potential for PET imaging of IFIs in immunocompetent mouse models subcutaneously (SubQ) and intramuscularly (IM) infected with Candida albicans (C. albicans), using its L-isomer counterpart (L-[5-11C]-Gln) as a control. Comparative studies between pathogens showed significantly (p < 0.05) higher uptake in fungi (C. albicans and C. tropicalis) versus tested bacterial species for D-[5-11C]-Gln, suggesting that it could potentially serve as a more sensitive radiotracer for detection of fungal infections. Additionally, comparative PET imaging studies in immunocompetent infected mice demonstrated significantly higher infection-to-background ratios for D- versus L-[5-11C]-Gln in both SubQ (ratio = 1.97, p = 0.043) and IM (ratio = 1.97, p = 0.028) infections. Fungal infection imaging specificity was confirmed with no significant difference observed between localized inflammation sites versus untreated muscle background (heat-killed injection site/untreated muscle: similar to 1.1). Taken together, this work demonstrates the translational potential of D-[5-11C]-Gln for noninvasive PET imaging of IFIs.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are key elements in TME playing a pivotal role in cancer cells' proliferation and metastatic spreading. Considering the high expression of the fibroblast activation protein (FAP) on the cell membrane, CAFs emerged as appealing TME targets, namely for molecular imaging, leading to a pan-tumoral approach. Therefore, FAP inhibitors (FAPis) have recently been developed for PET imaging and radioligand therapy, exploring the clinical application in different tumor sub-types. The present review aimed to describe recent developments regarding radiolabeled FAP inhibitors and evaluate the possible translation of this pan-tumoral approach in clinical practice. At present, the application of FAPi-PET has been explored mainly in single-center studies, generally performed in small and heterogeneous cohorts of oncological patients. However, preliminary results were promising, in particular in low FDG-avid tumors, such as primary liver and gastro-entero-pancreatic cancer, or in regions with an unfavorable tumor-to-background ratio at FDG-PET/CT (i.e., brain), and in radiotherapy planning of head and neck tumors. Further promising results have been obtained in the detection of peritoneal carcinomatosis, especially in ovarian and gastric cancer. Data regarding the theranostics approach are still limited at present, and definitive conclusions about its efficacy cannot be drawn at present. Nevertheless, the use of FAPi-based radio-ligand to treat the TME has been evaluated in first-inhuman studies and appears feasible. Although the pan-tumoral approach in molecular imaging showed promising results, its real impact in day-to-day clinical practice has yet to be confirmed, and multi-center prospective studies powered for efficacy are needed.

Site-Specific Conjugation of Metal-Chelating Polymers to Anti-Frizzled-2 Antibodies <i>via</i> Microbial Transglutaminase	BIOMACROMOLECULES			English	Article							INDUCED AGGREGATION; TRASTUZUMAB; AFFINITY; IN-111; MCPS; PHARMACOKINETICS; ASSAY; TUMOR; TAG	Metal-chelating polymer-based radioimmunoconjugates (RICs) are effective agents for radioimmunotherapy but are currently limited by nonspecific binding and off-target organ uptake. Nonspecific binding appears after conjugation of the polymer to the antibody and may be related to random lysine conjugation since the polymers themselves do not bind to cells. To investigate the role of conjugation sites on nonspecific binding of polymer RICs, we developed a microbial transglutaminase reaction to prepare site-specific antibody-polymer conjugates. The reaction was enabled by introducing a Qtag (i.e., 7M48) into antibody (i.e., Fab) fragments and synthesizing a polyglutamide-based metal-chelating polymer with a PEG amine block to yield substrates. Mass spectrometric analyses confirmed that the microbial transglutaminase conjugation reaction was site-specific. For comparison, random lysine conjugation analogs with an average of one polymer per Fab were prepared by bis-aryl hydrazone conjugation. Conjugates were prepared from an anti-frizzled-2 Fab to target the Wnt pathway, along with a nonbinding specificity control, anti-Luciferase Fab. Fabs were engineered from a trastuzumab-based IgG1 framework and lack lysines in the antigen-binding site. Conjugates were analyzed for thermal conformational stability by differential scanning fluorimetry, which showed that the site-specific conjugate had a similar melting temperature to the parent Fab. Binding assays by biolayer interferometry showed that the site-specific anti-frizzled-2. conjugate maintained high affinity to the antigen, while the random conjugate showed a 10-fold decrease in affinity, which was largely due to changes in association rates. Radioligand cell-binding assays on frizzled-2+ PANC-1 cells and frizzled-2- CHO cells showed that the site-specific anti-frizzled-2 conjugate had ca. 4-fold lower nonspecific binding compared to the random conjugate. Site-specific conjugation appeared to reduce nonspecific binding associated with random conjugation of the polymer in polymer RICs.

Radionuclide therapy efficacy may even be improved by using the alpha emitter Ac-225. Higher efficacy is claimed due to high linear energy transfer specifically towards PSMA positive cells, causing more double-strand breaks. This study aims to manufacture [Ac-225]Ac-PSMA-I&T according to good manufacturing practice guidelines for the translation of [Ac-225]Ac-PSMA-I&T into a clinical phase 1 dose escalation study. Quencher addition during labeling was investigated. Quality control of [Ac-225]Ac-PSMA-I&T was based on measurement of Fr-221 (218 keV), in equilibrium with Ac-225 in approximately six half-lives of Fr-221 (T1/2 = 4.8 min). Radio-(i)TLC methods were utilized for identification of the different radiochemical forms, gamma counter for concentration determination, and HPGe-detector for the detection of the radiochemical yield. Radiochemical purity was determined by HPLC. The final patient dose was prepared and diluted with an optimized concentration of quenchers as during labeling, with an activity of 8-12 MBq (+/- 5%), pH > 5.5, 100 +/- 20 mu g/dose, PSMA-I&T, radiochemical yield >95%, radiochemical purity >90% (up to 3 h), endotoxin levels of <5 EU/mL, osmolarity of 2100 mOsmol, and is produced according to current guidelines. The start of the phase I dose escalation study is planned in the near future.

We evaluated the quantification of [F-18]FEOBV in rats in control conditions and after partial saturation of VAChT using plasma and reference tissue input models and test-retest reliability. Procedure Ninety-minute dynamic [F-18]FEOBV PET scans with arterial blood sampling were performed in control rats and rats pretreated with 10 mu g/kg FEOBV. Kinetic analyses were performed using one- (1TCM) and two-tissue compartmental models (2TCM), Logan and Patlak graphical analyses with metabolite-corrected plasma input, reference tissue Patlak with cerebellum as reference tissue, standard uptake value (SUV) and SUV ratio (SUVR) using 60- or 90-min acquisition. To assess test-retest reliability, two dynamic [F-18]FEOBV scans were performed 1 week apart. Results The 1TCM did not fit the data. Time-activity curves were more reliably estimated by the irreversible than the reversible 2TCM for 60 and 90 min as the influx rate K(i)showed a lower coefficient of variation (COV, 14-24 %) than the volume of distribution V-T(16-108 %). Patlak graphical analysis showed a good fit to the data for both acquisition times with a COV (12-27 %) comparable to the irreversible 2TCM. For 60 min, Logan analysis performed comparably to both irreversible models (COV 14-32 %) but showed lower sensitivity to VAChT saturation. Partial saturation of VAChT did not affect model selection when using plasma input. However, poor correlations were found between irreversible 2TCM and SUV and SUVR in partially saturated VAChT states. Test-retest reliability and intraclass correlation for SUV were good.

Dual Radionuclide Theranostic Pretargeting	MOLECULAR PHARMACEUTICS			English	Article						pretargeting; multistep targeting; inverse electron demand Diels-Alder reaction; tetrazine; trans-cyclooctene; click chemistry; bioorthogonal chemistry; positron emission tomography; PET; theranostics; pretargeted radioimmunotherapy; colorectal cancer; huA33; A33 antigen	MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY A33; COLORECTAL-CARCINOMA; PET; BIODISTRIBUTION; CHEMISTRY; DOSIMETRY; DIAGNOSIS; STRATEGY; ANTIGEN; CANCER	Recent years have played witness to the advent of nuclear theranostics: the synergistic use of "matched pair" radiopharmaceuticals for diagnostic imaging and targeted radiotherapy. In this investigation, we report the extension of this concept to in vivo pretargeting based on the rapid and bioorthogonal inverse electron demand Diels-Alder reaction between tetrazine (Tz) and trans-cyclooctene (TCO). We demonstrate that a single injection of a TCO-modified immunoconjugate can be used as a platform for pretargeted PET imaging and radiotherapy via the sequential administration of a pair of Tz-bearing radioligands labeled with the positron-emitting radiometal copper-64 (t(1/2) approximate to 12.7 h) and the beta-emitting radiometal lutetium-177 (t(1/)(2) approximate to 6.7 days). More specifically, a mouse model of human colorectal carcinoma received a dose of the A33 antigen-targeting immunoconjugate huA33-TCO, followed 24 and 48 h later by injections of [Cu-64]Cu-SarAr-Tz and [Lu-177]Lu-DOTA-PEG(7)-Tz, respectively. This approach produces high activity concentrations of both radioligands in tumor tissue (16.4 +/- 2.7 %ID/g for [Cu-64]Cu-SarAr-Tz at 48 h post-injection and 18.1 +/- 2.1 %ID/g for [Lu-177]Lu-DOTA-PEG(7)-Tz at 120 h post-injection) as well as promising tumor-to-healthy organ activity concentration ratios. Ultimately, we believe that this work could not only have important implications in nuclear theranostics-most excitingly with isotopologue-based radioligand pairs such as [Cu-64]Cu-SarAr-Tz and [Cu-67]Cu-SarAr-Tz-but also in the delivery of fractionated doses during pretargeted radioimmunotherapy.

Kinetic and system bias as drivers of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 allosteric modulator pharmacology	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Biased modulation; Kinetics; Negative allosteric modulator; Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; SIGNAL-REGULATED KINASE; IN-VIVO; 2-METHYL-6-(PHENYLETHYNYL)-PYRIDINE MPEP; SUBTYPE-5 ANTAGONISTS; MGLUR5 ANTAGONISTS; ANXIOLYTIC-LIKE; POTENT; RAT; CALCIUM	Allosteric modulators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGlu(5)) have been proposed as potential therapies for various CNS disorders. These ligands bind to sites distinct from the orthosteric (or endogenous) ligand, often with improved subtype selectivity and spatio-temporal control over receptor responses. We recently revealed that mGlu(5) allosteric agonists and positive allosteric modulators exhibit biased agonism and/or modulation. To establish whether negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) engender similar bias, we rigorously characterized the pharmacology of eight diverse mGlu(5) NAMs. Radioligand inhibition binding studies revealed novel modes of interaction with mGlu5 for select NAMs, with biphasic or incomplete inhibition of the radiolabeled NAM, [H-3]methoxy-PEPy. We assessed mGlu(5)-mediated intracellular Ca2+ (iCa(2+)) mobilization and inositol phosphate (IP1) accumulation in HEK293A cells stably expressing low levels of mGlu(5) (HEK293A-rat mGlu(5)-low) and mouse embryonic cortical neurons. The apparent affinity of acetylenic NAMs, MPEP, MTEP and dipraglurant, was dependent on the signaling pathway measured, agonist used, and cell type (HEK293A-rat mGlu(5)-low versus mouse cortical neurons). In contrast, the acetylenic partial NAM, M-5MPEP, and structurally distinct NAMs (VU0366248, VU0366058, fenobam), had similar affinity estimates irrespective of the assay or cellular background. Biased modulation was evident for VU0366248 in mouse cortical neurons where it was a NAM for DHPG-mediated iCa(2+) mobilization, but neutral with DHPG in IP1 accumulation assays. Overall, this study highlights the inherent complexity in mGlu(5) NAM pharmacology that we hypothesize may influence interpretation when translating into preclinical models and beyond in the design and development of novel therapeutics for neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders.

Switching radiometal from Ga-68 to In-111 impaired tumor targeting in mice, but coinjection of the neprilysin (NEP)-inhibitor phosphoramidon (PA) stabilized In-111-SB3 in circulation and remarkably increased tumor uptake. We herein report on the biological profile of In-111-SB4: In-111-[dAla(11)]SB3. Methods: The biological responses of In-111-SB3/SB4 were compared in PC-3 cells and animal models. Results: Gly(11)/dAla(11)-replacement deteriorated GRPR-affinity (SB4 IC50: 10.7 +/- 0.9 nM vs. SB3 IC50: 4.6 +/- 0.3 nM) and uptake in PC-3 cells (In-111-SB4: 1.3 +/- 0.4% vs. In-111-SB3 16.2 +/- 0.8% at 1 h). In-111-SB4 was more stable than In-111-SB3, but PA-coinjection stabilized both radiotracers in peripheral mice blood. Unmodified In-111-SB3 showed higher uptake in PC-3 xenografts (8.8 +/- 3.0%ID/g) vs. In-111-SB4 (3.1 +/- 1.1%ID/g) at 4 h pi. PA-coinjection improved tumor uptake, with In-111-SB3 still showing superior tumor targeting (38.3 +/- 7.9%ID/g vs. 7.4 +/- 0.3%ID/g for In-111-SB4). Conclusions: Replacement of Gly(11) by dAla(11) improved in vivo stability, however, at the cost of GRPR-affinity and cell uptake, eventually translating into inferior tumor uptake of In-111-SB4 vs. unmodified In-111-SB3. On the other hand, in-situ NEP-inhibition turned out to be a more efficient and direct strategy to optimize the in vivo profile of In-111-SB3, and potentially other peptide radiotracers.

A prospective phase-II study (EUDRACT/RSO,2016-002732-32) on mCRPC is ongoing at IRST (Meldola, Italy). A total of 9 patients (median age: 68 y, range: 53-85) were enrolled for dosimetry evaluation of parotid glands (PGs), kidneys, red marrow (RM) and whole body (WB). Folic polyglutamate tablets were orally administered as PGs protectors and 500 mL of a 10% mannitol solution was intravenously infused to reduce kidney uptake. The whole body planar image (WBI) and blood samples were acquired at different times post infusion (1 h, 16-24 h, 36-48 h and 120 h). Dose calculation was performed with MIRD formalism (OLINDA/EXM software). The median effective half-life was 33.0 h (range: 25.6-60.7) for PGs, 31.4 h (12.2-80.6) for kidneys, 8.2 h (2.5-14.7) for RM and 40.1 h (31.6-79.7) for WB. The median doses were 0.48 mGy/MBq (range: 0.33-2.63) for PGs, 0.70 mGy/MBq (0.26-1.07) for kidneys, 0.044 mGy/MBq (0.023-0.067) for RM and 0.04 mGy/MBq (0.02-0.11) for WB. A comparison with previously published dosimetric data was performed and a significant difference was found for PGs while no significant difference was observed for the kidneys. For PGs, the possibility of reducing uptake by administering glutamate tablets during RLT seems feasible while further research is warranted for a more focused evaluation of the reduction in kidney uptake.

The present study investigated the hypothesis that subacute neuroinflammation and microstructural changes correlate with chronic TBI deficits. Rats were subjected to controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury, sham surgery, or skin incision (naive). CCI-injured (n=18) and sham-operated rats (n=6) underwent positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with the translocator protein 18kDa (TSPO) radioligand [F-18]PBR111 and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in the subacute phase (3 weeks post-injury) to quantify inflammation and microstructural alterations. CCI-injured, sham-operated, and naive rats (n=8) underwent behavioral testing in the chronic phase (5.5-10 months post-injury): open field and sucrose preference tests, two one-week video-electroencephalogram (vEEG) monitoring periods, pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) seizure susceptibility tests, and a Morris water maze (MWM) test. In vivo imaging revealed pronounced neuroinflammation, decreased fractional anisotropy, and increased diffusivity in perilesional cortex and ipsilesional hippocampus of CCI-injured rats. Behavioral analysis revealed disinhibition, anhedonia, increased seizure susceptibility, and impaired learning in CCI-injured rats. Subacute TSPO expression and changes in DTI metrics significantly correlated with several chronic deficits (Pearson's |r|=0.50-0.90). Certain specific PET and DTI parameters had good sensitivity and specificity (area under the receiver operator characteristic [ROC] curve=0.85-1.00) to distinguish between TBI animals with and without particular behavioral deficits. Depending on the investigated behavioral deficit, PET or DTI data alone, or the combination, could very well predict the variability in functional outcome data (adjusted R-2=0.54-1.00). Taken together, both TSPO PET and DTI seem promising prognostic biomarkers to predict different chronic TBI sequelae.

We investigated cAMP cascade activity by using C-11-(R)-rolipram to image phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) in unmedicated MDD patients and after similar to 8 weeks of treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). C-11-(R)-rolipram positron emission tomographic (PET) scans were performed in 44 unmedicated patients during a major depressive episode and 35 healthy controls. Twenty-three of the 44 patients had a follow-up C-11-(R)-rolipram PET scan similar to 8 weeks after treatment with an SSRI. Patients were moderately depressed (Montgomery-sberg Depression Rating Scale = 30 +/- 6) and about half were treatment naive. C-11-(R)-rolipram binding was measured using arterial sampling to correct for individual differences in radioligand metabolism. We found in unmedicated MDD patients widespread, similar to 20% reductions in C-11-(R)-rolipram binding compared with controls (P=0.001). SSRI treatment significantly increased rolipram binding (12%, P<0.001), with significantly greater increases observed in older patients (P<0.001). Rolipram binding did not correlate with severity of baseline symptoms, and increased rolipram binding during treatment did not correlate with symptom improvement. In brief, consistent with the results of basic studies, PDE4 was decreased in unmedicated MDD patients and increased after SSRI treatment. The lack of correlation between PDE4 binding and depressive symptoms could reflect the heterogeneity of the disease and/or the heterogeneity of the target, given that PDE4 has four subtypes. These results suggest that PDE4 inhibitors, which increase cAMP cascade activity, may have antidepressant effects.	[Fujita, M.; Zoghbi, S. S.; Hong, J.; Telu, S.; Hines, C. S.; Pike, V. W.; Innis, R.

Therefore, it plays an important role in the regulation of motor, reward, and cognitive processes. Despite the interest in PDE10A as a drug and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging target, little is known about the regulation of PDE10A enzymatic activity. This study aimed to further investigate the role of cAMP in the regulation of PDE10A activity and PDE10A PET imaging. Using [F-18]JNJ42259152 as radioligand, we investigated alterations in PDE10A binding secondary to changes in cAMP levels. An invitro striatum homogenate binding assay was developed to determine K-D and B-max of [F-18]JNJ42259152. Homogenate binding was assessed after addition of increasing concentrations of exogenous cAMP (1, 10, and 100M). Rats were treated using JNJ49137530 and rolipram to induce invivo alterations of cAMP. The effect of the induced cAMP alterations on PDE10A binding was assessed by comparing [F-18]JNJ42259152 microPET studies after treatment to microPET studies acquired at baseline conditions prior to treatment. In vitro binding affinity of [F-18]JNJ42259152 was higher in the presence of cAMP compared to baseline conditions (K-D=3.170.91 nM with 10M cAMP vs. K-D=6.62 +/- 0.7 nM at baseline). Inhibition of PDE4 using rolipram significantly increased [F-18]JNJ42259152 binding (BPND=2.61 +/- 0.50 vs. 1.91 +/- 0.36 at baseline). Administration of the PDE2 inhibitor JNJ49137530 significantly increased PDE10A binding potential (BPND=2.74 +/- 0.22 vs. 2.05 +/- 0.16 at baseline). Our data indicate an important role for cAMP in the regulation of PDE10A activity. Additionally, our data show a profound interaction between several PDEs in striatum.

There is a paucity of data on human brain alterations in NK1 expression, how this system may be affected by treatment, and interactions between central and peripheral tissue alterations. Ten subjects with chronic tennis elbow (lateral epicondylosis) were selected out of a larger (n = 120) randomized controlled trial evaluating graded exercise as a treatment for chronic tennis elbow (lateral epicondylosis). These ten subjects were examined by positron emission tomography (PET) with the NK1-specific radioligand 11C-GR205171 before, and eight patients were followed up after treatment with graded exercise. Brain binding in the ten patients before treatment, reflecting NK1-receptor availability (NK1-RA), was compared to that of 18 healthy subjects and, longitudinally, to the eight of the original ten patients that agreed to a second PET examination after treatment. Before treatment, patients had significantly lower NK1-RA in the insula, vmPFC, postcentral gyrus, anterior cingulate, caudate, putamen, amygdala and the midbrain but not the thalamus and cerebellum, with the largest difference in the insula contralateral to the injured elbow. No significant correlations between brain NK1-RA and pain, functional severity, or peripheral NK1-RA in the affected limb were observed. In the eight patients examined after treatment, pain ratings decreased in everyone, but there were no significant changes in NK1-RA. These findings indicate a role for the substance P (SP) / NK1 receptor system in musculoskeletal pain and tissue healing. As neither clinical parameters nor successful treatment response was reflected in brain NK1-RA after treatment, this may reflect the diverse function of the SP/NK1 system in CNS and peripheral tissue, or a change too small or slow to capture over the three-month treatment.

Although novel ligands have been identified using methods such as virtual screening, computationally driven lead optimization has been possible only in isolated cases because of challenges associated with predicting binding free energies for related compounds. Here, we provide a systematic characterization of the performance of free-energy perturbation (FEP) calculations to predict relative binding free energies of congeneric ligands binding to GPCR targets using a consistent protocol and no adjustable parameters. Using the FEP+ package, first we validated the protocol, which includes a full lipid bilayer and explicit solvent, by predicting the binding affinity for a total of 45 different ligands across four different GPCRs (adenosine A(2A)AR, beta(1) adrenergic, CXCR4 chemokine, and delta opioid receptors). Comparison with experimental binding affinity measurements revealed a highly predictive ranking correlation (average spearman rho = 0.55) and low root-mean-square error (0.80 kcal/mol). Next, we applied FEP+ in a prospective project, where we predicted the affinity of novel, potent adenosine A2A receptor (A(2A)R) antagonists. Four novel compounds were synthesized and tested in a radioligand displacement assay, yielding affinity values in the nanomolar range. The affinity of two out of the four novel ligands (plus three previously reported compounds) was correctly predicted (within 1 kcal/mol), including one compound with approximately a tenfold increase in affinity compared to the starting compound. Detailed analyses of the simulations underlying the predictions provided insights into the structural basis for the two cases where the affinity was overpredicted. Taken together, these results establish a protocol for systematically applying FEP+ to GPCRs and provide guidelines for identifying potent molecules in drug discovery lead optimization projects.

Aim of present study was to characterize these receptors in rat bladder urothelium and detrusor muscle using selective radioligands of [N-methyl-H-3]scopolamine methyl chloride ([H-3]NMS) and alpha beta-methylene ATP [2,8-H-3]tetrasodium salt ([H-3]alpha beta-MeATP). Similar binding parameters for each radioligand were observed in urothelium and detrusor muscle. Pretreatment with N-(2-chloroethyl)-4-piperidinyl diphenylacetate (4-DAMP mustard) mustard revealed co-existence of M-2 and M-3 receptors, with the number of M-2 receptors being larger in the urothelium and detrusor muscle. Intravesical administration of imidafenacin and Dpr-P-4 (N -> O) (active metabolite of propiverine) displayed significant binding of muscarinic receptors in the urothelium and detrusor muscle. The treatment with cyclophosphamide (CYP) or resiniferatoxin (RTX) resulted in a significant decrease in maximal number of binding sites (B-max) for [H-3] NMS and/or [H-3] alpha beta-MeATP in the urothelium and detrusor muscle. These results demonstrated that 1) pharmacological characteristics of muscarinic and P2X receptors in rat bladder urothelium were similar to those in the detrusor muscle, 2) that densities of these receptors were significantly altered by pretreatments with CYP and RTX, and 3) that these receptors may be pharmacologically affected by imidafenacin and Dpr-P-4 (N -> O) which are excreted in the urine.

In spite of their benefits they have several side effects, so synthesis of new agonists of these receptors to get more specific effect and better profile of adverse drug reactions is still continued. Novel BZD agonists were designed based on the pharmacophore/receptor model of BZD binding site of GABA(A) receptor. Energy minima conformers of the designed compounds and estazolam, a known BZD receptor agonist, were well superimposed in conformational analysis. Docking studies revealed that the carbonyl group of the compound 4c, 3-(2-chlorobenzyl)-5-methyl-2-phenyl-[1,2,4] triazolo[1,5-a] pyrimidin-7(3H)-one, was near the nitrogen moiety of triazole ring of estazolam providing the hydrogen bond acceptor in proper direction in the BDZ-binding site of GABAA receptor model (alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2). The designed compounds were synthesized and their in vitro affinity for the central BZD receptor was determined. Most of the novel compounds had better affinity for the BZD site of action on GABAA receptor complex than diazepam. Finally, the novel compound 4c with the best affinity in radioligand receptor binding assay (K-i = 0.42 nM and IC50 = 0.68 nM) was selected as candidate for in vivo evaluation. This compound showed significant hypnotic activity and weak anticonvulsant effect with no impairment on learning and memory performance in mouse. The pharmacological effects of the compound 4c were antagonized by flumazenil, a BZD antagonist, which confirms the involvement of BZD receptors in the biological effects of the novel ligand.

Reductions in Brain 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> Receptor Availability in Primarily Cocaine-Dependent Humans	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						5-HT1B; cocaine; human; serotonin; PET; VBM	ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; SEROTONIN RECEPTOR; 1B; EXPRESSION; DOPAMINE; RADIOLIGAND; STRESS; POLYMORPHISMS; VULNERABILITY; ASSOCIATION	Background: Preclinical evidence implicates the serotonin receptor 5-hydroxytryptamine 1B (5-HT1B) in the effects of cocaine. This study explores 5-HT1B in humans by examining receptor availability in vivo in subjects whose primary addiction is cocaine dependence (CD) using positron emission tomography. Methods: Study participants included 14 medically healthy subjects with CD (mean age =41 +/- 6 years) who were compared with 14 age-matched healthy control subjects (mean age =41 +/- 8 years) with no past or current history of cocaine or other illicit substance abuse. Participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging followed by positron emission tomography with the highly selective 5-HT1B tracer, [C-11]P943, for purposes of quantifying regional binding potential. Voxel-based morphometry and gray matter masking also were employed to control for potential partial volume effects. Results: The [C-11]P943 positron emission tomography imaging data in nine candidate regions (amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, caudate, frontal cortex, hypothalamus, pallidum, putamen, thalamus, and ventral striatum) showed significant or nearly significant reductions of regional binding potential in subjects with CD in three regions: anterior cingulate (-16%, p < .01), hypothalamus (-16%, p = .03), and frontal cortex (-7%, p = .08). Voxel-based morphometry showed significant gray matter reductions in the frontal cortex of subjects with CD. After gray matter masking, statistically significant reductions in the [C-11]P943 regional binding potential were either retained (anterior cingulate, -14%, p = .01; hypothalamus, -20%, p < .01) or achieved (frontal cortex, -14%, p = .01). Whole-brain voxel-wise parameter estimation confirmed these results. Secondary analyses were also significant in some regions for years of cocaine and daily tobacco use. Conclusions: The reductions found in this study suggest that 5-HT1B receptors may contribute to the etiology or expression of CD and potentially represent a target for medication development.

Translocator protein (18 kDa) (TSPO), a mitochondrial transmembrane protein, plays important roles in modulating mitochondrial function. This study explored whether TSPO can be used as an imaging biomarker of non-invasive diagnosis and staging of NAFLD, monitored using positron emission tomography (PET) with a TSPO radioligand [F-18]FEDAC. Methods: PET with [F-18]FEDAC, non-enhanced computerized tomography (CT), autoradiography, histopathology, and gene analysis were performed to evaluate and quantify TSPO levels and NAFLD progression in methionine and choline-deficient diet-fed mice. Correlations were analyzed between uptake ratio of radioactivity and NAFLD activity score (NAS) in the liver. Results: Uptake of [F-18]FEDAC obviously increased with disease progression from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (p <0.01). A close correlation was identified between [F-18]FEDAC uptake ratio and NAS in the liver (Pearson's r = 0.922, p = 0.000). Specific binding of [F-18]FEDAC to TSPO in the NAFLD livers was assessed in competition studies with the unlabelled TSPO-selective ligand PK11195. Autoradiography and histopathology confirmed the PET imaging results. Further, the mRNA levels of the functional macromolecular signaling complex composed of TSPO were obviously higher compared to controls. Conclusions: TSPO expression increases in NAFLD and closely correlates with NAFLD progression. TSPO as a specific molecular imaging biomarker may open a novel avenue for non-invasive, reliable, and quantitative diagnosis and staging of NAFLD.

The objective of this study was to investigate whether in humans, like previous observations made in animals, the effects of MDMA on the 5-HT system are dependent on age-of-first exposure. Methods: 5-HT transporter (SERT) densities in the frontal cortex and midbrain were assessed with [123 I] b-CIT single photon emission computed tomography in 33 users of ecstasy. Subjects were stratified for early-exposed users (age-at-first exposure 14-18 years; developing brain), and late-exposed users (age-at-first exposure 18-36 years; mature brain). In parallel, we investigated the effects of age experimentally with MDMA in early-exposed (adolescent) rats and late-exposed (adult) rats using the same radioligand. Results: On average, five years after first exposure, we found a strong inverse relationship, wherein age-at-first exposure predicted 79% of the midbrain SERT variability in early (developing brain) exposed ecstasy users, whereas this was only 0.3% in late (mature brain) exposed users (p = 0.007). No such effect was observed in the frontal cortex. In rats, a significant age-BY-treatment effect (p<0.01) was observed as well, however only in the frontal cortex. Conclusions: These age-related effects most likely reflect differences in the maturational stage of the 5-HT projection fields at age-at-first exposure and enhanced outgrowth of the 5-HT system due to 5-HT's neurotrophic effects. Ultimately, our findings stress the need for more knowledge on the effects of pharmacotherapies that alter brain 5-HT levels in the pediatric population.

Although functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers high temporal and spatial resolution, most studies available were done with radioligand-positron emission tomography, as fMRI requires non-magnetic stimulus equipment and fast on-off conditions. We developed a new approach for painful stimulation of the trigeminal nerve that can be implemented within an event-related design using fMRI and aimed to detect increased blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals as surrogate markers of trigeminal pain processing. Using an olfactometer, 20 healthy volunteers received intranasally standardized trigeminal nociceptive stimuli (ammonia gas) as well as olfactory (rose odour) and odourless control stimuli (air puffs). Imaging revealed robust BOLD responses to the trigeminal nociceptive stimulation in cortical and subcortical brain areas known to be involved in pain processing. Focusing on the trigeminal pain pathway, significant activations were observed bilaterally in brainstem areas at the trigeminal nerve entry zone, which are agreeable with the principal trigeminal nuclei. Furthermore, increased signal changes could be detected ipsilaterally at anatomical localization of the trigeminal ganglion and bilaterally in the rostral medulla, which probably represents the spinal trigeminal nuclei. However, brainstem areas involved in the endogenous pain control system that are close to this anatomical localization, such as raphe nuclei, have to be discussed. Our findings suggest that mapping trigeminal pain processing using fMRI with this non-invasive experimental design is feasible and capable of evoking specific activations in the trigeminal nociceptive system. This method will provide an ideal opportunity to study the trigeminal pain system in both health and pathological conditions such as idiopathic headache disorders.

Involvement of D-1 receptor was also examined during AS and CUS using A 68930, a D-1 selective agonist. Rats were exposed to AS (single immobilization for 150 min) and CUS (two different stressors for 7 days). AS significantly decreased the DA levels in the striatum and hippocampus, and A 68930 pretreatment significantly reverted these changes. However, in the frontal cortex significantly increased DA levels were remain unchanged following A 68930. CUS led to a decrease of DA levels in the frontal cortex, striatum and hippocampus, which were normalized by A 68930. Saturation radioligand binding assays revealed a significant decrease in the number of D-1-like receptors in the frontal cortex during CUS, which were further decreased by A 68930 pretreatment. However, in the striatum and hippocampus, A 68930 pretreatment reduced the CUS induced increase in the number of D-1-like receptors. No significant changes were observed in the amygdala and orbito-frontal cortex during AS and CUS, while D-2-like receptors were unchanged in all the brain regions studied. Locomotor activity was significantly decreased in both the stress models, A 68930 pretreatment significantly increased stereotypic counts and horizontal activity. Thus, present investigation provide insights into the differential regional response of dopaminergic system during AS and CUS. Further, neurochemical and behavioral effects of D-1 agonist pretreatment suggest specific modulatory role of D-1 receptor under such stressful episodes.

Its output is increased under conditions of stress and anxiety. Its biological targets remain poorly characterized, although [H-3]isatin binding sites have been demonstrated in various brain structures. In this study, by using a real-time beta-imager, [H-3]isatin radioligand binding analysis, and proteomic identification of proteins specifically bound to the affinity sorbent 5-aminocaproyl-isatin-Sepharose, we have investigated the distribution of [H-3]isatin specific binding sites in the rat brain, characterized their K-d and B-max, and identified some individual brain isatin binding proteins. The binding of [H-3]isatin to rat brain sections was saturable and characterized by K-d values (of 0.2-0.3 mu M) consistent with physiological concentrations. The highest Bmax was found in the hypothalamus, consistent with a role in stress. In most brain regions, the homologous inhibition of [H-3]isatin binding by increasing concentrations of cold isatin demonstrated complex behavior suggesting involvement of various binding proteins characterized by different affinity to isatin. Affinity chromatography of Triton X-100 lysates of whole-brain homogenates on 5-aminocaproyl-isatin-Sepharose followed by subsequent proteomic analysis resulted in identification of 25 individual proteins, including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, one of few previously reported isatin binding proteins, and a group of cytoskeleton-related proteins. These binding sites may be related to the known antiproliferative and proapoptotic activities of isatin. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Recently, we designed and synthesized a RGD-BBN heterodimeric peptide from c(RGDyK) and BBN(7-14) through a glutamate linker. The goal of this study was to investigate the dual receptor-targeting property and tumor diagnostic value of RGD-BBN heterodimeric peptide labeled with generator-eluted Ga-68 (t(1/2) 68 min, beta(+) 89% and EC 11%), Ga-68-NOTA-RGD-BBN. RGD-BBN heterodimer was conjugated with 1,4,7-triazacyclononanetriacetic acid (NOTA) and labeled with Ga-68. The dual receptor binding affinity was investigated by a radioligand competition binding assay. The in vitro and in vivo dual receptor targeting of Ga-68-NOTA-RGD-BBN was evaluated and compared with that of Ga-68-NOTA-RGD and Ga-68-NOTA-BBN. NOTA-RGD-BBN had integrin alpha(v)beta(3) and GRPR binding affinities comparable to those of the monomeric RGD and BBN, respectively. The dual receptor targeting property of Ga-68-NOTA-RGD-BBN was validated by blocking studies in a PC-3 tumor model. Ga-68-NOTA-RGD-BBN showed higher tumor uptake than Ga-68-NOTA-RGD and Ga-68-NOTA-BBN. Ga-68-NOTA-RGD-BBN can also image tumors with either integrin or GRPR expression. Ga-68-NOTA-RGD-BBN exhibited dual receptor targeting properties both in vitro and in vivo. The favorable characterizations of Ga-68-NOTA-RGD-BBN such as convenient synthesis, high specific activity, and high tumor uptake, warrant its further investigation for clinical cancer imaging.

Localisation of melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 in rat brain and evidence that sleep parameters are not altered despite high central receptor occupancy	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1; CNS; Occupancy; EEG; (Rat)	ANTAGONIST; MICE; EFFICACY; ARCHITECTURE; BIOMARKERS; SYSTEM; SLC-1; GENE	The present study describes the optimisation of an autoradiography assay that provides a means to measure the in vitro potency of melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 (MCH(1)) antagonists in native tissues and their ex vivo receptor occupancy. Initial localisation studies demonstrated that the MCH(1) receptor radioligand [(125)1]-S36057 bound to rat caudate putamen with specific binding of consistently >60%. In vitro, the MCH(1) receptor antagonists GW3430, SNAP-94847 and 4'-{[1-(cyclopropylmethyl)piperidin-4-ylidene] [5-fluoro-6-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]methyl}biphenyl-3-carbonitrile (referred to as Compound A) exhibited concentration dependent inhibition of the specific binding of [(125)I]-S36057, with a rank order of affinity of SNAP-94847 > Compound A>GW3430. In an ex vivo occupancy assay, Compound A dosed orally to rats caused a concentration dependent inhibition of the specific binding of [(125)I]-S36057 to rat caudate putamen. The occupancy reached 87 +/- 11% at 30 mg/kg and the estimated ED(50) was 9.3 mg/kg, which was equivalent to a free plasma concentration of 40 nM. As MCH has been reported to play a role in the regulation of the sleep cycle, the effect of Compound A on sleep parameters was investigated. However Compound A, at exposures that achieved near maximal receptor occupancy, failed to demonstrate any effects on the sleep/wake pattern in telemetered rats. We conclude that our ex vivo receptor occupancy assay is suitable for selecting centrally penetrant MCH(1) receptor antagonists and that, despite high levels of receptor occupancy, the selective MCH(1) receptor antagonist Compound A failed to elicit any changes in sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) parameters.

Jeffrey			A Novel Selective Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor Subtype 1 Antagonist Reduces Seizures without Impairing Hippocampus-Dependent Learning	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							N-DESMETHYLCLOZAPINE; PYRAMIDAL CELLS; MUTANT MICE; ACTIVATION; ANTIBODIES; DISORDERS; CLOZAPINE; PROTEINS; AGONISTS; DISEASE	Previous studies suggest that selective antagonists of specific subtypes of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) may provide a novel approach for the treatment of certain central nervous system (CNS) disorders, including epileptic disorders, Parkinson's disease, and dystonia. Unfortunately, previously reported antagonists are not highly selective for specific mAChR subtypes, making it difficult to definitively establish the functional roles and therapeutic potential for individual subtypes of this receptor subfamily. The M 1 mAChR is of particular interest as a potential target for treatment of CNS disorders. We now report the discovery of a novel selective antagonist of M-1 mAChRs, termed VU0255035 [N-(3-oxo-3-(4-(pyridine-4-yl)piperazin-1-yl)propyl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-4-sulfonamide]. Equilibrium radioligand binding and functional studies demonstrate a greater than 75-fold selectivity of VU0255035 for M-1 mAChRs relative to M-2-M-5. Molecular pharmacology and mutagenesis studies indicate that VU0255035 is a competitive orthosteric antagonist of M-1 mAChRs, a surprising finding given the high level of M-1 mAChR selectivity relative to other orthosteric antagonists. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings demonstrate that VU0255035 inhibits potentiation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor currents by the muscarinic agonist carbachol in hippocampal pyramidal cells. VU0255035 has excellent brain penetration in vivo and is efficacious in reducing pilocarpine-induced seizures in mice. We were surprised to find that doses of VU0255035 that reduce pilo-carpine-induced seizures do not induce deficits in contextual freezing, a measure of hippocampus-dependent learning that is disrupted by nonselective mAChR antagonists. Taken together, these data suggest that selective antagonists of M-1 mAChRs do not induce the severe cognitive deficits seen with nonselective mAChR antagonists and could provide a novel approach for the treatment certain of CNS disorders.

We present a novel strategy toward this goal using muscarinic acetylcholine receptors as a model. The five subtypes bind their physiological transmitter in the highly conserved orthosteric site within the transmembrane domains of the receptors. Orthosteric muscarinic activators have no binding selectivity and poor signaling specificity. There is a less well conserved allosteric site at the extracellular entrance of the binding pocket. To gain subtype-selective receptor activation, we synthesized two hybrids fusing a highly potent oxotremorine-like orthosteric activator with M-2-selective bis(ammonio)alkane-type allosteric fragments. Radioligand binding in wild-type and mutant receptors supplemented by receptor docking simulations proved M-2 selective and true allosteric/orthosteric binding. G protein activation measurements using orthosteric and allosteric blockers identified the orthosteric part of the hybrid to engender receptor activation. Hybrid-induced dynamic mass redistribution in CHO-hM(2) cells disclosed pathway-specific signaling. Selective receptor activation (M-2>M-1>M-3) was verified in living tissue preparations. As allosteric sites are increasingly recognized on GPCRs, the dualsteric concept of GPCR targeting represents a new avenue toward potent agonists for selective receptor and signaling pathway activation. - Antony, J., Kellershohn, K., Mohr-Andra, M., Kebig, A., Prilla, S., Muth, M., Heller, E., Disingrini, T., Dallanoce, C., Bertoni, S., Schrobang, J., Trankle, C., Kostenis, E., Christopoulos, A., Holtje, H.-D., Barocelli, E., De Amici, M., Holzgrabe, U., Mohr, K.

Although these systems are currently used for the study of physiopathologic murine models, they present some drawbacks for brain studies, including a low temporal resolution that limits the pharmacokinetic study of radiotracers. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the ability of a radiosensitive intracerebral probe to measure the binding of a radiotracer in the mouse brain in vivo. Methods: The potential of a probe 0.25 mm in diameter for pharmacokinetic studies was assessed. First, Monte Carlo simulations followed by experimental studies were used to evaluate the detection volume and sensitivity of the probe and its adequacy for the size of loci in the mouse brain. Second, ex vivo autoradiography of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1A (5-HT1A) receptors in the mouse brain was performed with the PET radiotracer 2'-methoxyphenyl-(N-2'-pyridinyl)-p-F-18-fluorobenzamidoethylpiperazine (F-18-MPPF). Finally, the binding kinetics Of F-18-MPPF were measured in vivo in both the hippocampus and the cerebellum of mice. Results: Both the simulations and the experimental studies demonstrated the feasibility of using small probes to measure radioactive concentrations in specific regions of the mouse brain. Ex vivo autoradiography showed a heterogeneous distribution of F-18-MPPF consistent with the known distribution of 5-HT1A in the mouse brain. Finally, the time-activity curves obtained in vivo were reproducible and validated the capacity of the new probe to accurately measure F-18-MPPF kinetics in the mouse hippocampus. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the ability of the tested radiosensitive intracerebral probe to monitor binding of PET radiotracers in anesthetized mice in vivo, with high temporal resolution suited for compartmental modeling.

Methods: Binding affinity was determined through in vitro binding assays with LLC-PK1 cells overexpressing SERT, NET or DAT (LLC-SERT, LLC-NET and LLC-DAT) and with rat cortical homogenates. Localization and selectivity of [18F]1 binding in vivo were evaluated by biodistribution, autoradiography and A-PET imaging studies in rats. Results: This compound displayed excellent binding affinity for SERT in vitro with K-i=0.33 and 0.24 nM in LLC-SERT and rat cortical homogenates, respectively. Biodistribution studies with [F-18]1 showed good brain uptake (1.61% dose/g at 2 min postinjection), high uptake into the hypothalamus (1.22% dose/g at 30 min) and a high target-to-nontarget (hypothalamus to cerebellum) ratio of 9.66 at 180 min postinjection. Pretreatment with a SERT selective inhibitor considerably inhibited [F-18]1 binding in biodistribution studies. Ex vivo autoradiography reveals [F-18]1 localization to brain regions with high SERT density, and this binding was blocked by pretreatment with SERT selective inhibitors. Small animal PET (A-PET) imaging in rats provided clear images of tracer localization in the thalamus, midbrain and striatum. In A-PET chasing experiments, injecting a SERT selective inhibitor 75 min post-tracer injection causes a dramatic reduction in regional radioactivity and the target-to-nontarget ratio. Conclusion: The results of the biological studies and the ease of radiosynthesis with moderately good radiochemical yield (RCY=10-35%) make [F-18]1 an excellent candidate for SERT PET imaging.

Correlating efficacy in rodent cognition models with in vivo 5-hydroxytryptamine<sub>1A</sub> receptor occupancy by a novel antagonist, (<i>R</i>)-<i>N</i>-(2-methyl-(4-indolyl-1-piperazinyl)ethyl)-<i>N</i>-(2-pyridinyl)-cyclohexane carboxamide (WAY-101405)	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	36th Annual Meeting of the Society-for-Neuroscience	OCT 14-18, 2006	Atlanta, GA	Soc Neurosci			5-HT1A RECEPTOR; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; RAT-BRAIN; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; ENHANCING PROPERTIES; WATER MAZE; WAY-100635; MEMORY; SEROTONIN; LECOZOTAN	5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(1A) receptors play an important role in multiple cognitive processes, and compelling evidence suggests that 5-HT1A antagonists can reverse cognitive impairment. We have examined the therapeutic potential of a potent (K-i = 1.1 nM), selective (>100-fold), orally bioavailable, silent 5-HT1A receptor antagonist (K-B = 1.3 nM) (R)-N-(2-methyl-(4-indolyl-1-piperazinyl)ethyl)-N-(2-pyridinyl)-cyclohexane carboxamide (WAY-101405). Oral administration of WAY-101405 was shown to be effective in multiple rodent models of learning and memory. In a novel object recognition paradigm, 1 mg/kg enhanced retention (memory) for previously learned information, and it was able to reverse the memory deficits induced by scopolamine. WAY-101405 (1 mg/kg) was also able to reverse scopolamine-induced deficits in a rat contextual fear conditioning model. In the Morris water maze, WAY-101405 (3 mg/kg) significantly improved learning in a paradigm of increasing task difficulty. In vivo microdialysis studies in the dorsal hippocampus of freely moving adult rats demonstrated that acute administration of WAY-101405 (10 mg/kg) increased extracellular acetylcholine levels. The selective radioligand [H-3] WAY-100635, administered i.v., was used for in vivo receptor occupancy studies, where WAY-101405 occupied 5-HT1A receptors in the rat cortex, with an ED50 value of 0.1 mg/kg p.o. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that WAY-101405 is a potent and selective, brain penetrant, orally bioavailable 5-HT1A receptor "silent" antagonist that is effective in preclinical memory paradigms at doses where approximately 90% of the postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors are occupied. These results further support the rationale for use of this compound class in the treatment of cognitive dysfunction associated with psychiatric and neurological conditions.

Cyamemazine is metabolized in monodesmethyl cyamemazine and cyamemazine sulfoxide, which are not known for their affinities for serotonin, dopamine and other brain receptor types considered to mediate central nervous systems effects of drugs. Hence, metabolite affinities were determined in human recombinant receptors expressed in CHO cells (hD(2) and hD4.4 receptors, h5-HT1A, h5-HT2A, h5-HT2C and h5-HT7 receptors and hM(1), hM(2), and hM(3) receptors) and HEK-293 cells (h5-HT3 receptors) or natively present in rat cerebral cortex (non-specific alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-adrenoceptors, GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors) and guinea pig cerebellum (H-1 central histamine receptors) membranes. Monodesmethyl cyamemazine showed a neurotransmitter receptor profile similar to that of its parent compound cyamemazine, i.e.: high affinity for h5-HT2A receptors (K-i = 1.5 nM), h5-HT2C receptors (K-i = 12 nM) and hD(2) receptors (K-i = 12 nM). Cyamemazine sulfoxide showed high affinity for h5-HT2A receptors (K-i=39 nM) and histamine H, receptors (K-i=15 nM) and a reduced affinity for D-2 and 5-HT2C receptors. Therefore, monodesmethyl cyamemazine can contribute to enhance and prolong the therapeutic actions of cyamemazine. Further investigation is required to see if the high affinities of cyamemazine sulfoxide for H, and 5-HT2A receptors are of therapeutic benefit against sleep onset insomnia and/or sleep maintenance insomnia respectively.

In vivo biodistribution studies of [I-125]o- and m-BON in mice demonstrated high initial uptakes and prolonged retention in the brain. In contrast to high brain uptake and retention, the blood accumulations were low, resulting in good brain-blood ratios (7.9-9.2). In the other tissues, high uptake of [I-125]o- and m-BON were observed in the liver, kidney, heart, lung, and pancreas. Moreover, selective interactions of [I-125]o- and m-BON with sigma receptors were confirmed by pretreatment experiments with various sigma and other receptor ligands. Haloperidol posttreatment induced decreases in the accumulation of [I-125]o- and m-BON. These data suggest that [I-125]o- and m-BON binding to sigma receptors is reversible and competitive. Furthermore, ex vivo autoradiograms of [I-125]o- and m-BON in rats showed high uptake in the parietal cortex, vestibular nucleus, and pons nucleus and moderate uptake in the thalamus, inferior colliculus, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and temporal cortex. These ex vivo autoradiograms were comparable with the histochemical distribution of sigma receptors. Furthermore, the uptake of [I-125]o- and m-BON reflected quantitative amounts of sigma receptor in the brain. These results demonstrated that radiolabeled o- and m-BON have good characteristics for mapping sigma receptors in the CNS and the peripheral organs with SPECT.

The GluR1-4 affinities of 3 were similar to 1, however, its 31-fold selectivity for GluR1/2 over GluR3/4 is the highest yet observed among azine-based glutamate analogues. The non-isosteric congener 2 showed weaker binding to AMPA-Rs. In the cortical wedge, 1 evokes similar responses to AMPA, while 3 and 2 are 10- and 100-fold weaker, respectively. Dose-response curves on Xenopus l ae vis oocytes expressing GWR1-4(flip) confirmed that 1 and 3 are potent GluR1/2 receptor agonists (EC(50)s from 0.26 to 1.7 mu M) but are 10- to 160-fold less potent at GluR3/4. The structures, potencies and selectivities of this new class of AMPA agonists are compared with those of willardiine, 5-fluorowillardiine and azawillardiine, referring to the binding mode observed in the crystal structure of willardiine bound to GluR2-S1S2. The results indicate that the 3-hydroxypyridazine 1-oxide moiety can function as an outstanding carboxylate mimic at AMPA-Rs, leading the way to further fine-tuning of subtype selectivity. This little-explored molecular motif may find wider application in medicinal chemistry. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this report, we determined if alpha(2B)-ARm could modulate transport from the ER to the cell surface and signaling of its wild-type counterpart. Transient expression of alpha(2B)-ARm in HEK293T cells markedly inhibited cell-surface expression of wild-type alpha(2B)-AR, as measured by radioligand binding. Subcellular localization demonstrated that alpha(2B)-ARm trapped alpha(2B)-AR in the ER. The alpha(2B)-AR was shown to form homodimers and heterodimers with alpha(2B)-as measured by co-immunoprecipitation of the receptors tagged with green fluorescent protein and hemagglutinin epitopes. In addition to alpha(2B)-AR, the transport of a(2A)-AR and alpha(2C)-AR to the cell surface was also inhibited by alpha(2B)-ARm. Furthermore, transient expression of alpha(2B)-ARm significantly reduced cell-surface expression of endogenous alpha(2)-AR in NG108-15 and HT29 cells. Consistent with its effect on a2-AR cell-surface expression, alpha(2B)-ARm attenuated alpha(2A)-AR- and alpha(2B)-AR-mediated ERK1/2 activation. These data demonstrated that the ER-retained mutant alpha(2B)-ARm conferred a dominant negative effect on the cell-surface expression of wild-type alpha(2)-AR, which is likely mediated through heterodimerization. These data indicate a crucial role of ER export in the regulation of cell-surface targeting and signaling of G protein-coupled receptors. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Vascular adrenoceptors play an important role in vascular physiology and pathophysiology, such as hypertension, atherosclerosis and restenosis after angioplasty. To define the changes in the ene expression in vascular smooth muscle cells in response to the activation of alpha(1)- or beta-adrenoceptors, a DNA microarray was used. 2. First, the existence of alpha(1)- and beta-adrenoceptors in A7r5 aortic smooth muscle cells was confirmed by radioligand binding. Then, the inhibitory effects of phenylephrine (an alpha(1)-adrenoceptor agonist) and isoproterenol (a beta-adrenoceptor agonist) on the proliferation of A7r5 cells were determined by [H-3]-thymidine incorporation. 3. The A7r5 cells were treated with 10 mumol/L phenylephrine or 1 mumol/L isoproterenol for 24 h and changes in gene expression were detected with the DNA microarray. Only 14 and 20 genes were identified after treatment of cells with phenylephrine and isoproterenol, respectively, and most genes displayed decreased expression. The changed genes could be grouped into five major functional categories: cell signalling/ communication, cell structure/motility, cell/organism defence, gene/protein expression and metabolism. The gene expression profile in response to the activation of alpha(1)-adrenoceptors was very different from that following activation of beta-adrenoceptors. Interestingly, many phenylephrine-responsive genes were associated with metabolism, whereas many isoproterenol-responsive genes encoded cell signalling and structure proteins. This means that adrenoceptors may modulate multiple aspects of biological function in vascular smooth muscle cells. 4. Collectively, the activation of both alpha(1)-adrenoceptors (with phenylephrine) and beta-adrenoceptors (with isoproterenol) inhibited the proliferation of A7r5 cells, but microarray data revealed that the mechanisms may be different: the activation of alpha(1)-adrenoceptors could induce the expression of metabolic genes, resulting in the inhibition of proliferation, whereas activation of beta-adrenoceptors altered the expression of genes that encoded cell signalling and structure proteins to inhibit cell proliferation.

The nature of the IEA is not entirely understood; it may be microseizures or just a negative phenomenon expressing brain inhibition mechanisms. In order to understand how brain metabolism is during interictal activity we studied a group of patients with SPECT HMPAO during basal condition -no ictal activity- and when the same patients were having interictal activity. Temporal, thalamic and cerebellar perfusion were quantified by a digital method. Patients and methods: Two studies were performed in 24 epileptic patients: (9/15:M/F, 36,5 +/- 14,6 years). The MRI was normal or had minimal changes. Previous EEG had showed frontotemporal foci. The patients were studied by SPECT HMPAO performed with a STARCAM 3.200 equipment, the images being obtained by high resolution collimator with circular orbit 64 images, 30 s per image. The first study was performed when there was no anomaly in the EEG (basal study). In the second study (activated study) the radioligand was injected when the EEG showed at least 10 graphoelements (spike, polispikes, or sharp waves per EEG page). Results: Thalamic, temporal and cerebellar perfusion decreased significantly in the activated state compared to the basal one (p < 0.001). The statistical relationship between these three locations was studied. There was a significant relationship (p < 0.001) between thalamic, temporal, and cerebellar perfusion, both in basal state and in the activated one. The correlation index was R-2 > 0.9. Conclusions: For the cases studied, temporal epilepsy is associated to a significant decrease in thalamic, temporal and cerebellar perfusion in the basal state compared to the activated one. This finding may indicate that LEA expresses a post-ictal state.

We have used Scatchard analysis of saturation binding data to characterize the affinity of leptin for binding sites in bovine kidney membranes. I-125-Leptin was used in saturation studies, over a range of concentrations from 50 pM to 9 nM. I-125-Leptin differentiated a high affinity binding site from an abundant low affinity site. The high affinity/low density binding site (putative leptin receptor) had K-d = 0.098 nM and B-max = 46.2 fmol/mg protein. An additional class of low affinity, highly abundant sites with an apparent K-d = 175 nM, and B-max = 5740 fmol/mg protein was characterized. The association and dissociation kinetics for I-125-leptin binding were also studied. Dissociation of the leptin-receptor complex was very rapid, and this necessitated the use of a specially developed separation method for radioligand binding studies (precipitation with PEG and filtration). Competitive displacement of I-125-leptin by mouse and human leptin and polyclonal anti-bovine leptin antibodies was dose-dependent. Specificity of binding was shown as bound I-125-leptin was not displaced by insulin or control antibodies. These data indicate that leptin binds the bovine leptin receptor with high affinity and that a pool of leptin is bound to abundant cell membrane-associated proteins. These observations are consistent with the plasma concentration range for leptin and imply that free leptin concentration in the tissues may be partially buffered by cell-associated and bound forms in plasma. Thus, acute changes in leptin secretion may have little effect at the leptin receptor. The development of leptin agonists/antagonists should facilitate further characterization of leptin binding and clarify the role of abundant low affinity binding sites at the leptin axis.

This reaction is a target for many clinically important antibiotics. However, the molecular mechanisms of the peptidyl transfer reaction, the catalytic contribution of the ribosome, and the mechanisms of antibiotic action are still poorly understood. Here we describe a novel, simple, convenient, and sensitive method for monitoring peptidyl transferase activity (SPARK). In this method, the ribosomal peptidyl transferase forms a peptide bond between two ligands, one of which is tritiated whereas the other is biotin-tagged. Transpeptidation results in covalent attachment of the biotin moiety to a tritiated compound. The amount of the reaction product is then directly quantified using the scintillation proximity assay technology: binding of the tritiated radioligand to the commercially available streptavidin-coated beads causes excitation of the bead-embedded scintillant, resulting in detection of radioactivity. The reaction is readily inhibited by known antibiotics, inhibitors of peptide bond formation. The method we developed is amenable to simple automation which makes it useful for screening for new antibiotics. The method is useful for different types of ribosomal research. Using this method, we investigated the effect of mutations at a universally conserved nucleotide of the active site of 23S rRNA, A2602 (Escherichia coli numbering), on the peptidyl transferase activity of the ribosome. The activities of the in vitro reconstituted mutant subunits, though somewhat reduced, were comparable with those of the subunits assembled with the wild-type 23S rRNA, indicating that A2602 mutations do not abolish the ability of the ribosome to catalyze peptide bond formation. Similar results were obtained with double mutants carrying mutations at A2602 and another universally conserved nucleotide in the peptidyl transferase center, A2451. The obtained results agree with our previous conclusion that the ribosome accelerates peptide bond formation primarily through entropic rather than chemical catalysis.

This work generalizes the reference tissue method to estimate dopamine transporter occupancy for two levels of cocaine administration using only a single injection of [F-18]FECNT. The results are validated by comparison with literature values. Five rhesus monkeys were studied. On each animal, a baseline scan was collected following [F-18]FECNT injection (phase a). At 120 min postinjection, 0.1 mg/kg cocaine was injected and the animal was scanned for 50 additional min (phase b). Then 1.0 mg/kg cocaine was injected and another 50-min scan sequence was collected (phase c). Time-activity curves (encompassing all three phases) were generated for each animal from regions drawn over the putamen and cerebellum. The putamen curve was modeled using the cerebellum as the input function. Percent DAT occupancy following the cocaine injections was determined by comparing k(3)/k(4) = B-max/k(D) for the three phases. The 0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg cocaine doses occupied 53% +/- 5% and 87% +/- 5% of the transporters, respectively. The measured occupancies are consistent with literature values that maintain self-administration in animals and produce a "high" in human subjects. This work demonstrates that a single injection of [F-18]FECNT can be used to measure the effects of multiple cocaine challenges. Two advantages of this technique are: reduced variability in dose-response curves because the subject is his/her own control, and the F-18 label allows evaluation of longer-acting drugs.

Previously, we showed that the third outer loop (E3) is the binding site for NT and its analogs, several of which bind with higher affinity to rat NTR1 (rNTR1) than to human NTR1 (hNTR1). In particular, NT34 {[3,1'-naphthyl-1-Ala(11)]NT(8-13)} has greater than 60-fold higher affinity for rNTR1 (46 and 60 pM for transiently- and stably-transfected cells, respectively) than for hNTR1 (2.8 and 5.8 nM, for transiently- and stably-transfected cells, respectively) isolated from transfected cell membranes. Previously, our molecular modeling studies of rNTR1 and hNTR1 showed that the binding pocket in the human receptor for NT34 is smaller in volume from the bulky residue Tyr(339) in the pocket center, as compared with the corresponding residue Phe(344) in the rat binding pocket. Therefore, with site-directed mutagenesis, we derived mutant forms of rNTR1 (F344Y) and hNTR1 (Y339F). Examination of the mutant receptors from membranal preparations of transfected cells in radioligand binding assays and with intact cells in functional assays (phosphatidyl-4,5-bisphosphate turnover) showed that the human-like rat receptor and the rat-like human receptor bound NT34 with a predicted reverse of binding compared with its binding to the wild-type receptors. These results strongly affirm our molecular modeling studies and demonstrate the importance of the study of even minor structural variations in proteins to determine the basis of significantly different drug responses, an area of focus for pharmacological research in the 21st century.

Herein, we experimentally evaluated mechanisms regulating the surface t(1/2) of various alpha(2A)-adrenergic receptor (alpha(2A)AR) structures. The Delta 3i alpha(2A)AR (lacking the third intracellular loop), D79Na(2A)AR (impaired G protein coupling), and CAM alpha(2A)AR (enhanced G protein coupling) all exhibited a cell surface alpha(2A)AR turnover in Chinese hamster ovary cells that was faster than that of the wild type (WT). Cell surface receptor turnover could be slowed with Ligand occupancy of D79N alpha(2A)AR (agonist or antagonist) and CAM alpha(2A)AR (antagonist only) but not the Delta 3i- or WT alpha(2A)AR. This selective ligand-induced surface stabilization was paralleled by a dramatic Ligand-dependent receptor density upregulation for D79N- and CAM alpha(2A)AR structures. Receptors which exhibited surface turnover and density that could be modulated by ligand (D79N and CAM) also demonstrated structural instability, measured by a loss of radioligand binding capacity in detergent solution over time without parallel changes in receptor protein content. In contrast, the shorter surface t(1/2) Of the Delta 3i alpha(2A)AR, whose cell surface t(1/)2 and steady state density were not altered by ligand occupancy, occurred in the context of a structurally stable receptor in detergent solution. These results demonstrate that changes in receptor structure which alter receptor-G protein coupling (either an increase or decrease) are paralleled by structural instability and ligand-induced surface stabilization. These studies also provide criteria for assessing the structural instability of the alpha(2A)AR that can likely be generalized to all GPCRs.

Although convincing clinical results have already been obtained with both agents, this study was designed to further investigate the required structural elements for improved ligand-receptor interaction for both peptide cores (CPCR4 and iodo CPCR4). To this aim, a series of DOTA-conjugated CPCR4-and iodo CPCR4-based ligands with new linker structures, replacing the AMBA-linker in PentixaFor and PentixaTher, were synthesized and evaluated. Methods: The in vitro investigation of the novel compounds alongside with the reference peptides PentixaFor and PentixaTher encompassed the determination of hCXCR4 and mCXCR4 affinity (IC 50 ) of the respective nat Ga-, nat Lu-, nat Y-and nat Bi-complexes in Jurkat and E mu-myc 1080 cells using [I-125]FC-131 and [I-125]CPCR4.3 as radioligands, respectively, as well as the evaluation of the internalization and externalization kinetics of selected 68 Ga-and 177 Lu-labeled compounds in hCXCR4-transfected Chem-1 cells. Comparative small animal PET imaging studies (1h p.i.) as well as in vivo biodistribution studies (1, 6 and 48h p.i.) were performed in Daudi (human B cell lymphoma) xenograft bearing CB17 SCID mice. Results: Based on the affinity data and cellular uptake studies, [Ga-68/Lu-177]DOTA-r-a-ABA-CPCR4 and [68 Ga/Lu-177]DOTA-r-a-ABA-iodo CPCR4 (with r-a-ABA = D-Arg-D-Ala-4-aminobenzoyl-) were selected for further evaluation. Both analogs show app. 10-fold enhanced hCXCR4 affinity compared to the respective references [68 Ga]PentixaFor and [Lu-177]PentixaTher, four times higher cellular uptake in hCXCR4 expressing cells and improved cellular retention. Unfortunately, the improved in vitro binding and uptake characteristics of [Ga-68]DOTA-r-a-ABA-CPCR4 and-iodo CPCR4 could not be recapitulated in initial PET imaging studies; both compounds showed similar uptake in the Daudi xenografts as [Ga-68]PentixaFor, alongside with higher background accumulation, especially in the kidneys. However, the subsequent biodistribution studies performed for the corresponding Lu-177-labeled analogs revealed a clear superiority of [Lu-177]DOTA-r-a-ABA-CPCR4 and [Lu-177]DOTA-r-a-ABA-iodo CPCR4 over [177 Lu]PentixaTher with respect to tumor uptake (18.3 +/- 3.7 and 17.2 +/- 2.0 %iD/g, respectively, at 1h p.i. vs 12.4 +/- 3.7%iD/g for [Lu-177]PentixaTher) as well as activity retention in tumor up to 48h. Especially for [Lu-177]DOTA-r-a-ABA-CPCR4 with its low background accumulation, tumor/organ ratios at 48h were 2-to 4-fold higher than those obtained for [Lu-177]PentixaTher (except for kidney). Conclusions: The in-depth evaluation of a series of novel CPCR4-and iodo CPCR4 analogs with modified linker structure has yielded reliable structure-activity relationships. It was generally observed that a)AMBA-by-ABA-substitution leads to enhanced ligand internalization, b) the extension of the ABA-linker by two additional amino acids (DOTA-Xaa 2-Xaa 1-ABA-) provides sufficient linker length to minimize the interaction of the [M3+ ]DOTA-chelate with the receptor, and that c) introduction of a cationic side chain (Xaa 2 ) greatly enhances receptor affinity of the constructs, obliterating the necessity for Tyr 1-iodination of the pentapeptide core to maintain high receptor affinity (such as in [Lu-177]PentixaTher). As a result, [Lu-177]DOTA-r-a-ABA-CPCR4 has emerged from this study as a powerful second-generation therapeutic CXCR4 ligand with greatly improved targeting efficiency and tumor retention and will be further evaluated in preclinical and clinical CXCR4-targeted dosimetry and RLT studies.

Plasma pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effects of the 2-benzylbenzimidazole synthetic opioid, isotonitazene, in male rats	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Isotonitazene; Body temperature; NPS; Catalepsy; Mu-opioid receptor; Toxicology; Metabolites; Method validation; Quantitation; Synthetic opioid; Forensic	MORPHINE; SYSTEM; MISUSE	Rationale Isotonitazene is an illicit synthetic opioid associated with many intoxications and fatalities. Recent studies show that isotonitazene is a potent mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist in vitro, but little information is available about its in vivo effects.Objectives The aims of the present study were to investigate the pharmacokinetics of isotonitazene in rats, and relate pharmacokinetic parameters to pharmacodynamic effects.Methods Isotonitazene and its metabolites were identified and quantified by liquid chromatography tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-QQQ-MS). Male Sprague-Dawley rats with jugular catheters and subcutaneous (s.c.) temperature transponders received isotonitazene (3, 10, 30 mu g/kg, s.c.) or its vehicle. Blood samples were drawn at 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min post-injection, and plasma was assayed using LC-QQQ-MS. At each blood draw, body temperature, catalepsy scores, and hot plate latencies were recorded.Results Maximum plasma concentrations of isotonitazene rose in parallel with increasing dose (range 0.2-9.8 ng/mL) and half-life ranged from 23.4 to 63.3 min. The metabolites 4 & PRIME;-hydroxy nitazene and N-desethyl isotonitazene were detected, and plasma concentrations were below the limit of quantitation (0.5 ng/mL) but above the limit of detection (0.1 ng/mL). Isotonitazene produced antinociception (ED50 = 4.22 mu g/kg), catalepsy-like symptoms (ED50 = 8.68 mu g/kg), and hypothermia (only at 30 mu g/kg) that were significantly correlated with concentrations of isotonitazene. Radioligand binding in rat brain tissue revealed that isotonitazene displays nM affinity for MOR (Ki = 15.8 nM), while the N-desethyl metabolite shows even greater affinity (Ki = 2.2 nM).Conclusions In summary, isotonitazene is a potent MOR agonist whose pharmacodynamic effects are related to circulating concentrations of the parent drug. The high potency of isotonitazene portends substantial risk to users who are exposed to the drug.

Methods Muscarinic receptors in the rat bladder and other tissues were examined by a radioligand binding assay using [N-methyl-H-3]scopolamine chloride. The occupancy levels of muscarinic receptors by vibegron in bladders of humans after its oral administration were predicted from the estimation of unbound concentrations in human plasma and urine in the literature. Results Vibegron (0.1-100 mu mol/L) inhibited specific [N-methyl-H-3]scopolamine chloride binding in the bladder and other tissues of rats in a concentration-dependent manner. The 50% inhibitory concentration value of vibegron in the bladder was approximately twofold higher than that in the heart, and approximately 315- and 3.5-fold lower than those in the submaxillary gland and brain, respectively. Therefore, the binding affinity of vibegron for muscarinic receptors was higher in the heart and bladder than in the submaxillary gland and brain. By using the rat bladder receptor binding affinity, occupancy levels of muscarinic receptors in the human bladder were predicted to be 51-91% until 24 h after its oral administration at 50 mg of vibegron. Conclusions This is the first study to suggest that vibegron binds to muscarinic receptors in the rat bladder and other tissues, with a potentially higher affinity for the M-2 subtype than the M-1 and M-3 subtypes. These results might be clinically relevant for pharmacotherapy with vibegron for overactive bladder.

Previous studies have indicated that the effects of Amph at the D2R mainly rely on the ability of Amph to robustly increase extracellular dopamine through the dopamine transporter (DAT). This implies that the effects of Amph on D2R require the neurotransmitter dopamine. However, because of its lipophilic nature, Amph can cross the cellular membrane and thus potentially affect D2R expression independently of dopamine and DAT, e.g., in post-synaptic terminals. Here we used an in vitro system to study whether Amph affects total expression, cellular distribution, and function of the human D2R (hD2R), endogenously expressed in HEK293 cells. By performing Western blot experiments, we found that prolonged treatments with 1 or 50 mu M Amph cause a significant decrease of the endogenous hD2R in cells transfected with human DAT (hDAT). On the other hand, in cells lacking expression of DAT, quantification of the hD2R-mediated changes in cAMP, biotinylation assays, Western blots and imaging experiments demonstrated an increase of hD2R at the cellular membrane after 15-h treatments with Amph. Moreover, imaging data suggested that barbadin, a specific inhibitor of the beta arrestin-beta adaptin interaction, blocked the Amph-induced increase of hD2R. Taken together our data suggest that prolonged exposures to Amph decrease or increase the endogenous hD2R at the cellular membrane in HEK293 cells expressing or lacking hDAT, respectively. Considering that this drug is often consumed for prolonged periods, during which tolerance develops, our data suggest that even in absence of DAT or dopamine, Amph can still alter D2R distribution and function.

The aim of this study is to describe the characteristics of patients with NENs who tested severe acute respiratory syndrome cor-onavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive. Material and methods: This is a worldwide study collecting cases of patients with NENs along with a positive nasopharyngeal swab reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 between June 1, 2020, and March 31, 2021. Centres treating pa-tients with NENs were directly contacted by the principal investigator. Patients with NENs of any primary site, grade and stage were included, excluding small-cell lung carcinoma and mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma. Results: Among 81 centres directly contacted, 88.8% responded and 48.6% of them declined due to lack of cases or interest. On March 31st, 2021, eight recruiting centres enrolled 89 pa-tients. The median age was 64 years at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. Most patients had metastatic, non-functioning, low-/intermediate-grade gastroenteropancreatic NENs on treat-ment with somatostatin analogues and radioligand therapy. Most of them had comorbidities. Only 8% of patients had high-grade NENs and 12% were receiving chemotherapy. Most pa-tients had symptoms or signs of COVID-19, mainly fever and cough. Only 3 patients under-went sub-intensive treatment, whereas most of them received medical therapies, mostly antibiotics. In two third of cases, no changes occurred for the anti-NEN therapy. More than 80% of patients completely recovered without sequelae, whereas 7.8% patients died due to COVID-19. Conclusions: Patients included in this study reflect the typical NEN population regardless of SARS-CoV-2. In most cases, they overcome COVID-19 without need of intensive care, short-term sequelae and discontinuation of systemic oncological therapy. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen expression is also demonstrated in the tumor-associated neovasculature endothelium. Juvenile nasal angiofibroma (JNA), being a similar highly vascular tumor, may also demonstrate significant PSMA expression, which may be utilized for its imaging and treatment. Methods In this prospective study, 25 clinicoradiologically diagnosed primary JNA patients underwent PSMA PET/CT scan. The scan was performed after 45 to 60 minutes of intravenous injection of 2 to 3 mCi (74-111 MBq) of Ga-68-PSMA-HBED-CC on a dedicated PET/CT scanner. Low-dose CT scan was acquired from vertex to sternoclavicular joint (100 mA, 20 kVp, 3-mm slice thickness, 0.8 pitch). Images were reconstructed with iterative reconstruction technique (4 iterations, 24 subsets). The objective was to assess the intensity and pattern of PSMA uptake in primary JNA patients. Results All cases (n = 25) of primary JNA showed PSMA expression in the tumor (100%). The median PSMA SUVmax ratio of tumor to background was 4.57 (range, 2.08-7.27). Intracranial extension in 14 of 25 patients was prominently visualized because of absence of background uptake in the brain. Advanced stage tumors demonstrated greater uptake than early tumors (P = 0.011). A statistically nonsignificant trend was noted for decreasing uptake with increasing age after normalizing for stage (Spearman correlation coefficient r = -0.08). Conclusions Assessment of PSMA expression in JNA by PSMA PET/CT opens up a new window of opportunity with respect to its radiological staging, vascularity assessment, and molecular characterization.

Methods Twenty-two patients already treated with anti-androgens and docetaxel were enrolled for one cycle of Lu-177-PSMA therapy. Haemoglobin, total leukocyte counts, platelets and serum creatinine for toxicity profile while prostate specific antigen (PSA), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, visual analogue scale (VAS) and analgesic quantification scale (AQS) for therapeutic efficacy were recorded pre and 8 weeks post therapy. Wilcoxon signed-rank and ANOVA tests were used for statistical analysis. Results Partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD) for PSA were seen in 5 (22.7%), 13 (59.1%) and 4 (18.2%) patients respectively treated with mean 6.88 GBq dose of Lu-177-PSMA. 8/22 (36.4%) patients showed >= 30% drop in PSA. Grade 3 haemoglobin toxicity was seen in 5/22 (22.7%) patients. No patient developed grade 4 haemoglobin toxicity. No patients had grade 3 or 4 leukocytopenia or thrombocytopenia. Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed statistical significant (P < 0.05) difference in pre and post treatment ECOG, VAS, and AQS scores. The ANOVA test showed statistically significant difference in mean doses of Lu-177-PSMA used in three PSA response groups while difference was non-significant for other variables. Conclusion We concluded that Lu-177-PSMA therapy has adequate pain palliation in end-stage mCRPC patients with low performance status and it has a potential to become effective therapeutic option in properly selected patients.

The association of psychosocial risk factors for mental health with a brain marker altered by inflammation: A translocator protein (TSPO) PET imaging study	BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND IMMUNITY			English	Article						Microglia; Psychosocial risk factors; Depression; Psychosis; Inflammation	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; ADULT PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; VIVO RADIOLIGAND BINDING; 18 KDA TSPO; CHILDHOOD ADVERSITIES; 1ST-EPISODE PSYCHOSIS; MICROGLIA ACTIVATION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; LIFE EVENTS	Psychiatric disorders associated with psychosocial risk factors, including depression and psychosis, have been shown to demonstrate increased microglia activity. Whilst preclinical studies indicate that psychosocial stress leads to increased levels of microglia in the frontal cortex, no study has yet been performed in humans. This study aimed at investigating whether psychosocial risk factors for depression and/or psychosis would be associated with alterations in a brain marker expressed by microglia, the translocator specific protein (TSPO) in humans. We used [11C]-PBR28 Positron Emission Tomography on healthy subjects exposed to childhood and adulthood psychosocial risk factors (high-risk group, N = 12) and age- and sex-matched healthy controls not exposed to childhood and adulthood psychosocial risk factors (low-risk group, N = 12). The [11Q-PBR28 volume of distribution (VT) and Distribution Volume Ratio (DVR) were measured in the total gray matter, and frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital lobes. Levels of childhood trauma, anxiety and depression were measured using respectively the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, State-anxiety questionnaire and Beck Depression Inventory. Compared to the low-risk group, the high-risk group did not exhibit significant differences in the mean [15C]-PBR28 VT (F(1,20) = 1.619, p = 0.218) or DVR (F(1,22) = 0.952, p = 0.340) on any region. There were no significant correlations between the [11Q-PBR28 VT and DVRs in total gray matter and frontal lobe and measures of childhood trauma, anxiety and depression. Psychosocial risk factors for depression and/or psychosis are unlikely to be associated with alterations in [HC]-PBR28 binding, indicating that alterations in TSPO expression reported in these disorders is unlikely to be caused by psychosocial risk factors alone.

Tetrabromobisphenol A-induced depolarization of rat cerebellar granule cells: <i>ex vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> studies	CHEMOSPHERE			English	Article						Neurotoxicity; NMDA receptor; Oxonol VI; Plasma membrane potential; Radioligand binding; Whole-cell current clamp recording	BROMINATED FLAME RETARDANTS; D-ASPARTATE RECEPTOR; GLUTAMATE RELEASE; NMDA; NEUROTOXICITY; RYANODINE; GLYCINE; NEURONS; 6-CYANO-7-NITROQUINOXALINE-2,3-DIONE; CYTOTOXICITY	The brominated flame retardant tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) is toxic to cultured brain neurons, and glutamate receptors partially mediate this effect; consequently, the depolarizing effect of TBBPA on neurons is to be expected, but it is yet to be actually demonstrated. The aim of this study was to detect TBBPA-evoked depolarization and identify the underlying mechanisms. The plasma membrane potential of rat cerebellar granule cells (CGC) in cerebellar slices or in primary cultures was measured using whole cell current clamp recordings, or the fluorescent probe oxonol VI, respectively. The contribution of NMDA and AMPA receptors, voltage-gated sodium channels and intracellular calcium mobilization was tested using their selective antagonists or inhibitors. Direct interactions of TBBPA with NMDARs were tested by measuring the specific binding of radiolabeled NMDAR ligands to isolated rat cortical membrane fraction. TBBPA (25 mu M) strongly depolarized CGC in cerebellar slices, and at >= 7.5 mu M concentration-dependently depolarized primary CGC cultures. Depolarization of the primary CGC by 25 mu M TBBPA was partly reduced when MK-801 was applied alone or in combination with either TTX or CNQX, or where bastadin 12 was applied in combination with ryanodine, whereas depolarization was completely prevented when MK-801, CNQX and TTX where combined. TBBPA had no effect on the specific binding of NMDAR radio-ligands to isolated cortical membranes. These results demonstrate the depolarizing effect of TBBPA on CGC, which is mainly mediated by ionotropic glutamate receptors, while voltage-gated sodium channels are also involved. We found no evidence for the direct activation of NMDARS by TBBPA. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Characterization of insulin and IGF-1 receptor binding in equine liver and lamellar tissue: implications for endocrinopathic laminitis	DOMESTIC ANIMAL ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						Horses; Hyperinsulinemia; IGF-1; Insulin; Laminitis; Receptors	GROWTH-FACTOR-I; NEGATIVE COOPERATIVITY; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; EXPRESSION; HYPERINSULINEMIA; PATHOLOGY	Although it is well established that equine laminitis can be triggered by extreme hyperinsulinemia, the mechanism of insulin action is not known. High concentrations of insulin lead to separation of the weight-bearing apparatus from the hoof wall and are associated with an increased cycle of cell death and proliferation in the lamellae. Gene expression and immunohistochemistry studies have indicated that the lamellae are sparsely populated with insulin receptors, whereas IGF-1 receptors (IGF-1R) are abundant, suggesting that the action of insulin may be mediated by insulin binding to the IGF-1R. To investigate this possibility, cell membrane fragments containing IGF-1R were extracted from the livers of 6 horses and the lamellae of >50 horses euthanized for non-research purposes at an abattoir. Radioligand-binding studies using I-125-IGF-1 and I-125-insulin confirmed an abundance of high-affinity IGF-1R in the liver (K-D 0.11 nM, B-max 223 fmol/mg protein) and lamellae (K-D 0.16 nM, B-max 243 fmol/mg protein). However, the affinity of insulin for binding to the lamellar IGF-1R (K-i 934 nM) was >5,800 fold less than that of IGF-1, suggesting that insulin is unlikely to bind to equine IGF-1R at physiological concentrations. Although insulin receptors could be detected in the liver (K-D 0.48 nM, B-max 123 fmolimg protein), they were barely detectable in lamellae (estimated B-max 14 fmol/mg protein). There was no evidence to support the presence of insulin/IGF-1 hybrid receptors in either tissue. These findings suggest that insulin does not act directly through IGF-1 receptors and that an alternative theory is required to explain the mechanism of insulin action in laminitis.

It is, thus, a promising marker of tumour growth. Aptides are a novel class of peptides with high-affinity binding to specific protein targets. APT(EDB) is an antagonist-like ligand that especially interacts with human fibronectin EDB. Objective: This study was the first attempt in which the hydrazinonicotinamide (HYNIC)-conjugated APT(EDB) was labelled with technetium-99m (Tc-99m) as an appropriate radiotracer and tricine/EDDA exchange labeling. Methods: Radiochemical purity, normal saline, and serum stability were evaluated by HPLC and radio-isotope TLC scanner. Other examinations, such as protein-binding calculation, dissociation radioligand binding assay, and partition coefficient constant determination, were also carried out. The cellular-specific binding of Tc-99m-HYNIC-conjugated APT(EDB) was assessed in two EDB-positive (U87MG) and EDB-negative (U373MG) cell lines. Bio-distribution was investigated in normal mice as well as in U87MG and U373MG tumour-bearing mice. Eventually, the radiolabelled APT(EDB) was used for tumour imaging using planar SPECT. Results: Radiolabelling was achieved with high purity (up to 97%) and accompanied by high solution (over 90% after overnight) and serum (80% after 2 hours) stability. The obtained cellular-specific binding ratio was greater than nine-fold. In-vivo experiments showed rapid blood clearance with mainly renal excretion and tumour uptake specificity (0.48 +/- 0.03% ID/g after 1h). The results of the imaging also confirmed considerable tumour uptake for EDB-positive cell line compared with the EDB-negative one. Conclusion: Aptides are considered to be a potent candidate for biopharmaceutical applications. They can be modified with imaging or therapeutic agents. This report shows the capability of Tc-99m-HYNIC-APT(EDB) for human EDB-expressing tumours detection.

Drug-target residence time is a measure for the lifetime of the drug-target complex, which has recently been receiving considerable interest, as target residence time is shown to have prognostic value for the in vivo efficacy of several drugs. In this study, we have investigated the relation between the increased residence time of antihistamines at the histamine H-1 receptor (H1R) and the duration of effective target-inhibition by these antagonists. Hela cells, endogenously expressing low levels of the H1R, were incubated with a series of antihistamines and dissociation was initiated by washing away the unbound antihistamines. Using a calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye and a label free, dynamic mass redistribution based assay, functional recovery of the H1R responsiveness was measured by stimulating the cells with histamine over time, and the recovery was quantified as the receptor recovery time. Using these assays, we determined that the receptor recovery time for a set of antihistamines differed more than 40-fold and was highly correlated to their H1R residence times, as determined with competitive radioligand binding experiments to the H1R in a cell homogenate. Thus, the receptor recovery time is proposed as a cell-based and physiologically relevant metric for the lead optimization of G protein-coupled receptor antagonists, like the H1R antagonists. Both, label-free or real-time, classical signaling assays allow an efficient and physiologically relevant determination of kinetic properties of drug molecules.

In the locust Locusta migratoria, a model insect species with agricultural importance, the third beta subunits (Loc beta 3) was identified in this study, which reveals at least three beta subunits in this insect species. Imidacloprid was found to bind nAChRs in L. migratoria central nervous system at two sites with different affinities, with K-d values of 0.16 and 10.31 nM. The specific andsera (L1-1, L2-1 and L3-1) were raised against fusion proteins at the large cytoplasmic loop of Loc beta, Loc beta 2 and Loc beta 3 respectively. Specific immunodepletion of Loc beta 1 with antiserum L1-1 resulted in the selective loss of the low affinity binding site for imidacloprid, whereas the immunodepletion of Lo beta 3 with L3-1 caused the selective loss of the high affinity site. Dual immunodepletion with L1-1 and L3-1 could completely abolish imidacloprid binding. In contrast, the immunodepletion of Loc beta 2 had no significant effect on the specific [H-3]imidacloprid binding. Taken together, these data indicated that Loc beta 1 and Loc beta 3 were respectively contained in the low-and high-affinity binding sites for imidacloprid in L. migratoria, which is different to the previous finding in Nilaparvata lugens that NI beta 1 was in two binding sites for imidacloprid. The involvement of two beta subunits separately in two binding sites may decrease the risk of imidacloprid resistance due to putative point mutations in beta subunits in L migratoria.

Recent efforts have been focused on the development of subnanomolar potent, selective MAO-B (N1-alkyl-substituted compounds 12a-14a and 15) and dual active MAO-A/B (N2-methylated compounds 12b-14b) inhibitors with nanomolar potency towards MAO-B and moderately active against MAO-A enzyme, respectively. The most promising drug-like derivatives in both series were N-(3-chloro-4-fluoropheny1)-1-methy1-1Hindazole-5-carboxamide (13a, NTZ-1441, IC50 hMAO-B 0.662 nM, >15000-fold selective versus MAO-A) and N-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-2-methyl-2H-indazole-5-carboxamide (13b, NTZ-1442, IC50 hMAO-B 8.08 nM, IC50 hMAO-A 0.56 mu M, SI = 70). Moreover, compounds 13a and 13b were predicted to cross both the gastrointestinal tract (at pH 2.0, 5.5, and 7,4) and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in vitro with appropriate drug-like properties required for CNS active drugs. Combined single X-ray/molecular modeling studies provided insights into the enzyme inhibitor interactions within both MAO isoforms and the rationale for their inhibitory activity with controlled MAO-A/B selectivity despite their small structural differences. The binding modes of 12a,b and 13a,b confirmed that the major interactions with hMAO-B were established via the flexible carbonyl group of the carboxamide linkage and the electron donating nitrogens N1 or N2 of the indazole moiety, allowing further exploration of the alkyl side chain for next step lead optimization efforts.

Here we describe evidence that high levels of resistance to spinosad in the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) are associated with a three amino acid (3-aa) deletion in the fourth transmembrane domain (TM4) of the nAChR alpha 6 subunit (Px alpha 6). Following laboratory selection with spinosad, the SZ-SpinR strain of P. xylostella exhibited 940-fold resistance to spinosad. In addition, the selected insect population had 1060-fold cross-resistance to spinetoram but, in contrast, no cross resistance to abamectin was observed. Genetic analysis indicates that spinosad resistance in SZ-SpinR is inherited as a recessive and autosomal trait, and that the 3-aa deletion (IIA) in TM4 of Px alpha 6 is tightly linked to spinosad resistance. Because of well-established difficulties in functional expression of cloned insect nAChRs, the analogous resistance-associated deletion mutation was introduced into a prototype nAChR (the cloned human alpha 7 subunit). Two-electrode voltage-clamp recording with wild-type and mutated nAChRs expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes indicated that the mutation causes a complete loss of agonist activation. In addition, radioligand binding studies indicated that the 3-aa deletion resulted in significantly lower-affinity binding of the extracellular neurotransmitter-binding site. These findings are consistent with the 3-amino acid (IIA) deletion within the transmembrane domain of Px alpha 6 being responsible for target-site resistance to spinosad in the SZ-SpinR strain of P. xylostella.

Dietary supplement for energy and reduced appetite containing the β-agonist isopropyloctopamine leads to heart problems and hospitalisations	FOOD ADDITIVES AND CONTAMINANTS PART A-CHEMISTRY ANALYSIS CONTROL EXPOSURE & RISK ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Biosensor; internet; enforcement; health risks; supplements; web shops	TANDEM MASS-SPECTROMETRY; LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY; BIOASSAY; VALIDATION; FEED; IDENTIFICATION; STEROIDS	In 2013 the Dutch authorities issued a warning against a dietary supplement that was linked to 11 reported adverse reactions, including heart problems and in one case even a cardiac arrest. In the UK a 20-year-old woman, said to have overdosed on this supplement, died. Since according to the label the product was a herbal mixture, initial LC-MS/MS analysis focused on the detection of plant toxins. Yohimbe alkaloids, which are not allowed to be present in herbal preparations according to Dutch legislation, were found at relatively high levels (400-900 mg kg(-1)). However, their presence did not explain the adverse health effects reported. Based on these effects the supplement was screened for the presence of a beta-agonist, using three different biosensor assays, i.e. the validated competitive radioligand beta 2-adrenergic receptor binding assay, a validated beta-agonists ELISA and a newly developed multiplex microsphere (bead)-based beta-agonist assay with imaging detection (MAGPIX (R)). The high responses obtained in these three biosensors suggested strongly the presence of a beta-agonist. Inspection of the label indicated the presence of N-isopropyloctopamine. A pure standard of this compound was bought and shown to have a strong activity in the three biosensor assays. Analysis by LC-full-scan high-resolution MS confirmed the presence of this 'unknown known' beta 3-agonist N-isopropyloctopamine, reported to lead to heart problems at high doses. A confirmatory quantitative analysis revealed that one dose of the preparation resulted in an intake of 40-60 mg, which is within the therapeutic range of this compound. The case shows the strength of combining bioassays with chemical analytical techniques for identification of illegal pharmacologically active substances in food supplements.	[Bovee, Toine F.

Previous molecular imaging studies have shown associations between striatal dopamine (DA) D2-receptor binding and interpersonal traits, such as social conformity. The objective of this study was to explore, for the first time, the role of DA D1-receptors (D1-Rs) in human interpersonal behavior. Twenty-three healthy subjects were examined using positron emission tomography and the radioligand [C-11] SCH23390, yielding D1-R binding potential values. Striatal D1-R binding was related to personality scales selected to specifically assess one dimension of interpersonal behavior, namely a combination of affiliation and dominance (i.e., the Social Desirability, Verbal Trait Aggression and Physical Trait Aggression scales from Swedish Universities Scales of Personality). An exploratory analysis was also performed for extrastriatal brain regions. D1-R binding potential values in the limbic striatum(r= .52; p= .015), associative striatum(r= .55; p= .009), and sensorimotor striatum(r= .67; p= .001) were positively related to Social Desirability scores. D1-R binding potential in the limbic striatum (r= -.51; p = .019) was negatively associated with Physical Trait Aggression scores. For extrastriatal regions, Social Desirability scores showed positive correlations in the amygdala (r = .60; p = .006) and medial frontal cortex (r= .60; p = .004). This study provides further support for the role of DA function in the expression of disaffiliative and dominant traits. Specifically, D1-R availability may serve as a marker for interpersonal behavior in humans. Associations were demonstrated for the same dimension of interpersonal behavior as for D2-R, but in the opposite direction, suggesting that the two receptor subtypes are involved in the same behavioral processes, but with different functional roles.

Manifold factors influencing the density of this receptor have been identified, e.g., steroid hormones, sunlight exposure and genetic variants of serotonin-related genes. Given the close interactions between serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission, we investigated whether a common single-nucleotide-polymorphism of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene (VAL158MET or rs4680) coding for a key enzyme of the dopamine network that is associated with the pathogenesis of mood disorders and antidepressant treatment response, directly affects 5-HT1A receptor binding potential. Fifty-two healthy individuals (38 female, mean age +/- A standard deviation = 40.48 +/- A 14.87) were measured via positron emission tomography using the radioligand [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635. Genotyping for rs4680 was performed using DNA isolated from whole blood with the MassARRAY platform of the software SEQUENOM(A (R)). Whole brain voxel-wise ANOVA resulted in a main effect of genotype on 5-HT1A binding. Compared to A carriers (AA + AG) of rs4680, homozygote G subjects showed higher 5-HT1A binding potential in the posterior cingulate cortex (F ((2,49)) = 17.7, p = 0.05, FWE corrected), the orbitofrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, the insula, the amygdala and the hippocampus (voxel-level: p < 0.01 uncorrected, t > 2.4; cluster-level: p < 0.05 FWE corrected). In light of the frequently reported alterations of 5-HT1A binding in anxiety and mood disorders, this study proposes a potential implication of the COMT genotype, more specifically the VAL158MET polymorphism, via modulation of the serotonergic neurotransmission.

We sought to unravel how a plant-original compound, ginsenoside Rh1, potentiates dexmethasone (DEX)'s potential anti-inflammation properties. Methods: Ginsenoside Rh1 combined with DEX was applied in a short-term and long-term treatment protocol for inflammation. Its potential mechanism on anti-inflammation was explored. In addition, the effect of Rh1 on the side-effect induced by DEX was studied. Furthermore, the in vivo anti-inflammatory effects of Rh1 combined with DEX were evaluated in a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice model. Results: Ginsenoside Rh1 potentiates DEX's anti-inflammatory effects even after prolonged DEX treatment. Rh1 could improve the glucocorticoid receptor (GR)'s transrepression on nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) and transactivation on dual specificity protein phosphatase 1 (DUSP1), which is responsible for DEX's anti-inflammatory effects. Parallel Western blot assay and radioligand binding analysis revealed that Rh1 could increase the expression and binding of GR. This is in sharp contrast to DEX alone, showing a direct link among prolonged treatment, decreasing GR and the abolishment of anti-inflammation. Interestingly, Rh1 does not enhance the transactivation of glucocorticoid-responsive elements (GRE) driven genes - gluconeogenic enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase (G6P) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinasee phosphatase (PEPCK) in primary mouse hepatocytes, a mechanism partly held accountable for the metabolic side-effects. Similar results were found in CIA mice. Conclusion: Rh1 could potentiate DEX's anti-inflammatory effects and does not cause a hyperglycemic side effect. Ginsenoside Rh1 combined with DEX may be a promising candidate treatment option for chronic inflammatory diseases in need of long-term immunosuppression therapies.

Gender-specific abnormalities in the serotonin transporter system in panic disorder	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Cingulate cortex; [C-11]DASB; insula; positron emission tomography; 5-HTT	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; RECEPTOR-BINDING; REUPTAKE INHIBITORS; ANXIETY SENSITIVITY; SEX-DIFFERENCES; BRAIN; ATTACKS; OCCUPANCY; 5-HYDROXYTRYPTOPHAN	The central serotonergic system has been implicated in the pathophysiology of panic disorder (PD) by evidence of abnormally elevated serotonin-turnover, reduced pre- and post-synaptic 5-HT(1A-)receptor sensitivity and binding and clinical improvement during administration of agents that enhance serotonergic transmission. Polymorphisms in genes that putatively influence serotonergic neurotransmission increase the vulnerability for developing PD specifically in males. We tested the hypotheses that serotonin transporter (5-HTT) binding is elevated in PD subjects vs. healthy controls in regions where in vivo evidence exists for both elevated 5-HTT and 5-HT1A receptor levels in PD and investigated whether the extent of this difference depends upon gender. Volunteers were out-patients with current PD (n=24) and healthy controls (n=24). The non-displaceable component of 5-HTT binding-potential (BPND) was measured using positron emission tomography and the 5-HTT selective radioligand, [C-11]DASB. PD severity was assessed using the PD Severity Scale. The 5-HTT-BPND was increased in males with PD relative to male controls in the anterior cingulate cortex (F=8.96, p(FDR)=0.01) and midbrain (F=5.09, p(FDR)=0.03). In contrast, BPND did not differ between females with PD and female controls in any region examined. The finding that 5-HTT-binding is elevated in males but not in females with PD converges with other evidence suggesting that dysfunction within the central serotonergic system exists in PD, and also indicates that such abnormalities are influenced by gender. These findings conceivably may reflect a sexual dimorphism that underlies the greater efficacy of serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment in females vs. males with PD.

J	Gasparre, G; Abate, C; Berardi, F; Cassano, G				Gasparre, Giuseppe; Abate, Carmen; Berardi, Francesco; Cassano, Giuseppe			The sigma-1 receptor antagonist PB212 reduces the Ca<SUP>2+</SUP>-release through the inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate receptor in SK-N-SH cells	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Endoplasmic reticulum; Mitochondria; Neuromodulation; Receptor; Tumor	GUINEA-PIG BRAIN; OPERATED CALCIUM-ENTRY; SH-SY5Y CELLS; LIGANDS; BINDING; LINES; MODULATION; MECHANISM; STORE; SIGMA(1)-RECEPTORS	Sigma-1 receptors are specifically located at the endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondrion interface, but upon stimulation by ligands or under prolonged cellular stress, they translocate to other areas of the cell. Sigma-1 receptors are involved in the regulation of intracellular [Ca2+] by affecting the Ca2+-influx or the release from intracellular stores. In SK-N-SH cells, we measured the affinity of 4-methyl-1-[4-(6-methoxynaphthalen-1-yl)butyl]piperidine (PB212) at sigma-1 receptor by using a competition binding assay with specific radioligand; we obtained a K-i value = 316 +/- 19 nM. PB212 also showed an antiproliferative effect in SK-N-SH cells (EC50 = 32 +/- 4 mu M) but had no effect in MCF7 cells, which only express sigma-2 receptor; these findings suggest that PB212 behaves as a sigma-1 receptor antagonist. We have studied the effect of PB212 on Ca2+ homeostasis of the SK-N-SH cell line with the fluorescent probe Fura-2. 100 mu M PB212 induced a Ca2+-efflux from the endoplasmic reticulum through the inositol (1, 4, 5)-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor. Moreover, [PB212] ranging from 1 to 100 mu M reduced the Ca2+-response, triggered by carbachol or bradykinin that engage the phospholipase C/IP3 pathway; such a response is generally increased by sigma-1 receptor agonists. On the other hand, PB212 did not reduce the Ca2+-response mediated by IP3 in LoVo cells, which do not express neither sigma-1 nor sigma-2 receptors, and in MCF7 cells. The fact that the activity of the sigma-1 receptor can be experimentally modulated by agonists and antagonists supports the intriguing hypothesis that some endogenous molecules, unknown at the moment, modulate the sigma-1 receptor and its cellular targets.

Therefore, the FR is a promising target for imaging and therapy of cancer and inflammation using folate-based radiopharmaceuticals. Herein, we report the synthesis and evaluation of a novel folic acid conjugate with improved properties suitable for positron emission tomography (PET). [F-18]-fluoro-deoxy-glucose folate ([F-18]3) was synthesized based on the click chemistry approach using 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoroglucopyranosyl azide and a folate alkyne derivative. The novel radiotracer [F-18]3 was produced in good radiochemical yields (25% d.c.) and high specific radioactivity (90 GBq/mu mol). Compared to previously published F-18-folic acid derivatives, an increase in hydrophilicity was achieved by using a glucose entity as a prosthetic group. Biodistribution and PET imaging studies in KB tumor-bearing mice showed a high and specific uptake of the radiotracer in FR-positive tumors (10.03 +/- 1.12%ID/g, 60 min p.i.) and kidneys (42.94 +/- 2.04%ID/g, 60 min p.i.). FR-unspecific accumulation of radioactivity was only found in the liver (9.49 +/- 1.13%ID/g, 60 min p.i.) and gallbladder (17.59 +/- 7.22%ID/g, 60 min p.i.). No radiometabolites were detected in blood, urine, and liver tissue up to 30 min after injection of [F-18]3.[F-18]-fluoro-deoxy-glucose-folate [F-18]3 is thus a promising PET radioligand for imaging FR-positive tumors.

Putative role of the adenosine A<sub>3</sub> receptor in the antiproliferative action of N <SUP>6</SUP>-(2-isopentenyl)adenosine	PURINERGIC SIGNALLING			English	Article						Adenosine A(3) receptor; N-6-(2-isopentenyl) adenosine (IPA); Antitumor agent; Modified nucleoside; HPLC; Zeatin riboside	CANCER CELL-PROLIFERATION; HAMSTER OVARY CELLS; CL-IB-MECA; MOLECULAR-CLONING; GROWTH; TUMOR; CYTOKININS; AGONIST; N6-(DELTA2-ISOPENTENYL)ADENOSINE; PHOSPHORYLATION	We tested a panel of naturally occurring nucleosides for their affinity towards adenosine receptors. Both N (6)-(2-isopentenyl)adenosine (IPA) and racemic zeatin riboside were shown to be selective human adenosine A(3) receptor (hA(3)R) ligands with affinities in the high nanomolar range (K (i) values of 159 and 649 nM, respectively). These values were comparable to the observed K (i) value of adenosine on hA(3)R, which was 847 nM in the same radioligand binding assay. IPA also bound with micromolar affinity to the rat A(3)R. In a functional assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with hA(3)R, IPA and zeatin riboside inhibited forskolin-induced cAMP formation at micromolar potencies. The effect of IPA could be blocked by the A(3)R antagonist VUF5574. Both IPA and reference A(3)R agonist 2-chloro-N (6)-(3-iodobenzyl)adenosine-5'-N-methylcarboxamide (Cl-IB-MECA) have known antitumor effects. We demonstrated strong and highly similar antiproliferative effects of IPA and Cl-IB-MECA on human and rat tumor cell lines LNCaP and N1S1. Importantly, the antiproliferative effect of low concentrations of IPA on LNCaP cells could be fully blocked by the selective A(3)R antagonist MRS1523. At higher concentrations, IPA appeared to inhibit cell growth by an A(3)R-independent mechanism, as was previously reported for other A(3)R agonists. We used HPLC to investigate the presence of endogenous IPA in rat muscle tissue, but we could not detect the compound. In conclusion, the antiproliferative effects of the naturally occurring nucleoside IPA are at least in part mediated by the A(3)R.

Lu AE58054, a 5-HT<sub>6</sub> antagonist, reverses cognitive impairment induced by subchronic phencyclidine in a novel object recognition test in rats	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Cognition; in-vivo binding; Lu AE58054; novel object recognition; 5-HT6 receptor antagonist	RECEPTOR MESSENGER-RNA; SEROTONIN RECEPTOR; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; ATYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS; PREPULSE INHIBITION; WATER MAZE; RO 04-6790; DEFICITS; BINDING; BRAIN	The in-vitro potency and selectivity, in-vivo binding affinity and effect of the 5-HT6R antagonist Lu AE58054 ([2-(6-fluoro-1H-indol-3-yl)-ethyl]-[3-(2,2,3,3-tetrafluoropropoxy)-benzyl]-amine) on impaired cognition were evaluated. Lu AE58054 displayed high affinity to the human 5-HT6 receptor (5-HT6R) with a K-i of 0.83 nM. In a 5-HT6 GTP gamma S efficacy assay Lu AE58054 showed no agonist activity, but demonstrated potent inhibition of 5-HT-mediated activation. Besides medium affinity to adrenergic alpha(1A)- and alpha(1B)-adrenoreceptors, Lu AE58054 demonstrated >50-fold selectivity for more than 70 targets examined. Orally administered Lu AE58054 potently inhibited striatal in-vivo binding of the 5-HT6 antagonist radioligand [H-3] Lu AE60157 ([3H]8-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-3-phenylsulfonylquinoline), with an ED50 of 2.7 mg/kg. Steady-state modelling of an acute pharmacokinetic/5-HT6R occupancy time-course experiment indicated a plasma EC50 value of 20 ng/ml. Administration of Lu AE58054 in a dose range (5-20 mg/kg p.o.) leading to above 65% striatal 5-HT6R binding occupancy in vivo, reversed cognitive impairment in a rat novel object recognition task induced after subchronic treatment for 7 d with phencyclidine (PCP 2 mg/kg b.i.d., i.p. for 7 d, followed by 7 d drug free). The results indicate that Lu AE58054 is a selective antagonist of 5-HT(6)Rs with good oral bioavailability and robust efficacy in a rat model of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. Lu AE58054 may be useful for the pharmacotherapy of cognitive dysfunction in disease states such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease.

The objective of the study is to evaluate the cognitive effects of a novel GABA(A) alpha 5 receptor inverse agonist, RO4938581 in rats and monkeys. The in vitro profile was determined using radioligand binding and electrophysiological assays for the GABA(A) alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, and alpha 5 receptors. Long-term potentiation (LTP) was performed in mouse hippocampal slices. Cognitive effects were assessed in rats in the delayed match to position (DMTP) task and the Morris water maze. In monkeys, the object retrieval task was used. Pro-convulsant and anxiogenic potentials were evaluated in mice and rats. In vivo receptor occupancy was determined using [H-3]-RO0154513. RO4938581 is a potent inverse agonist at the GABA(A) alpha 5 receptor, with both binding and functional selectivity, enhancing hippocampal LTP. RO4938581 reversed scopolamine-induced working memory impairment in the DMTP task (0.3-1 mg/kg p.o.) and diazepam-induced spatial learning impairment (1-10 mg/kg p.o.). RO4938581 improved executive function in monkeys (3-10 mg/kg p.o.). Importantly, RO4938581 showed no anxiogenic and pro-convulsive potential. RO4938581 dose-dependently bound to GABA(A) alpha 5 receptors and approximately 30% receptor occupancy was sufficient to produce enhanced cognition in the rat. The data further support the potential of GABA(A) alpha 5 receptors as a target for cognition-enhancing drugs. The dual binding and functional selectivity offers an ideal profile for cognition-enhancing effects without the unwanted side effects associated with activity at other GABA(A) receptor subtypes.

We have also showed that mutation of negatively charged aspartic acid to neutral charged alanine exhibited constitutive activity of beta(1)-AR. However, the mutation of negatively charged aspartic acid to positively charged lysine is still remained to be examined, which is very important to know for fully understanding the characteristics of beta(1)-AR. At the present study, we mutated aspartic acid to lysine (Asp104Lys) residue in human beta(1)-AR. This resultant mutant (Asp104Lys) markedly reduced the binding affinity of isoproterenol and (-)-epinephrine. On the other hand, antagonist binding with this mutant was similar to the wild type receptor. Isoproterenol at its saturation concentrations produced lower amount of intracellular cyclic adenosine-3',5' cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) in HEK-293 cells expressing Asp104Lys mutant receptor as compared to cells expressing wild type receptor. Moreover, cAMP accumulation of Asp104Lys mutant was unchanged in the presence or absence of isoproterenol. Therefore, it has been demonstrated that Asp104Lvs mutation in the human beta(1)-AR differentially affects the binding of antagonist and exhibits a functional uncoupling of G-protein-coupled receptors. Thus, we may suggest that mutation of negatively charged aspartic acid to positively charged lysine as well as neutral charged alanine may help to understand the mechanism of the activation or inactivation of beta(1)-AR by its conformational changes and this finding would be helpful for clarifying the functional responses mediated by beta(1)-AR.

These compounds possessed structural properties similar to those of alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists. In the present study, the affinities of the 2-methoxyphenylpiperazine derivatives (1a-3a) for alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-adrenoceptors were evaluated using radioligand ([H-3] prazosin, [H-3] clonidine) binding assays. In the next step, a new series of phenylpiperazine derivatives of phenytoin (4a-16a) containing 2-methoxyphenyl-, 2-ethoxyphenyl-, 2-pyridyl- or 2-furoylpiperazine moiety, as well as, various ester or alkyl substituents at 3-position of hydantoin ring were synthesized. The newly synthesized compounds were tested for their affinity to alpha 1- and alpha(2)-adrenoceptors. They have shown affinities for alpha(1)-adrenoceptors at nanomolar to submicromolar range. Some compounds were moderately selective ligands of alpha(1)-adrenoceptors. Selected compounds (3a-5a, 7a, 13a, 14a) were also evaluated for their alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonistic properties in functional bioassays. A SAR study indicated that the most active compounds contain 2-alkoxyphenylpiperazine moieties and methyl or 2-methylpropionate substituent at 3-N position in hydantoin. The exchange of 2-alkoxyphenyl moiety into 2-furoyl or 2-pyridyl group significantly decreased affinities for alpha(1)-adrenoceptors. Molecular modelling results obtained using conformational analysis CONFLEX and PM5 method for geometry optimization, allowed for comparison of the spatial properties of tested compounds with pharmacophore model created by Barbaro et al. for the ideal alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist.

Modulation of group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR2/3) in the basal ganglia, a brain region critically involved in motor control, is considered as an alternative approach in therapy of PD. In this study, receptor binding autoradiography of [H-3]LY341495, a mGluR2/3 selective radioligand, was used to investigate possible changes in mGluR2/3 in the basal ganglia of L-Dopa-treated 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) monkeys having developed LIDs compared to animals in which LIDs were prevented by adjunct treatments with CI-1041, a selective antagonist of the NR1A/2B subtype of NMDA receptor, or low doses of the dopamine D2 receptor agonist, cabergoline. Our study is the first to provide evidence of: (1) the similar localization of [H-3]LY341495 specific binding to mGluR2/3 in the primate basal ganglia as compared to receptor distribution measured by immunohistochemistry in human and rat as well as this ligand binding in intact rat brain; (2) no change of [3H]LY341495 specific binding in basal ganglia after nigrostriatal denervation by MPTP; and (3) a widespread reduction of [H-3]LY341495 specific binding to mGluR2/3 in the caudate nucleus (-17% to -31%), putamen (-12% to -45%) and globus pallidus (-56 to -59%) of non-dyskinetic animals treated with L-Dopa + cabergoline as compared to controls, MPTP monkeys treated with saline, L-Dopa alone (dyskinetic) or L-Dopa + CI-1041 (non-dyskinetic). This study is the first to propose a close interaction between mGluR2/3 and dopamine D2 receptors activation in the basal ganglia. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The ligand kinetics was modeled by the usual nonlinear compartment model composed of three compartments (arterial plasma, free and specifically bound ligand in tissue). Arterial blood samples were collected to generate a metabolite-corrected plasma input function. The experimental protocol, which consisted of three injections of labeled or unlabeled ligand, was aiming at identifying all parameters in one experiment. Various parameters, including B'(max) (the binding sites density) and KdVR (the apparent in vivo affinity of 2-[F-18]fluoro-A-85380) could then be estimated in thalamus and in several receptor-poor regions. B'(max) estimate was 3.0 +/- 0.3 pmol/mL in thalamus, and ranged from 0.25 to 1.58 pmol/mL in extrathalamic regions. Although KdVR could be precisely estimated, the association and dissociation rate constants k(on)/V-R and k(off) could not be identified separately. A second protocol was then used to estimate k(off) more precisely in the thalamus. Having estimated all model parameters, we performed simulations of 2-[F-18]fluoro-A-85380 kinetics to test equilibrium hypotheses underlying simplified approaches. These showed that a pseudo-equilibrium is quickly reached between the free and bound compartments, a favorable situation to apply Logan graphical analysis. In contrast, the pseudo-equilibrium between the plasma and free compartments is only reached after several hours. The ratio of radioligand concentration in these two compartments then overestimates the true equilibrium value, an unfavorable situation to estimate distribution volumes from late images after a bolus injection.

Radioligand binding assays, real-time reverser transcription/ polymerase chain reaction with an optional actinomycin D treatment period, and NF-kappa B immunofluorescence were primarily employed in these primary cell cultures. Various stimulatory compounds that increase receptor mRNA stability only ( human and bovine sera, cycloheximide) or that stimulate NF-kappa B nuclear translocation and both mRNA concentration and stability [ interleukin (IL)-1 beta, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)] all increased the density of binding sites for the tritiated B 1 receptor agonist [H-3] Lys-des-Arg(9)-bradykinin (without change in receptor affinity) in cell-based assays. Small interfering RNA assays indicated that NF-kappa B p65 is necessary for the effective expression of the cell surface B 1 receptor under basal or IL-1 beta, fetal bovine serum (FBS), or PMA stimulation conditions. Dexamethasone cotreatment reproduced these effects. IL-1 beta-, FBS-, or PMA-induced stabilization of B-1 receptor mRNA was inhibited by the addition of the protein kinase C inhibitor 3-[1-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-1H-indol-3-yl]-4-(1H-indol-3-yl)-1H-pyrrole-2, 5-dione monohydrochloride (GF-109203x), which also diminished the B-max under FBS or PMA treatment. Lys-des-Arg(9)-bradykinin had little effect on NF-kappa B activation, the B-max, or receptor mRNA abundance or stability. Both NF-kappa B and protein kinase C signaling are required for the effective expression of the kinin B-1 receptor in human umbilical artery smooth muscle cells.

Validation of a tracer kinetic model for the quantification of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors in human brain with [<SUP>11</SUP>C]MDL 100,907	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						[11C]MDL 100,907; 5-HT2A receptors; human brain; mirtazapine; positron emission tomography; tracer kinetic modelling	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; INJECTION PET DATA; F-18 ALTANSERIN; RADIOLABELED METABOLITES; MESSENGER-RNA; RAT-BRAIN; SEROTONIN; BINDING; RADIOLIGAND; LIGAND	The positron emission tomography ( PET) ligand [C-11] MDL 100,907 has previously been introduced to image the serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptor in human brain. The aim of this work was to contribute to the verification of the tracer kinetic modelling in human studies. Five healthy volunteers were scanned twice after intravenous bolus injection of approximately 370MBq [C-11] MDL 100,907 using dynamic PET. One scan was performed under baseline condition, the other scan commenced 90 mins after a single oral dose of 30mg of the antidepressant mirtazapine, which binds to the 5-HT2A receptor. There did not appear to be radiolabelled metabolites of [C-11] MDL 100,907 in human plasma, which are likely to cross the blood - brain barrier. Total volumes of distribution VD in 11 different brain regions were estimated using a reversible, two tissue, four rate constants compartment model with a variable fractional blood volume term and the metabolite- corrected plasma input function. There were no significant changes of the VD in the cerebellum between the baseline and the blocked scans confirming the cerebellum as a region devoid of displaceable binding. Regional estimates of binding potential were then obtained indirectly using the cerebellar VD and occupancies calculated. The mean occupancy with this clinically effective dose of mirtazapine was 60% without significant regional differences. This study confirmed the use of an arterial input kinetic model for the quantification of 5- HT2A receptor binding with [C-11] MDL 100,907 and the use of the cerebellum as a reference region for the free and nonspecific binding.

The most populated (major, NK-IM) binding site binds substance P (SP) and is related to the adenylyl cyclase pathway. The less populated (minor, NK-1m) binding site binds substance P, C-terminal hexa- and heptapeptide analogues of SP, and the NK-2 endogenous ligand, neurokinin A, and is coupled to the phospholipase C pathway. Here, we have examined these two binding sites with plasmon-waveguide resonance (PWR) spectroscopy that allows the thermodynamics and kinetics of ligand-receptor binding processes and the accompanying structural changes of the receptor to be monitored, through measurements of the anisotropic optical properties of lipid bilayers into which the receptor is incorporated. The binding of the three peptides, substance P, neurokinin A, and propionyl [Met(O-2)(11)]SP(7-11), to the partially purified NK-1 receptor has been analyzed by this method. Substance P and neurokinin A bind to the reconstituted receptor in a biphasic manner with two affinities (K-dl = 0.14 +/- 0.02 nM and K-d2 = 1.4 +/- 0.18 nM, and K-dl = 5.5 +/- 0.7 nM and K-d2 = 620 +/- 117 nM, respectively), whereas only one binding affinity (K-d = 5.5 +/- 0.4 nM) could be observed for propionyl[Met(O-2)(II)]SP(7-11). Moreover, binding experiments in which one ligand was added after another one has been bound to the receptor have shown that the binding of these ligands to each binding site was unaffected by the fact that the other site was already occupied. These data strongly suggestthat these two binding sites are independent and non-interconvertible on the time scale of these experiments (1-2 h).

In competitive inhibition studies, (-)-o-methylvesamicol [(-)-OMV] (13) (K-i = 6.7 nM), as well as (-)-vesamicol (K-i = 4.4 nM), had a high affinity for VAChT. (+)-p-Methylvesamicol [(+)-PMV] (16) (K-i = 3.0 nM), as well as SA4503 (K-i = 4.4 nM), reported as a sigma-1 mapping agent for positron emission tomography (PET), had a high affinity for the sigma-1 receptor. The binding affinity of (+)-PMV (1-16) for the sigma-1 receptor (K-i = 3.0 nM) was about 13 times higher than that for the sigma-2 (sigma-2) receptor (K-i = 40.7 nM). (+)-PMV (16) (K-i = 199 nM) had a much lower affinity for VAChT than SA4503 (K-i = 50.2 nM) and haloperidol (K-i = 41.4 nM). These results showed that the binding characteristics of (-)-OMV (13) to VAChT were similar to those of (-)-vesamicol and that (+)-PMV (16) bound to the sigma-1 receptor with high affinity. In conclusion, (-)-OMV (13) and (+)-PMV (16). which had a Suitable structure, with a methyl group for labeling with C-11, may become not only a new VAChT ligand and a new type of sigma receptor ligand, respectively, but may also become a new target compound of VAChT and the sigma-1 receptor radioligand for PET, respectively.

J	Wang, MH; Yao, Y; Kuang, DH; Hampson, DR				Wang, MH; Yao, Y; Kuang, DH; Hampson, DR			Activation of family C G-protein-coupled receptors by the tripeptide glutathione	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							CALCIUM-SENSING RECEPTOR; BINDING POCKET; CA2+; POTENTIATION; CLONING; DOMAIN; HYDRA	The Family C G-protein-coupled receptors include the metabotropic glutamate receptors, the gamma-aminobutyric acid, type B (GABA(B)) receptor, the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), which participates in the regulation of calcium homeostasis in the body, and a diverse group of sensory receptors that encompass the amino acid-activated fish 5.24 chemosensory receptor, the mammalian T1R taste receptors, and the V2R pheromone receptors. A common feature of Family C receptors is the presence of an amino acid binding site. In this study, a preliminary in silico analysis of the size and shape of the amino acid binding pocket in selected Family C receptors suggested that some members of this family could accommodate larger ligands such as peptides. Subsequent screening and docking experiments identified GSH as a potential ligand or co-ligand at the fish 5.24 receptor and the rat CaSR. These in silico predictions were confirmed using an [H-3] GSH radioligand binding assay and a fluorescence-based functional assay performed on wildtype and chimeric receptors. Glutathione was shown to act as an orthosteric agonist at the 5.24 receptor and as a potent enhancer of calcium-induced activation of the CaSR. Within the mammalian receptors, this effect was specific to the CaSR because GSH neither directly activated nor potentiated other Family C receptors including GPRC6A (the putative mammalian homolog of the fish 5.24 receptor), the metabotropic glutamate receptors, or the GABA(B) receptor. Our findings reveal a potential new role for GSH and suggest that this peptide may act as an endogenous modulator of the CaSR in the parathyroid gland where this receptor is known to control the release of parathyroid hormone, and in other tissues such as the brain and gastrointestinal tract where the role of the calcium receptor appears to subserve other, as yet unknown, physiological functions.

Within the styrylamidine subclass, (E)-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)-3-phenylacrylamidine (1), displayed the highest affinity (Ki = 0.7 nM versus [H-3]ifenprodil) and was considered an appropriate candidate for isotopic labelling with carbon-11 (T-1/2: 20.38 min) at its methoxy group for imaging of NMDA receptors with PET. Derivative I has been labelled from the corresponding nor-analogue using [C-11]methyl triflate and the following experimental conditions : (1) trapping at -10 degrees C of [C-11]methyl triflate in 300 mu L of acetone containing 0.6-0.8mg of precursor 5 (2.4-3.2 mu mol) and 5 mu L of a 3M solution of NaOH in water (about 5 eq.); (2) concentration to dryness of the reaction mixture (at 110 degrees C, using a helium stream for 1-2 min); (3) taking up the residue with 0.5 mL of the HPLC mobile phase and (4) purification using semi-preparative HPLC (SymmetryPrep (R) G 18, Waters, 300 x 7.8 mm). Typically, starting from a 1.5 Ci (55.5 GBq) [C-11]CO2 production batch, 120-240 m Ci (4.44-8.88 GBq) of [C-11]-1 (20-40% decay-corrected radiochemical yield, n = 5) was obtained within a total synthesis time of 25-30 min. Specific radioactivities ranged from 0.8 to 1.2 Ci/mu mol (29.6-44.4 GBq/mu mol) at the end of radiosynthesis. No attempts were made to further optimise these reactions, as sufficient material was obtained to allow for preliminary pharmacological characterisation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The objective of the present work was to investigate the acute and chronic effects of clorazepate (CRZ) alone or in combination with BPN on selective K opiate tritiated ligand [H-3]-U69 593 and delta opiate radioligand [H-3]-deltorphine II binding in the rat brain. Bmax (maximal receptor density) and Kd (the dissociation constant) were directly determined at different brain regions of interest (ROI) selected for high densities of kappa and/or delta receptors in rats treated with BPN and/or CRZ. The agents were administered either once or for 21 consecutive days. Differences in Bmax and Kd (for both specific ligands) were related to drug treatment and receptor location. Globally, single BPN administration induced no changes in kappa or delta opiate receptor binding, whereas repeated BPN administration up-regulated kappa receptor density and decreased delta affinity. At the kappa receptor level, repeated administration of CRZ acted only on Kd, whereas the 6 receptor was up-regulated. Repeated addition of CRZ to BPN had no effect on kappa receptor Bmax versus chronic controls. By significantly decreasing Bmax, CRZ nullified the effect of chronic BPN on the kappa receptor. The modifications were strongest in the nucleus accumbens, where both types of receptor occur. Treatments had region-selective effects in some brain areas, such as the amygdala, periaqueductal gray matter, hypothalamus and caudate putamen. Increased p and delta receptor densities would be expected to provide reinforcement by enhancing reward, and impairment of kappa receptor availability would be expected to decrease aversion. The effects described are likely to influence addictive behavior among people abusing BZD and BPN. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Replacement with CS (20 400 mug/ml in drinking water) in adrenalectomized (ADX) animals was utilized to examine how the selective activation of mineralocorticoid (MR) and glucocorticoid (GR) receptors is related to the behavioral impairments induced by inescapable shock (IS). Available MR and GR levels were determined in hippocampal cytosol by radioligand binding assays. Non-CS replaced ADX animals showed a high percentage of escape failures assessed 48 h after IS. A CS does of 100 mug/ml given to ADX animals markedly reduced escape failures and resulted in an almost total reduction of available MR associated with a partial reduction of GR. However, the administration of aldosterone (ALDO), a selective MR agonist, was not sufficient to restore normal coping behavior. Moreover, an important role for GR was further shown by means of the specific GR antagonist, RU 38486, which blocked the reduction of LH in ADX rats that were given 100 mug/ml CS. Higher doses of CS given to ADX rats reinstated the LH behavior, and SHAM rats that produced stress CS levels also produced LH behavior. The results indicate a U-shaped dose response function with both negligible and high CS levels being associated with LH behavior. Hence, along with a moderate reduction of available GR level in the cytosol, a large decrease in MR availability seems to be necessary to prevent the acquisition and expression of LH. However, very high reduction of available GR is associated with LH behavior.

In contrast, it inhibits [H-3]NMS dissociation from M-1 to M4 receptors at submillimolar concentrations and from M-5 receptors at 1 mM. These results suggest that thiochrome binds allosterically to muscarinic receptors and has approximately neutral cooperativity with [H-3]NMS at M-1 to M-4 and possibly M-5 receptors. Thiochrome increases the affinity of acetylcholine (ACh) 3- to 5-fold for inhibiting [H-3]NMS binding to M-4 receptors but has no effect on ACh affinity at M-1 to M-3 or M-5 receptors. Thiochrome (0.1 mM) also increases the direct binding of [H-3]ACh to M-4 receptors but decreases it slightly at M-2 receptors. In agreement with the binding data, thiochrome does not affect the potency of ACh for stimulating the binding of guanosine 5'-O-(3-[S-35]thiotriphosphate) ([S-35]GTPgammaS) to membranes containing M-1 to M-3 receptors, but it increases ACh potency 3.5-fold at M-4 receptors. It also selectively reduces the release of [H-3]ACh from potassium-stimulated slices of rat striatum, which contain autoinhibitory presynaptic M-4 receptors, but not from hippocampal slices, which contain presynaptic M-2 receptors. We conclude that thiochrome is a selective M-4 muscarinic receptor enhancer of ACh affinity and has neutral cooperativity with ACh at M-1 to M-3 receptors; it therefore demonstrates a powerful new form of selectivity, "absolute subtype selectivity", which is derived from cooperativity rather than from affinity.

A new fluoropyridinyl derivative of (-)-cytisine (1), namely (-)-9-(2-fluoropyridinyl)cytisine (3, K-i values of 24 and 3462 nM for the alpha4beta2 and alpha7 nAChRs subtypes, respectively) has been synthesized in four chemical steps from (-)-cytisine and labelled with fluorine-18 (T-1/2: 119.8 min) using an efficient two-step radiochemical process [(a) nucleophilic heteroaromatic ortho-radiofluorination using the corresponding N-Boc-protected nitro-derivative, (b) TFA removal of the Boc protective group]. Typically, 20-45 mCi (0.74-1.67 GBq) of (-)-9-(2-[F-18]fluoropyridinyl)cytisine ([F-18]-3, 2-3 C-i/mumol or 74-111 GBq/pmol) were easily obtained in 70-75 min starting from a 100 mCi (3.7 GBq) aliquot of a cyclotron-produced [F-18]fluoride production batch (20-45% non decay-corrected yield based on the starting [F-18]fluoride). The in vivo pharmacological profile of (-)-9-(2-[F-18]fluoropyridinyl)cytisine ([F-18]-3) was evaluated in rats with biodistribution studies and brain radioactivity monitoring using intracerebral radiosensitive beta-microprobes. The observed in vivo distribution of the radiotracer in brain was rather uniform, and did not match with the known regional densities of nAChRs. It was also significantly different from that of the parent compound (-)-[H-3]cytisine. Moreover, competition studies with (-)-nicotine (5 mg/kg, 5 min before the radiotracer injection) did not reduce brain uptake of the radiotracer. These experiments clearly indicate that (-)-9-(2-[F-18]fluoropyridinyl)cytisine ([F-18]-3) does not have the required properties for imaging nAChRs using PET. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Incubation of synaptosomal membranes or brain sections with purified ACNE caused a developmentally modulated enhancement in the binding of [H-3]-(S)-AMPA and the specific AMPA receptor ligand [H-3] -(S)-5-fluorowillardiine, but did not modify binding to kainate neither N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. In all postnatal ages investigated (4, 7, 14, 20, 27, 40 days-old and adult rats), ACNE effect on binding was concentration-dependent and blocked by propidium, BW 284c51, diisopropylfluorophosphonate and eserine, therefore requiring indemnity of both peripheral and active sites of the enzyme. ACNE-mediated enhancement of [H-3]-fluorowillardiine binding was measurable in all major CNS areas, but displayed remarkable anatomical selectivity and developmental regulation. Autoradiograph densitometry exhibited distinct temporal profiles and peaks of treated/control binding ratios for different cortices, cortical layers, and nuclei. Within the parietal, occipital and temporal neocortices, hippocampal CA 1 field and cerebellum, AChE-potentiated binding ratios peaked in chronological correspondence with synaptogenesis periods of the respective AMPA-receptor containing targets. This modulation of AMPA receptors by ACNE is a molecular mechanism able to transduce localized neural activity into durable modifications of synaptic molecular structure and function. It might also contribute to ACNE-mediated neurotoxicity, as postulated in Alzheimer's disease and other CNS disorders. (C) 2002 ISDN. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

This account has recently been questioned because a number of inconsistencies have been reported that contradict it. In the present study, we investigated whether the decrease in [H-3]raclopride binding observed in the rat striatum after an amphetamine challenge reflects true competition with endogenous DA or agonist-mediated internalization of D-2-receptors. We found that the amphetamine-induced decrease in [H-3]raclopride binding is caused by a decrease in D-2-receptor density (Borax) with no change in affinity (K-d). In contrast, in the same tissue, neither the B-max nor the K-d were affected when measured with [H-3]spiperone. Challenge with amphetamine not only decreased the number of D-2-receptors but also eliminated the proportion (22%) of receptors usually in the high-affinity state. The addition of Gpp(NH)p had no effect on B-max, suggesting that these receptors were not just noncompetitively bound with dopamine at the cell-surface. Subcellular fractionation studies showed that amphetamine treatment led to a decrease in radioligand binding in the cell-surface fraction for both [H-3]raclopride and [H-3]spiperone; however, in the case of [H-3]spiperone, this was accompanied by a compensatory increase in binding in the intracellular compartment, whereas no increase was seen with [H-3]raclopride. These data suggest that amphetamine releases dopamine, which binds to the high-affinity state of the D-2-receptor, leading to its sequestration in some intracellular compartment; in this compartment, sequestered receptors are inaccessible to [H-3]raclopride binding but can still be bound by [H-3]spiperone.

The alpha(1)-antagonists used in this study were prazosin, tamsulosin and KMD-3213. Molecular modeling was performed on Octane 2 workstation (Silicon Graphics) using Discover/Insight 11 software (Molecular Simulations Inc.). Through molecular modeling, possible binding sites for these drugs were suggested to lie between transmembrane domains (TM) 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the alpha1-AR subtypes. In prazosin, the 4-amino group, 1-nitrogen atom and two methoxy groups of quinazoline ring possibly interact with the amino acids in TM3, TM5 and TM6 of alpha(1)-ARs. In tamsulosin, amine group of ethanyl amine chain, methoxy group of benzene ring and sulfonamide nitrogen of benzene ring interacts in TM3, TM4 and TM5 of alpha(1)-ARs. In KMD-3213, amine of ethyl amine chain and indoline nitrogen of this compound possibly interact within TM3 and TM5 of alpha(1A)-ARs. Amide nitrogen of KMD-3213 also interacts within TM4 of alpha(1A)-AR. The results of the present study suggested that prazosin has similar binding sites in all the alpha(1)-AR subtypes while tamsulosin interacts at higher number of sites with alpha(1D)-subtype than other alpha(1)-AR subtypes. KMD-3213 being an alpha(1A)-AR selective ligand, binds to higher number of sites Of alpha(1A) subtype than to other subtypes. All these amino acids are located near the extracellular loop. These findings are consistent with the previous studies that antagonists bind higher in the pocket closer to the extracellular surface unlike agonist binding. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Treatment of C6 glioma cells with either 5-HT or the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin resulted in an attenuation in 5-HT2A receptor function, specifically the accumulation of inositol phosphates stimulated by the partial agonist quipazine. 5-HT-induced desensitization of the 5-HT2A receptor involved receptor internalization through a clathrin- and dynamin-dependent process because it was prevented by concanavalin A, monodansylcadaverine, and by expression of the dominant negative mutants P-arrestin (319-418) and dynamin K44A. Although short-term (i.e., 10 min) 5-HT and ketanserin exposure resulted in the same degree of desensitization, ketanserin-induced desensitization was not prevented by these agents and did not involve receptor internalization. In contrast, prolonged ketanserin exposure (i.e., 2 h) resulted in 5-HT2A receptor internalization through a clathrin- and dynamin-dependent process, as was observed after agonist treatment. Inhibitors of protein kinase C or calcium-calmodulin kinase II did not attenuate or prevent 5-HT-induced desensitization of the receptor. 5-HT2A receptor desensitization induced by 5-HT and prolonged ketanserin treatment, but not by short-term ketanserin treatment, was prevented by the expression of the dominant negative mutant of G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK)2, GRK2-K220R, and by an anti-GRK2/3 antibody. Our data indicate a dual mechanism of early and late desensitization by the antagonist ketanserin. Short-term ketanserin treatment reduced the specific binding of the agonist radioligand [I-125](+/-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-lodophenyl)-2-aminopropane ([I-125]DOI) and the ability of 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate to attenuate this binding, suggesting that at the early stage of antagonist-induced desensitization the capacity of the 5-HT2A receptor to couple to G protein is impaired.

Using quantitative autoradiography on H-3-sensitive films, we have studied, in thaw-mounted sections of rat brain, the distribution and pharmacology of radioligand binding to sites with characteristics of the substrate-recognition/binding locus on GluT. The technique makes it possible to determine not only the intensity of binding in brain regions but, with a high level of precision, pharmacological constants such as IC50 or n(H). [H-3]L-aspartate and [H-3]D-aspartate are two classical radioligands used in studies of GluT. We have determined IC50 values for the inhibition of [H-3]L- and [H-3]D-aspartate binding by their non-radioactive counterparts in the cerebral neocortex, hippocampus, striatum, septal nuclei and the cerebellar cortex. The two radioligands did not appreciably differ from each other in their interactions with the binding sites in the forebrain, consistent with all Na+-dependent GluT binding sites in that region having no stereoselectivity for aspartate enantiomers. In the cerebellar cortex, however, the data indicated the presence of a GluT binding site that preferred L- over D-aspartate. These findings contrast with many previous observations and suggest that the pharmacological characteristics of the ligand binding sites on GluT in the mammalian cerebellar cortex may have to be re-assessed and/or a possibility of an existence of (a) hitherto unknown molecule(s) with properties of a glutamate transporter be considered.

However, studies on non-genomic steroid effects have also suggested the existence of ERs residing at the cell surface. In this work, we present immunological data supporting extra-nuclear ER alpha localization in uterine (SHM) and mammary (MCF-7) cell lines. Immunocytological studies performed on SHM cells revealed that native ERs mainly localize as a perinuclear cytoplasmic ring. The receptors were rapidly translocated to the nucleus by 17 beta -estradiol. In addition to nuclear ERs, a peripheral reservoir of ER alpha immuno reactivity, most probably associated with the plasma membrane, was detected in MCF-7 cells. These results were confirmed by the detection of membrane estrogen binding sites using fluorescent estrogen-BSA derivatives and ligand binding assays to intact cells, where [H-3]-estradiol could be partly displaced by impeded estrogen conjugates. Partial inhibition of radioligand binding by an antibody against the steroid binding domain of the ER alpha suggests that the isoform faces the extracellular media in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, ER alpha -like proteins (similar to 67 kDa) were found to be associated in isolated membrane subfractions from the cells. However, immunocytology of COS-1 (ER-negative) and SHM cells transfected with the complete cDNA coding for the cloned ERa and beta isoforms showed exclusive nuclear localization of the overexpressed ERs, The non-classical distribution of native ER alpha -like proteins in each cell line, suggests an alternative mode of ER alpha. cellular localization/function. Cell type-dependent processing may account for the differential localization shown by native and expressed receptors in the systems considered. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Design Sprague-Dawley rats were infused with either angiotensin II or vehicle for 14 days at a dose of 58.3 ng/ min, Ang Ii-infused rats were allocated to receive either an AT(1) antagonist, valsartan at a dose of 30 mg/kg per day or the AT(2) receptor antagonist PD123319 at a dose of 830 ng/min. Methods Gene and protein expression of the AT(2) receptor in the mesenteric vasculature was assessed by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry and by in vitro autoradiography with a specific radioligand, (1251)-CGp 42112B. Results The AT(2) receptor mRNA and protein were detected in the mesenteric artery from adult rats, Both nuclear emulsion and immunohistochemical staining showed expression of the AT(2) receptor in the adventitial and medial layers. Compared to control rats, angiotensin II infusion was associated with a significant increase in the AT2 receptor expression, Valsartan treatment significantly reduced AT(2) receptor gene expression, with no significant effect of PD123319 on this parameter. Conclusions This study confirms that the presence of the AT(2), receptor in mesenteric arteries in adult rats, shows an up-regulation of the AT(2) receptor following angiotensin II infusion and suggests a role for the AT(1) receptor in this regulation, In view of the recently demonstrated effects of the AT(2) receptor, these findings may be relevant to the role of the AT(2) receptor in the pathophysiology of vascular remodeling.

Ca-45(2+) effluxes were induced by membrane potentials generated via establishing K+ gradients across the vesicles, and were significantly inhibited by the inorganic Ca2+ channel blocker La3+ (1 mM) and the Ca2+ channel antagonist nifedipine (1-10 muM), Ethanol, in the concentration range of 100-400 mM, caused a significant suppression of depolarization-induced Ca-45(2+) fluxes. Ethanol also functionally modulated the effect of nifedipine (1-10 muM) and the Ca2+ channel agonist Bay K 8644 (1 muM) on Ca2+ effluxes. Pretreatment with pertussis toxin (5 mug/ml) or phorbol 12-myrstate 13-acetate (PMA, 50 nM) did not affect the ethanol inhibition of Ca-45(2+) fluxes. Further experiments with alcohols revealed that butanol, hexanol, octanol and decanol also significantly inhibited Ca-45(2+) effluxes. However, undecanol and dodecanol did not cause any significant change on Ca-45(2+) fluxes, indicating that the effects of alcohols on Ca-45(2+) effluxes exhibit a cut-off phenomenon. In radioligand binding studies, it was found that at the concentrations used in flux studies, alcohols did not alter the characteristics of the specific binding of [H-3]PN 200-110 to T-tubule membranes. Results indicate that ethanol directly inhibits the function of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels without modulating the specific binding of Ca2+ channel ligands of the dihydropyridine class, and that this inhibition is independent of intracellular Ca2+ levels.

Because circulatory failure in patients with septic shock is known to be less response to catecholamines, we investigated whether the beta -adrenoceptor-linked signal transduction mechanisms are altered in the heart of a septic animal model Methods: Rabbits were rendered endotoxemic by an intravenous injection of 100 mug/kg Escherichia coti lipopolysaccharide. Three and 6 h later, the myocardial tissues were used for the experiments. Results: The positive inotropic response to isoproterenol was significantly impaired in papillary muscles isolated from septic rabbits compared with those from controls. The impaired inotropic responsiveness to isoproterenol was not prevented by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N-G-nitro-L-arginine, indicating no involvement of nitric oxide overproduction. Adenylate cyclase activity stimulated with isoproterenol and 5'-guanylyl imidodiphosphate was markedly reduced in septic myocardium. The contractile and adenylate cyclase responses to colforsin daropate, a direct adenylate cyclase activator, were unaffected by sepsis, Radioligand binding experiments with (-)[I-125]iodocyanopindolol revealed no significant alteration in myocardial beta -adrenoceptor density or affinity in sepsis. Determination of cardiac G(s alpha) level by western blotting showed a reduction of approximately 50% in sepsis. The relative content of G(s alpha) messenger RNA in septic myocardium also was reduced from the control level by about 50%, as determined by Northern blot analysis. Little change was found in protein and messenger RNA levels of G(1 alpha) in septic myocardium. Conclusions: Impairment of myocardial functional responsiveness to beta -adrenoceptor stimulation appears in the early stage of sepsis, The impaired response to beta -adrenoceptor stimulation in the heart in this pathologic state may result in part from a decreased level of G(s alpha) protein which occurs at the level of gene expression.

Under systemic hypertension induced by angiotensin II (AII) infusion, an attenuated vasoconstrictive response to the infusion in tumours was observed and a marked increase in tumour blood flow was observed in comparison with that in normal tissues. The results show a parallel circuit that connects the vascular bed of the pre-existing tissue to that of the tumour. The phenomenon was absent when hypertension was provoked by other vasoconstrictive agents such as norepinephrine or endothelin-1. However, the biological basis for this attenuated vasoconstrictive response to angiotensin II observed in tumours has not been fully elucidated. Methods. We assessed this response to characterise the angiotensin II receptor density and affinity in normal and tumour tissues. AH109A and LY80 tumour cell lines were transplanted to the skin in nude rats. Four weeks later, the rats were sacrificed. I-125-[Sar1, Ile(8)] angiotensin II was used to map its receptors in rat tissues using in vitro computerised autoradiography. Operated human gastric cancer tissues from a 49-year-old and a 66-year-old male patients were also investigated. Results. The numbers of angiotensin II receptors were markedly reduced in tumour tissues without a change of affinity. The numbers in AII-R in tumours were shown to be mainly ATI by the marked reduction in radioligand binding achieved by losartan but not by PD123177. The same results were observed in human gastric cancer. Conclusions. These results suggest that the decrease in angiotensin II receptors in tumours may explain the haemodynamic effect of angiotensin II-induced hypertension on tumour blood flow. This condition for drug delivery to tumour tissue may play a major role in enhancing the therapeutic effects of chemotherapy.

For a better understanding of the physiological effect of SCs, the key issue is studying their metabolomic and psychoactive properties.In this study, our validated targeted reversed phase UHPLC-MS/MS method was used for determination of urinary concentration of 5F-MDMB-PICA, 4F-MDMB-BICA, and their primary metabolites. The liquid-liquid extraction procedure was applied for the enrichment of SCs. The pharmacological characterization of investigated SCs were studied by radioligand competition binding and ligand stimulated [35S]GTP gamma S binding assays.For 5F-MDMB-PICA and 4F-MDMB-BICA, the median urinary concentrations were 0.076 and 0.312 ng/mL. For primary metabolites, the concentration range was 0.029-881.02* ng/mL for 5F-MDMB-PICA-COOH, and 0.396-4579* ng/mL for 4F-MDMB-BICA-COOH. In the polydrug aspect, the 22 urine samples were verified to be abused with 6 illicit drugs. The affinity of the metabolites to CB1R significantly decreased compared to the parent ligands. In the GTP gamma S functional assay, both 5F-MDMB-PICA and 4F-MDMB-BICA were acting as full agonists, while the metabolites were found as weak inverse agonists. Additionally, the G-protein stimulatory effects of the full agonist 5F-MDMB-PICA and 4F-MDMB-BICA were reduced by metabolites. These results strongly indicate the dose-dependent CB1R-mediated weak inverse agonist effects of the two butanoic acid metabolites.The obtained high concentration of main urinary metabolites of 5F-MDMB-PICA and 4F-MDMB-BICA confirmed the relevance of their routine analysis in forensic and toxicological practices. Based on in vitro binding assays, the metabolites presumably might cause a lower psychoactive effect than parent compounds.

Overexpression of HER2 has been found in 80% of metastatic cases of prostate cancer. Previous research showed that HER2 is elevated post irradiation in PC-3 prostate cancer cells. Co-treating with anti-HER2 antibody Trastuzumab gave less proliferation of irradiated tumor cells in vitro, and when using radionuclide therapy, also in vivo. The aim of this study is to determine whether the same holds true in PSMA-expressing PC-3 PIP cells using [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 radionuclide therapy. PC-3 PIP and 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells were tested in vitro, treated with 6 Gy of x-rays with or without Trastuzumab incubation. We measured uptake of HER2-targeting affibody [Ga-68]Ga-ABY-025 and cell survival, e.g. using the WST-1 assay. Three groups (n=10 each) of male nude Balb/c mice were inoculated with PC-3 PIP xenograft tumors and treated with just [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 (20 MBq), [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 (20 MBq) and Trastuzumab (4 x 5 mg/kg), or left untreated. Tumor sizes and animal survival was observed. In vitro, x-ray irradiation did reduce survival in 22Rv1 but not PC-3 PIP cells, and there was no significant effect of Trastuzumab treatment. Cells expressed HER2 but not significantly elevated post irradiation. In vivo, mice co-treated with Trastuzumab had significantly longer survival than untreated mice, but not than only [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617. Staining of tumor sections showed similar HER2 and PSMA expression across groups. In conclusion, these results give no support for any benefit from co-treatment with anti-HER2 antibody for PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy.

The Skeletal Muscle Relaxer Cyclobenzaprine Is a Potent Non-Competitive Antagonist of Histamine H1 Receptors	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							LOCUS COERULEUS CELLS; HAMSTER OVARY CELLS; H-1 RECEPTORS; FUNCTIONAL-HETEROGENEITY; GUINEA-PIG; AGONIST; H1-RECEPTORS; PROTEIN; AMITRIPTYLINE; ASSAY	Cyclobenzaprine is a tricyclic dimethylpropanamine skeletal muscle relaxant, which is used clinically to decrease muscle spasm and hypercontractility, as well as acute musculoskeletal pain. Although the absolute mechanism of action of cyclobenzaprine remains elusive, it is known to mediate its effects centrally via inhibition of tonic somatic motor function, likely through modulation of noradrenergic and serotonergic systems. While cyclobenzaprine is effective as a muscle relaxant, greater than 30% of patients experience drowsiness and sedative-hypnotic effects, yet the mechanisms that cause this adverse effect are also undescribed. Based on this common adverse effect profile and the structural similarity of cyclobenzaprine to tricyclic antidepressants, as well as ethanolamine first-generation antihistamines, we hypothesized that cyclobenzaprine facilitates sedative effects via off-target antagonism of central histamine H1 receptors (H1Rs). Here, for the first time, we present data that demonstrate that cyclobenzaprine exhibits low nanomolar affinity for the cloned human H1R, as well as that expressed in both rat and mouse brain. Using saturation radioligand binding, we also demonstrate that cyclobenzaprine binds to the H1R in a noncompetitive manner. Similarly, functional assays measuring both Ca12 influx and novel TRUPATH G-protein subunit bioluminescence resonance energy transfer biosensors reveal that cyclobenzaprine also blocks histamine mediated H1R functional activity in a noncompetitive manner, whereas the classical H1R antagonist diphenhydramine does so competitively. Given that cyclobenzaprine readily crosses the blood-brain barrier and its muscle relaxant effects occur centrally, our data suggest that off-target central antagonism of H1R by cyclobenzaprine facilitates the significant sedative effect of this agent seen in patients. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Cyclobenzaprine, a clinically used muscle relaxant that is strongly linked to sedation, demonstrates high-affinity noncompetitive antagonism at the histamine H1 receptor. This effect likely modulates the high degree of sedation that patients experience.

Translational imaging techniques are needed to monitor the efficacy of strategies to prevent or mitigate neuroinflammation and alleviate ethanol-induced neurotoxicity. Opioid receptor antagonists such as nalmefene are antagonists of the toll-like receptor 4, which may block the proinflammatory signaling cascade induced by ethanol at this specific target. Male adolescent rats received a validated protocol of ethanol injection (i.p, 3 g/kg daily for two consecutive days followed by two resting days) during 14 days. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with the translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) radioligand [F-18]DPA-714 was performed at day-15. Toxicity induced by repeated binge-like ethanol exposure (71% mortality) was drastically reduced by nalmefene pretreatment (0.4 mg/kg, 14% mortality). No mortality was observed in animals that received vehicle (control) or nalmefene alone. Compared with control animals (n= 10), a significant 2.8-fold to 4.6-fold increase in the volume of distribution (V-T) of [F-18]DPA-714 was observed among brain regions in animals exposed to ethanol only (n= 9). Pretreatment with nalmefene significantly alleviated the neuroimmune response to ethanol exposure in all brain regions (1.2-fold to 2.5-fold increase inV(T);n= 5). Nalmefene alone (n= 6) did not impact [F-18]DPA-714V(T)compared with the control group. Nalmefene may protect against the neuroinflammatory response and overall toxicity associated with binge drinking. [F-18]DPA-714 PET imaging can be used to noninvasively address the neuroimmune impact of ethanol exposure and its modulation by pharmacological strategies in vivo, with translational perspectives.

[F-18] GE-179 binds to the phencyclidine (PCP) site in open NMDAR-ICs and potentially provides a use-dependent PET biomarker of these ion channels. Objective: To show [F-18]GE-179 PET can detect increased NMDAR-IC activation during electrical deep brain stimulation (DBS) of pig hippocampus. Methods: Six minipigs had an electrode implanted into their right hippocampus. They then had a baseline [F-18]GE-179 PET scan with DBS turned off followed by a second scan with DBS turned on. Brain [F-18]GE-179 uptake at baseline and then during DBS was measured with PET. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured with [O-15]H2O PET at baseline and during DBS and parametric CBF images were generated to evaluate DBS induced CBF changes. Functional effects of injecting the PCP blocker MK-801 were also evaluated. Electrode positions were later histologically verified. Results: DBS induced a 47.75% global increase in brain [F-18]GE-179 uptake (p = 0.048) compared to baseline. Global CBF was unchanged by hippocampal DBS. [F-18]GE-179 PET detected a 5% higher uptake in the implanted compared with the non-implanted temporo-parietal cortex at baseline (p = 0.012) and during stimulation (p = 0.022). Administration of MK-801 before DBS failed to block [F-18]GE-179 uptake during stimulation. Conclusion: PET detected an increase in global brain [F-18]GE-179 uptake during unilateral hippocampal DBS while CBF remained unchanged. These findings support that [F-18] GE-179 PET provides a usedependent marker of abnormal NMDAR-IC activation. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Pretargeted Radioimmunotherapy Based on the Inverse Electron Demand Diets-Alder Reaction	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS			English	Article						Chemistry; Issue 143; radioimmunotherapy; pretargeted radioimmunotherapy; pretargeting; inverse electron demand Diets-Alder reaction; tetrazine; trans-cyclooctene; huA33; A33 antigen; lutetium-177	IN-VIVO CHEMISTRY; BISPECIFIC ANTIBODY; CELL LYMPHOMA; TUMOR; PET; CANCER; TOSITUMOMAB; CARCINOMA; STRATEGY; DIABODY	While radioimmunotherapy (RIT) is a promising approach for the treatment of cancer, the long pharmacokinetic half-life of radiolabeled antibodies can result in high radiation doses to healthy tissues. Perhaps not surprisingly, several different strategies have been developed to circumvent this troubling limitation. One of the most promising of these approaches is pretargeted radioimmunotherapy (PRIT). PRIT is predicated on decoupling the radionuclide from the immunoglobulin, injecting them separately, and then allowing them to combine in vivo at the target tissue. This approach harnesses the exceptional tumor-targeting properties of antibodies while skirting their pharmacokinetic drawbacks, thereby lowering radiation doses to non-target tissues and facilitating the use of radionuclides with half-lives that are considered too short for use in traditional radioimmunoconjugates. Over the last five years, our laboratory and others have developed an approach to in vivo pretargeting based on the inverse electron-demand Diels-Alder (IEDDA) reaction between trans-cyclooctene (TCO) and tetrazine (Tz). This strategy has been successfully applied to pretargeted positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging with a variety of antibody-antigen systems. In a pair of recent publications, we have demonstrated the efficacy of IEDDA-based PRIT in murine models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and colorectal carcinoma. In this protocol, we describe protocols for PRIT using a 177 Lu-DOTAlabeled tetrazine radioligand ([Lu-177]Lu-DOTA-PEG(7)-Tz) and a TCO-modified variant of the colorectal cancer targeting huA33 antibody (huA33-TCO). More specifically, we will describe the construction of huA33-TCO, the synthesis and radiolabeling of [Lu-177]Lu-DOTA-PEG(7)-Tz, and the performance of in vivo biodistribution and longitudinal therapy studies in murine models of colorectal carcinoma.

Therefore, PDE4 inhibitors are one of key targets potential for drug development. Investigation of brain PDE4 occupancy would help to understand the effects of PDE4 inhibition to cognitive functions. Roflumilast is a selective phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) inhibitor used clinically for severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but the effects to the brain have not been well investigated. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether roflumilast entered the brain and occupied PDE4 in nonhuman primates. Positron emission tomography (PET) measurements with (R)-[C-11]rolipram were performed at baseline and after intravenous (i.v.) administration of roflumilast (3.6 to 200 mu g/kg) in three female rhesus monkeys. Arterial blood samples were taken to obtain the input function. Protein binding was measured to obtain the free fraction (fp) of the radioligand. Total distribution volume (V (T)) and V (T)/fp were calculated as outcome measures from two tissue compartment model. Lassen plot approach was taken to estimate the target occupancy. The brain uptake of (R)-[C-11]rolipram decreased after roflumilast administration. PDE 4 occupancy by roflumilast showed dose- and plasma concentration-dependent increase, although PDE4 occupancy did not reach 50 % even after the administration of up to 200 mu g/kg of roflumilast, regardless of outcome measures, V (T) or V (T)/fp. This PET study showed that the brain PDE4 binding was blocked to a certain extent after i.v. administration of clinical relevant doses of roflumilast in nonhuman primates. Further clinical PET evaluation is needed to understand the relationship between PDE4 inhibition and potential improvement of cognitive function in human subjects.

To clarify whether [C-11] PBB3 binds to alpha-synuclein pathology, reactivity of PBB3 was assessed by in vitro fluorescence and autoradiographic labeling of brain sections from alpha-synucleinopathies patients. Method: Of 10 pure Lewy body disease and 120 multiple system atrophy (MSA) cases in the Mayo Clinic brain bank, we selected 3 Lewy body disease and 4 MSA cases with a range of alpha-synuclein severity based on the quantitative analysis of alpha-synuclein burden. PBB3 fluorescence labeling, double or single immunostaining for alpha-synuclein and phospho-tau, Prussian blue staining, and in vitro autoradiography with [C-11] PBB3 were performed for these selected samples. Results: PBB3 fluorescence labeled various alpha-synuclein lesions including Lewy bodies, Lewy neurites,spheroids, glial cytoplasmic inclusions, and neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions. Meanwhile, autoradiographic labeling with [C-11] PBB3 at 10nM demonstrated no significant binding in Lewy body disease cases. In contrast, significant autoradiographic binding of [C-11] PBB3 to the striatopallidal fibers was found in 2 MSA cases, which had high densities of glial cytoplasmic inclusions without tau or iron deposits in this region. Conclusions: Given that the maximum concentration of [C-11] PBB3 in human PET scans is approximately 10 nM, the present data imply that alpha-synuclein pathology in Lewy body disease is undetectable by [C-11] PBB3-PET, whereas those in a subset of MSA cases with high densities of glial cytoplasmic inclusions could be captured by this radioligand.

This study sought to minimize the number of necessary blood samples by developing a factor-analysis-based image-derived input function (IDIF) methodology for dynamic PET brain studies. Materials and methods IDIF estimation was performed as follows: (a) carotid and background regions were segmented manually on an early PET time frame; (b) blood-weighted and tissue-weighted time-activity curves (TACs) were extracted with factor analysis; (c) factor analysis results were denoised and scaled using the voxels with the highest blood signal; (d) using population data and one blood sample at 40 min, whole-blood TAC was estimated from postprocessed factor analysis results; and (e) the parent concentration was finally estimated by correcting the whole-blood curve with measured radiometabolite concentrations. The methodology was tested using data from 10 healthy individuals imaged with [C-11](R)-rolipram. The accuracy of IDIFs was assessed against full arterial sampling by comparing the area under the curve of the input functions and by calculating the total distribution volume (V-T). Results The shape of the image-derived whole-blood TAC matched the reference arterial curves well, and the whole-blood area under the curves were accurately estimated (mean error 1.0 +/- 4.3%). The relative Logan-V-T error was -4.1 +/- 6.4%. Compartmental modeling and spectral analysis gave less accurate V-T results compared with Logan. Conclusion A factor-analysis-based IDIF for [C-11](R)-rolipram brain PET studies that relies on a single blood sample and population data can be used for accurate quantification of Logan-V-T values.

However, the enantioselective preference of the alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR subtype still remains unknown. Since the two enantiomers exhibit different pharmacological profiles and stereoselective metabolism, the aim of this study is to assess a possible difference in the interaction of the MDMA enantiomers with this nAChR subtype. To this end, we report a novel simple, yet highly efficient enantioselective synthesis of the MDMA enantiomers, in which the key step is the diastereoselective reduction of imides derived from optically pure tert-butylsulfinamide. The enantioselective binding to the receptor is examined using [H-3]epibatidine in a radioligand assay. Even though the two enantiomers induced a concentration-dependent binding displacement, (S)-MDMA has an inhibition constant 13-fold higher than (R)-MDMA, which shows a Hill's coefficient not significantly different from unity, implying a competitive interaction. Furthermore, when NGF-differentiated PC12 cells were pretreated with the compounds, a significant increase in binding of [H-3]epibatidine was found for (R)-MDMA, indicating up-regulation of heteromeric nAChR in the cell surface. Finally, docking and molecular dynamics studies have been used to identify the binding mode of the two enantiomers, which provides a structural basis to justify the differences in affinity from the differential interactions played by the substituents at the stereogenic centre of MDMA. The results provide a basis to explore the distinct psychostimulant profiles of the MDMA enantiomers mediated by the alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR subtype. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Binding kinetics differentiates functional antagonism of orexin-2 receptor ligands	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						orexin; kinetics; equilibrium; suvorexant; almorexant; EMPA; association; dissociation; ERK; inositol phosphate	DISSOCIATION; INHIBITOR; MODELS; SLEEP; CCR5; OX1	Orexin receptor antagonism represents a novel approach for the treatment of insomnia that directly targets sleep/wake regulation. Several such compounds have entered into clinical development, including the dual orexin receptor antagonists, suvorexant and almorexant. In this study, we have used equilibrium and kinetic binding studies with the orexin-2 (OX2) selective antagonist radioligand, [H-3]-EMPA, to profile several orexin receptor antagonists. Furthermore, selected compounds were studied in cell-based assays of inositol phosphate accumulation and ERK-1/2 phosphorylation in CHO cells stably expressing the OX2 receptor that employ different agonist incubation times (30 and 5min, respectively). EMPA, suvorexant, almorexant and TCS-OX-29 all bind to the OX2 receptor with moderate to high affinity (pK(I) values 7.5), whereas the primarily OX1 selective antagonists SB-334867 and SB-408124 displayed low affinity (pK(I) values ca. 6). Competition kinetic analysis showed that the compounds displayed a range of dissociation rates from very fast (TCS-OX2-29, k(off) = 0.22min(-1)) to very slow (almorexant, k(off) = 0.005min(-1)). Notably, there was a clear correlation between association rate and affinity. In the cell-based assays, fast-offset antagonists EMPA and TCS-OX2-29 displayed surmountable antagonism of orexin-A agonist activity. However, both suvorexant and particularly almorexant cause concentration-dependent depression in the maximal orexin-A response, a profile that is more evident with a shorter agonist incubation time. Analysis according to a hemi-equilibrium model suggests that antagonist dissociation is slower in a cellular system than in membrane binding; under these conditions, almorexant effectively acts as a pseudo-irreversible antagonist.

This evidence has led to the exploration of dopamine receptor blockers as pharmacotherapy for cocaine addiction. While neither D-1 nor D-2 receptor antagonists have proven effective, medications acting at two other potential targets, D-3 and D-4 receptors, have yet to be explored for this indication in the clinic. Buspirone, a 5-HT1A partial agonist approved for the treatment of anxiety, has been reported to also bind with high affinity to D-3 and D-4 receptors. In view of this biochemical profile, the present research was conducted to examine both the functional effects of buspirone on these receptors and, in non-human primates, its ability to modify the reinforcing effects of i.v. cocaine in a behaviourally selective manner. Radioligand binding studies confirmed that buspirone binds with high affinity to recombinant human D-3 and D-4 receptors (similar to 98 and similar to 29 nM respectively). Live cell functional assays also revealed that buspirone, and its metabolites, function as antagonists at both D-3 and D-4 receptors. In behavioural studies, doses of buspirone that had inconsistent effects on food-maintained responding (0.1 or 0.3 mg/kg i.m.) produced a marked downward shift in the dose-effect function for cocaine-maintained behaviour, reflecting substantial decreases in self-administration of one or more unit doses of i.v. cocaine in each subject. These results support the further evaluation of buspirone as a candidate medication for the management of cocaine addiction.

Small molecule chemokine mimetics suggest a molecular basis for the observation that CXCL10 and CXCL11 are allosteric ligands of CXCR3	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Chemokine; chemokine receptors; molecular modelling; small molecule agonist; CXCL10; CXCL11; CXCR3	CELL-ALPHA CHEMOATTRACTANT; RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS; INTERNATIONAL UNION; BINDING; PROTEIN; IDENTIFICATION; INTERNALIZATION; PHARMACOLOGY; SELECTIVITY; AGONISTS	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The chemokine receptor CXCR3 directs migration of T-cells in response to the ligands CXCL9/Mig, CXCL10/IP-10 and CXCL11/I-TAC. Both ligands and receptors are implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory disorders, including atherosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Here, we describe the molecular mechanism by which two synthetic small molecule agonists activate CXCR3. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH As both small molecules are basic, we hypothesized that they formed electrostatic interactions with acidic residues within CXCR3. Nine point mutants of CXCR3 were generated in which an acidic residue was mutated to its amide counterpart. Following transient expression, the ability of the constructs to bind and signal in response to natural and synthetic ligands was examined. KEY RESULTS The CXCR3 mutants D112N, D195N and E196Q were efficiently expressed and responsive in chemotaxis assays to CXCL11 but not to CXCL10 or to either of the synthetic agonists, confirmed with radioligand binding assays. Molecular modelling of both CXCL10 and CXCR3 suggests that the small molecule agonists mimic a region of the 30s loop (residues 3040 of CXCL10) which interacts with the intrahelical CXCR3 residue D112, leading to receptor activation. D195 and E196 are located in the second extracellular loop and form putative intramolecular salt bridges required for a CXCR3 conformation that recognizes CXCL10. In contrast, CXCL11 recognition by CXCR3 is largely independent of these residues. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS We provide here a molecular basis for the observation that CXCL10 and CXCL11 are allosteric ligands of CXCR3. Such findings may have implications for the design of CXCR3 antagonists. LINKED ARTICLE This article is commented on by O'Boyle, pp. 895897 of this issue.

To gain more information about the binding of this peptide toxin, we studied the properties of the [H-3]UK14,304 agonist and the [H-3]MK-912 antagonist binding to the alpha(2B)-adrenoceptor in the presence of MT alpha. In equilibrium binding experiments, MT alpha decreased the binding of the orthosteric ligands, but failed to completely displace these. This effect of MT alpha was due to noncompetitive inhibition of B-max without change in radioligand affinity. On the contrary, cellular signaling via the alpha(2B)-adrenoceptor could be titrated to zero despite the incomplete receptor blockade. To locate binding sites for MT alpha on the receptor protein, we generated chimeric receptors of alpha(2B)- and alpha(2A)- or alpha(2C)-adrenoceptors. Data based on these constructs revealed the extracellular loop two (ECL2) as the structural entity that enables MTa binding. Cumulative exchange of parts of ECL2 of alpha(2B) for alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor sequence resulted in a gradual decrease in the affinity for MT alpha, indicating that MT alpha binds to the alpha(2B)-adrenoceptor through multiple sites dispersed over the whole ECL2. Together the results suggest that binding of MT alpha to the alpha(2B)-adrenoceptor occludes orthosteric ligand access to the binding pocket. Putative homomeric receptor complexes as factors underlying the apparent noncompetitivity are also discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

This has lead to a search for selective 5-HT6 receptor ligands useful for in vivo imaging in animals and humans. The novel 5-HT6 receptor antagonist Lu AE60157 (8-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-3-phenylsulfonylquinoline) displays high affinity for the human (h) 5-HT6 receptor (K-d 0.2 nM), and broad profiling in 60 additional binding and enzyme assays showed that Lu AE60157 displays 16-fold selectivity to the h5-HT2A receptor (K-i 3.2 nM) and > 100-fold selectivity to all other evaluated targets. Lu AE60157 was labeled with tritium in the N-methyl group and evaluated as a radio-ligand in vitro as well as in vivo in rats and mice. Autoradiography experiments showed that [H-3]Lu AE60157 bound preferentially to rat brain regions with expected high 5-HT6 receptor density. Furthermore, [H-3]Lu AE60157 showed good brain penetration after systemic administration and high (about 75%) specific in vivo binding to the striatal 5-HT6 receptor in rats. The striatal binding of [H-3]Lu AE60157 was fully displaced by selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonists (SB-742457; Lu AE58054) and antipsychotics known to inhibit the binding of 5-HT6 receptors in vitro (clozapine; olanzapine; sertindole), but was not displaced by antipsychotics lacking high 5-HT6 receptor affinities (risperidone; haloperidol; quetiapine). No specific binding to mouse brain tissue in vivo could be obtained.

Recent studies strongly support that the CXCR3 receptor is a very attractive therapeutic target for treating autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and psoriasis, and to prevent transplant rejection. We describe here the in vitro and in vivo pharmacological characterizations of a novel and potent small molecule CXCR3 antagonist, SCH 546738. Results: In this study, we evaluated in vitro pharmacological properties of SCH 546738 by radioligand receptor binding and human activated T cell chemotaxis assays. In vivo efficacy of SCH 546738 was determined by mouse collagen-induced arthritis, rat and mouse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and rat cardiac transplantation models. We show that SCH 546738 binds to human CXCR3 with a high affinity of 0.4 nM. In addition, SCH 546738 displaces radiolabeled CXCL10 and CXCL11 from human CXCR3 with IC50 ranging from 0.8 to 2.2 nM in a non-competitive manner. SCH 546738 potently and specifically inhibits CXCR3-mediated chemotaxis in human activated T cells with IC90 about 10 nM. SCH 546738 attenuates the disease development in mouse collagen-induced arthritis model. SCH 546738 also significantly reduces disease severity in rat and mouse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models. Furthermore, SCH 546738 alone achieves dose-dependent prolongation of rat cardiac allograft survival. Most significantly, SCH 546738 in combination with CsA supports permanent engraftment. Conclusions: SCH 546738 is a novel, potent and non-competitive small molecule CXCR3 antagonist. It is efficacious in multiple preclinical disease models. These results demonstrate that therapy with CXCR3 antagonists may serve as a new strategy for treatment of autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, and to prevent transplant rejection.

Receptor binding mode and pharmacological characterization of a potent and selective dual CXCR1/CXCR2 non-competitive allosteric inhibitor	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						chemokine receptors; CXCR1; CXCR2; non-competitive allosteric inhibitor; binding mode; leucocyte recruitment; experimental angiogenesis; ischaemia reperfusion injury	ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH-FACTOR; MONOCYTE CHEMOATTRACTANT PROTEIN-1; ISCHEMIA-REPERFUSION INJURY; DELAYED GRAFT FUNCTION; T-CELL RECRUITMENT; CXC CHEMOKINES; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY; HUMAN NEUTROPHILS; RAT-LIVER; ISCHEMIA/REPERFUSION	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE DF 2156A is a new dual inhibitor of IL-8 receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2 with an optimal pharmacokinetic profile. We characterized its binding mode, molecular mechanism of action and selectivity, and evaluated its therapeutic potential. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH The binding mode, molecular mechanism of action and selectivity were investigated using chemotaxis of L1.2 transfectants and human leucocytes, in addition to radioligand and [S-35]-GTP gamma S binding approaches. The therapeutic potential of DE 2156A was evaluated in acute (liver ischaemia and reperfusion) and chronic (sponge-induced angiogenesis) experimental models of inflammation. KEY RESULTS A network of polar interactions stabilized by a direct ionic bond between DF 2156A and Lys(99) on CXCR1 and the non-conserved residue Asp(293) on CXCR2 are the key determinants of DF 2156A binding. DF 2156A acted as a non-competitive allosteric inhibitor blocking the signal transduction leading to chemotaxis without altering the binding affinity of natural ligands. DF 2156A effectively and selectively inhibited CXCR1/CXCR2-mediated chemotaxis of L1.2 transfectants and leucocytes. In a murine model of sponge-induced angiogenesis, DF 2156A reduced leucocyte influx, INF-alpha production and neovessel formation. In vitro, DF 2156A prevented proliferation, migration and capillary-like organization of HUVECs in response to human IL-8. In a rat model of liver ischaemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury, DF 2156A decreased PMN and monocyte-macrophage infiltration and associated hepatocellular injury. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS DF 2156A is a non-competitive allosteric inhibitor of both IL-8 receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2. It prevented experimental angiogenesis and hepatic I/R injury in vivo and, therefore, has therapeutic potential for acute and chronic inflammatory diseases.	[Bertini, R.; Beccari, A.

Gordon			Positron Emission Tomography Imaging of Dopamine D2/3 Receptors in the Human Cortex With [<SUP>11</SUP>C]FLB 457: Reproducibility Studies	SYNAPSE			English	Article						PET; DA; D2/3 receptors; [C-11]FLB 457; human cortex	TEST-RETEST ANALYSIS; HUMAN BRAIN; IN-VIVO; BINDING; RADIOTRACERS; VALIDATION; MODEL; PET	In a recent PET study, we demonstrated the ability to measure amphetamine- induced DA release in the human cortex with the relatively high affinity dopamine D-2/3 radioligand [C-11]FLB 457 (Narendran et al., [2009] Synapse 63: 447-461). The aim of this study was to evaluate the reproducibility and reliability of [C-11]FLB 457 in the same imaging paradigm we used to measure amphetamine-induced DA transmission. Six healthy human subjects (three males/three females) were studied twice with [C-11]FLB 457, once at baseline and again 3 h following the end of the baseline scan. D-2/3 receptor binding parameters were estimated using a two-tissue compartment kinetic analysis in the cortical regions of interest and cerebellum (reference region). The test-retest variability and intraclass correlation coefficient were assessed for distribution volume (V-T), binding potential relative to plasma concentration (BPP), and binding potential relative to nondisplaceable uptake (BPND) of [(11) C] FLB 457. The test-retest variability of [C-11]FLB 457 V-T, BPP, and BPND were <= 15%, consistent with the published test-retest variability for this ligand in other brain regions (Sudo et al., [2001] Nucl Med Commun 22: 1215-1221; Vilkman et al., [2000] Eur J Nucl Med 27: 1666-1673). In addition, no significant decrease in [C-11] FLB 457 BPND was observed in the second scan compared to the first one. This suggests that the contribution of carryover mass of [C-11]FLB 457 to the measured reduction in [C-11] FLB 457 BPND following amphetamine was relatively low. These data support the further validation of [C-11]FLB 457 as a tool to measure amphetamine-induced dopamine release in the human cortex. Synapse 65:35-40, 2011. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Binding of dopamine and 3-methoxytyramine as L-DOPA metabolites to human α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors	NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH			English	Article						L-DOPA; Metabolites; Binding; Adreneoceptors; Dopaminergic receptors	HUMAN ALPHA(2A)-ADRENERGIC RECEPTOR; LEVODOPA-INDUCED DYSKINESIA; SITE-DIRECTED MUTAGENESIS; LESIONED PRIMATE MODEL; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; MOTOR FLUCTUATIONS; METHYL-ESTER; ANTAGONIST IDAZOXAN; ADENYLYL-CYCLASE; LIGAND-BINDING	The ability of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), L-DOPA-methyl ester and their major metabolites, dopamine, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic (HVA), 3-O-methyldopa and 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT) to bind to alpha(2) adrenergic and D1 and D2 dopamine receptors was assessed by radioligand binding to cloned human receptors expressed in cell lines. As anticipated, dopamine bound with high affinity to D1 (IC50 1.1 +/- 0.16 mu M) and D2 (IC50 0.7 +/- 0.3 mu M) dopamine receptors. However, dopamine also bound with high affinity to alpha(2A) (IC50 was 2.6 +/- 0.5 mu M), alpha(2C) (IC50 3.2 +/- 0.7 mu M). 3-MT bound to alpha(2A) with high affinity (IC50, 3.6 +/- 0.2 mu M) though moderate affinity to alpha(2C), D1 and D2 receptors (values of IC50 were 55 +/- 14, 121 +/- 43, 36 +/- 141 mu M, respectively). L-DOPA-methyl ester bound with high affinity to alpha(2) (IC50 17-36 mu M) but not dopamine receptors (IC50 0.9-2.5 mM). L-DOPA, 3-O-methyldopa and DOPAC had no observable effect on binding to any of the receptors tested. These data suggest that the effects of L-DOPA in Parkinson's disease may result from actions of its metabolites dopamine and 3-MT on both dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic receptors. These findings may provide explanations for the differences between L-DOPA and dopamine receptor agonists in mediating anti-parkinsonian effects and propensity to be associated with dyskinesia and motor complications such as wearing-off and on-off.

We found that rapamycin induces the TGF beta/Smad signaling cascade in rat mesangial cells (MC) as depicted by the nuclear translocation of phospho-Smads 2, -3 and Smad-4, respectively. Concomitantly, rapamycin increases the nuclear DNA binding of receptor (R)- and co-Smad proteins to a cognate Smad-binding element (SBE) which in turn causes an increase in profibrotic gene expression as exemplified by the connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1). Using small interfering (si)RNA we demonstrate that Smad 2/3 activation by rapamycin depends on its endogenous receptor FK binding protein 12 (FKBP12). Mechanistically, Smad induction by rapamycin is initiated by an increase in active TGF beta(1) as shown by ELISA and by the inhibitory effects of a neutralizing TGF beta antibody. Using an activin receptor-like kinase (ALK)-5 inhibitor and by siRNA against the TGF beta type II receptor (TGF beta-RII) we furthermore demonstrate a functional involvement of both types of TGF beta receptors. However, rapamycin did not compete with TGF beta for TGF beta-receptor binding as found in radioligand-binding assay. Besides SB203580, a specific inhibitor of the p38 MAPK, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) and a cell-permeable superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic strongly abrogated the stimulatory effects of rapamycin on Smad 2 and 3 phosphorylation. Furthermore, the rapid increase in dichlorofluorescein (DCF) formation implies that rapamycin mainly acts through ROS. In conclusion, activation of the profibrotic TGF beta/Smad signaling cascade accompanies the immunosuppressive and antiproliferative actions of rapamycin. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Contractions by KCl and radioligand binding techniques were used to verify if Call Channels are modified in rat vas deferens of 40-day old litters that were breastfed by mothers injected daily with nifedipine during nursery. Injections were applied in the beginning (1st until 8th day), middle (9th until 16th day), or end (17th until 24th day) of nursery, to verify the period of highest susceptibility of newborn to nifedipine receptor regulation. Contractile responses revealed that only after the middle period of treatment of mothers the maximal effects (E-max) induced in pups by KCl were increased by about 35%, without changes of apparent affinity (pD(2)). Additionally, binding studies with [H-3] Isradipine in cell membrane preparations showed a greater density (B-max) of Ca2+ channels by about 55%, without changes of affinity (K-d). Changes were not detected after treatment of mothers in the beginning or end of breastfeeding. In addition, in vas deferens of 60-day old litters, the E-max returned to control values, showing that changes were not persistent. Moreover, body and vas deferens weights and blood testosterone of newborn were never changed. The histology of mammary gland was similar for treated and control mothers, suggesting a stable milk production. It is concluded that nifedipine treatment of mothers, if made during the 9th to 16th day of lactation, produced a short lasting reversible up-regulation of L-type Ca2+ channels.

Identification of regions of the P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor that contribute to human and rat species differences in antagonist effects	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						P2X(7) receptor; BzATP; KN62; SB203580; GW791343; PPADS	POTENT ANTAGONIST; ATP; DISCOVERY; CLONING; PAIN	Background and purpose: Several P2X(7) receptor antagonists are allosteric inhibitors and exhibit species difference in potency. Furthermore, N-2-(3,4- difluorophenyl)-N-1-(2-methyl-5-(1-piperazinylmethyl)phenyl)glycinamide dihydrochloride (GW791343) exhibits negative allosteric effects at the human P2X(7) receptor but is a positive allosteric modulator of the rat P2X(7) receptor. In this study we have identified several regions of the P2X(7) receptor that contribute to the species differences in antagonist effects. Experimental approach: Chimeric human-rat P2X(7) receptors were constructed with regions of the rat receptor being inserted into the human receptor. Antagonist effects at these receptors were measured in ethidium accumulation and radioligand binding studies. Key results: Exchanging regions of the P2X(7) receptor close to transmembrane domain 1 modified the effects of KN62, 4-(4fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulphinylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)1H-imidazole (SB203580) and GW791343. Further studies, in which single amino acids were exchanged, identified amino acid 95 as being primarily responsible for the differential allosteric effects of GW791343 and, to varying degrees, the species differences in potency of SB203580 and KN62. The species selectivity of pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulphonic acid was affected by multiple regions of the receptor, with potency being particularly affected by the amino acid 126 but not by amino acid 95. A further region of the rat receptor (amino acids 154-183) was identified that, when inserted into the corresponding position in the human receptor, increased ATP potency 10-fold. Conclusions: This study has identified several key residues responsible for the species differences in antagonist effects at the P2X(7) receptor and also identified a further region of the P2X(7) receptor that can significantly affect agonist potency at the P2X(7) receptor.

In the cystornetry of CYP-treated rats compared with control rats, the micturition interval and micturition volume were significantly (55% and 77%, respectively) decreased and the frequency of micturition and basal pressure were significantly (3 and 2.3 times, respectively) increased. These changes in urodynamic parameters may characterize the detrusor overactivity occurring in CYP-treated rats. The maximal number of binding sites (B-max) for specific binding of [N-methyl-H-3]scopolamine methyl chloride ([H-3]NMS) and alpha beta-methylene ATP [2,8-H-3]tetrasodium salt ([H-3]alpha beta-MeATP) was significantly (43% and 31%, respectively) decreased in the bladder of CYP-treated rats compared with control rats. On the other hand, the apparent dissociation constant (K-d) for neither radioligand was significantly altered by the CYP treatment. K-i value for the inhibition of bladder [H-3]NMS binding by antimuscarinic agents (oxybutynin, tolterodine, darifenacin, and AF-DX 116) did not differ significantly between control and CYP-treated rats. The inhibition constant (K-i) for the inhibition of bladder [H-3]alpha beta-MeATP binding by purinergic antagonists (A-317491, PPADS) was significantly higher in CYP-treated rats than control rats. In conclusion, CYP treatment has been shown to cause down-regulation of pharmacologically relevant (muscarinic and purinergic) receptors in the bladder of rats. Thus, the present study offers further pharmacological evidence that both muscarinic and purinergic mechanisms contribute significantly to the urinary dysfunction due to IC.

Expression and functional purification of a glycosylation deficient version of the human adenosine 2a receptor for structural studies	PROTEIN EXPRESSION AND PURIFICATION			English	Article						G-protein coupled receptor; adenosine 2a receptor; membrane protein; expression; Pichia pastoris; purification; structure determination	YEAST PICHIA-PASTORIS; PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; MU-OPIOID RECEPTOR; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; ANTAGONIST RADIOLIGAND; CANNABINOID RECEPTOR; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; A(2A) RECEPTORS; RHODOPSIN; BINDING	A glycosylation deficient (dG) version of the human adenosine 2a receptor (hA2aR) was made in Pichia pastoris strain SMD1163. Under optimal conditions, expression levels of between 8 and 12 pmol receptor/mg membrane protein were obtained routinely. In a shake flask, this is equivalent to ca. 0.2 mg of receptor per litre of culture. The level of functional receptor produced was essentially independent of the pH of the yeast media. In contrast to this, addition of the hA2aR antagonist theophylline to the culture media caused a twofold increase in receptor expression. A similar effect on dG hA2aR production was also observed when the induction temperature was reduced from 29 to 22 degrees C. In P. pastoris membranes, dG hA2aR had native-like pharmacological properties, binding antagonists with rank potency ZM241385 > XAC > theophylline, as well as the agonist NECA. Furthermore, the receptor was made with its large (ca. 120 amino acid) C-terminal domain intact. dG hA2aR was purified to homogeneity in three steps, and its identity confirmed by electrospray tandem mass spectrometry following digestion with trypsin. The secondary structure of the entire receptor is largely (ca. 81%) alpha-helical. Purified dG hA2aR bound [H-3]ZM241385 in a saturable manner with a B-max of 18.1 +/- 0.5 nmol/mg protein, close to the theoretical B-max value for pure protein (21.3 nmol/mg protein), showing that the receptor had retained its functionality during the purification process. Regular production of pure dG hA2aR in milligram quantities has enabled crystallisation trials to be started. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Noninvasive detection of MMP expression might allow physicians to better determine when more aggressive cancer therapy is appropriate. The peptide CTT (CTTHWGFTLC) was identified as a selective inhibitor of MMP-2/9 that inhibits the growth of MDA-MI3-435 human breast cancer xenografts. Methods: CTT was conjugated with the bifunctional chelator DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclotetradecane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic acid) for radiolabeling with 64 Cu (t(1/2)= 12.7 h, 17.4% beta(+), 39% beta(-)), a radionclide suitable for positron emission tomography (PET). In vitro affinity was determined in a fluorogenic substrate assay. Tumor gelatinase targeting was evaluated in both biodistribution and microPET imaging studies. Results: Cu(II)-DOTA-CTT inhibited hMMP-2 (EC50=8.7 mu M) and mMMP-9 (EC50= 18.2 mu m) with similar affinity to CTT (hMMP-2 EC50= 13.2 mu M; mMMP-9 EC50= 11.0 mu M). In biodistribution and microPET imaging studies, Cu-64-DOTA-CTT was taken Lip by MMP-2/ 9-positive B16F10 murine melanoma tumors. Subsequently, imaging studies using Cu-64-DOTA-CTT were performed on MDA-MB-435 tumor-bearing mice. With zymography, tumor MMP-2/9 expression in this model was shown to be inconsistent, resulting in microPET detection of the MDA-MB-435 tumor in only 1 of 24 imaged mice. Following limited imaging success, 64 Cu-DOTA-CTT was shown to have poor in vivo stability. Conclusions: Despite sonic evidence for selective uptake of Cu-64-DOTA-CTT by gelatinase-expressing tumors, the low affinity for MMP-2 and MMP-9 and in vivo instability make this in inadequate radioligand for in Vivo tumor evaluation.

In the past, red-shifted scintillants had only been integrated into microspheres, referred to as scintillation proximity assay (SPA) Imaging Beads(+). More recently, ImageFlashPlates(+) have been developed that emit light at 615 nm when exposed to beta-radiation. In this article, we report the establishment of peptide-protein binding assays using either streptavidin-coated ImageFlashPlates or Imaging Beads in a low volume 384-well format. In these assays, we employed a biotinylated peptide X and a [P-33]-phosphorylated protein Y as the binding partner. The FlashPlates required a washing step, the bead-filled microtiter plates (MTPs) needed a centrifugation step for optimal performance in the scintillation measurements. Both the peptide X-loaded FlashPlates and the beads displayed saturable binding of [P-33]-phosphorylated protein Y with a similar scintillation efficiency. A K-D value of about 30 nmol/l was measured using the bead-based assay. Due to the washing step in the FlashPlate experiment, approximately two-thirds of the [P-33]-phosphorylated protein Y were withdrawn from equilibrium binding. This resulted in correspondingly lower scintillation signals for the FlashPlate experiment. For this reason, the FlashPlate produced a Z' value of 0.64 that was lower than the Z' value of 0.87 for the beads. Using a reference inhibitor in a competition assay produced similar IC50 values for the bead-based assay as for the FlashPlate. Depending on the local automation environment either the centrifugation step for the beads or the washing step for the FlashPlates may be considered more or less of a challenge. Low volume 384-well high-throughput screening (HTS) applicable assay formats are achievable using either the ImageFlashPlates or the Imaging Beads.

Type II GnRH receptors (GnRH-Rs) show such regulation, but type I GnRH-Rs lack C-tails and are not rapidly desensitized or internalized. Here we show contrasting susceptibility of type I ( human and sheep) and II (Xenopus) GnRH-Rs to regulation by protein kinase C (PKC). When human (h) or Xenopus (X) GnRH-Rs were expressed using recombinant adenovirus, PKC activation increased radioligand binding to XGnRH-Rs but not to hGnRH-Rs. A dominant-negative dynamin mutant (K44A) inhibited internalization of XGnRH-Rs (but not hGnRH-Rs) without influencing PKC regulation of XGnRH-R binding. PKC activation increased the affinity of XGnRH-Rs for the type II GnRH ligand and increased effects of low concentrations of GnRH-II on the [Ca2+](i) but had no effect on type I ligand binding to hGnRH-Rs, sGnRH-Rs or XGnRH-Rs, or to chimeric receptors with the XGnRH-R C-tail added to a type I receptor. Binding of type II ligand to human or sheep receptors was also unaffected but was increased in the chimeras. Mutation of both PKC-phosphorylation consensus sites in the XGnRH-R tail did not prevent the PKC-mediated increases in binding or alter agonist-induced translocation of beta-arrestin2/green fluorescent protein or inhibition of inositol phosphate accumulation by beta-arrestin2/green fluorescent protein. Thus, it appears that there are two distinct active conformations of XGnRH-Rs (differing in affinity for type I and II ligands) and that these cells exhibit a novel form of inside-out signaling in which PKC feeds back to influence receptor affinity.

Methods and Results-Duloxetine was administered in a randomized, placebo-controlled study in 15 healthy volunteers. Plasma from duloxetine-treated subjects (ex vivo effect) dose-dependently decreased radioligand binding to human NET (maximum inhibition was 60%) (P = 0.02). The dose of intravenous tyramine required to raise systolic blood pressure by 30 mm Hg (PD30) increased dose-dependently with duloxetine and was significant at the end of the 120-mg/d dosage (P < 0.001). The plasma dihydoxyphenylglycol to NE (DHPG/NE) ratio was reduced significantly at 2 weeks of treatment with 80 mg/d duloxetine (11.3 at baseline, 3.4 at 240 mg/d, P<0.001). Plasma NE was significantly increased starting at 120 mg/d duloxetine. Urine results (corrected for 24-hour creatinine excretion) showed a dose-dependent change from the baseline urinary excretion for NE, DHPG, and the DHPG/NE ratio. The most sensitive measure, the DHPG/NE ratio, was significant at the 80-mg dose. Urinary NE excretion was significantly raised after 2 weeks of treatment with 80 mg/d duloxetine (P<0.001), the lowest dose used in the study. Conclusions-These findings suggest that the degree of NET blockade can be assessed with the plasma or urine DHPG/NE ratio and the pressor effect of tyramine. Also, the DHPG/NE ratio is more sensitive at the lower end of NET inhibition, whereas tyramine exhibits a linear relation, with NET inhibition commencing at a higher dose.

Deficits in explicit memory recall have been causally related to volume reductions of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. While stress-related glucocorticoid secretion appears involved in this apparent atrophy, there is also evidence for low plasma cortisol in PTSD. Prior exposure to trauma is an important risk factor for PTSD, suggesting a role for sensitisation. Using Sprague-Dawley rats, we studied the effects of a time-dependent sensitisation (TDS) model of stress on spatial memory deficits, I week post-stress, using the Morris water maze. Basal and 7-day post-stress plasma corticosterone levels were also determined. Due to the putative role of serotonin in anxiety and stress, and in the treatment of PTSD, hippocampal 5HT(1A) and prefrontal cortex 5HT(2A) radioligand binding studies were performed. TDS stress evoked a marked deficit in spatial memory on day 7 post TDS stress, coupled with significantly depressed plasma corticosterone levels. Cognitive and endocrine changes at day 7 post stress were associated with a significant increase in receptor density (B-max) and a significant decrease in receptor affinity (K-d) for hippocampal 5HT(1A) receptors. The B-max of prefrontal cortex 5HT(2A) receptors were unaffected, but K-d was significantly increased. We conclude that TDS stress evokes cognitive and endocrine changes characteristic of PTSD. Moreover, TDS stress induces diverse adaptive 5HT receptor changes in critical brain areas involved in emotion and memory that may underlie the effect of stress on cognitive function.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether increases in acetylcholine (ACh) levels induced by an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, physostigmine, inhibit in vivo binding of [I-123]5-iodo-3-(2(S)-2-azetidinyl-methoxy) pyridine (5-I-A-85380), a single photon emission computed tomography ligand for the high-affinity type nicotinic ACh receptor (nAChR). Baboons were used for seven studies with a bolus plus constant infusion equilibrium paradigm. After achieving equilibrium at 5 h, physostigmine (0.02 (n=1), 0.067 (n=3), and 0.2 (n=3) mg/kg) was administered intravenously and data were acquired for up to 8 h. To confirm equilibrium conditions, [I-123]5-I-A-85380 plasma levels were measured in four studies, including all studies with 0.2 mg/kg physostigmine. Prior to physostigmine administration, thalamic activities were stable, with changes of 1.1%/h or less, except in one study with a gradual increase of 4.2%/h. Thalamic activities were decreased by 15% in one study with 0.067 mg/kg and 14-17% in all studies with 0.2 mg/kg physostigmine administration (P=0.009). In these studies with 0.2 mg/kg physostigmine administration, [I-123]5-I-A-85380 plasma levels showed a transient or a sustained increase after physostigmine administration that would have increased thalamic activities. These results suggest that elevated ACh levels induced by physostigmine can effectively compete in vivo with [I-123]5-I-A-85380 binding at nAChRs. However, decreased thalamic activities could have been caused by other mechanisms, including internalization of the receptor with an associated decreased affinity for radioligand.

The compound consists of a 10-membered central azecine ring fused to indole on one and to benzene on the other side. To estimate the importance of the indole moiety in this highly active benz-indolo-azepine, the indole has to be removed and the "de-indolised" analog reinvestigated pharmacologically. Accordingly, we synthesized 3-benzazecines and in addition some homologuous 3-benzazonines. Methoxylated beta-phenylethyl-amines were treated with ethyl omega-bromo-butanoates and -pentanoates, respectively, to give the corresponding lactams which were cyclized (POCl3) and reduced (NaBH4), yielding the cis-annelated (X-ray) benzindolizines and -quinolizines. The 10- and 9-membered rings were obtained by cleavage of the central C-N bond, which was performed in the following two ways: Quarternisaion with methyl iodide and cleavage with sodium in liquid ammonia gave the NCH3 derivatives, reaction with benzyloxycarbonyl chloride/NaBH4 followed by catalytic debenzylation yielded a corresponding NH compound. Functional experiments on rat artery segments precontracted with ketanserin and radioligand binding experiments using human cloned dopamine receptor subtypes were conducted with all of the benzazecine and benzazonine derivatives. In contrast to the benz-indolo-compound LE 300 they did not show any significant affinity towards the D-1, D-2, D-4, and D-5 receptors and only moderate antagonistic activity at the 5-HT2A receptor. It can be concluded from our study that an indole moiety or at least another second aromatic system at the central azecine ring is part of the pharmacophore and thus essential for high biological activity.

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of nicotine on the levels of alpha7-nAChRs in rat brain, for which only partial information is available. Rats were infused with nicotine (3 mg/kg/day) or saline for 2 weeks and their brains processed for receptor autoradiography with [H-3] methyllycaconitine (MLA), a radioligand with nanomolar affinity for alpha7-nAChRs. In control rats binding was high in hippocampus, intermediate in cerebral cortex and hypothalamus, and low in striatum, thalamus and cerebellum. There was high correlation between the distribution of [H-3] MLA binding sites and alpha7 subunit mRNA (r = 0.816). With respect to saline-treated controls, nicotine-treated rats presented higher [H-3] nicotine binding in 11 out of 15 brain regions analysed (average increase 46 +/- 6%). In contrast, only four regions showed greater [H-3] MLA binding, among which the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and cingulate cortex ( mean increase 32 +/- 3%). No changes in alpha7 mRNA levels were observed after nicotine treatment. Similarly, there was no variation of alpha6 subunit transcript in the VTA, a region which may contain MLA-sensitive (non-alpha7)-alpha6*-nAChRs (Klink et al., 2001). In conclusion, nicotine increased [H-3] MLA binding, although to a smaller extent and in a more restricted regional pattern than [H-3] nicotine. The enhancement of binding was not paralleled by a significant change of a7 and a6 subunit transcription. Finally, the present results provide the first anatomical description of the distribution of [H-3] MLA binding sites in rat brain.

We hypothesized that this difference may arise from differential nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) density, the density supposedly being lower in the more sensitive cricopharyngeal muscle than in the resistant pharyngeal constrictor muscle. The aim of this study was to determine the density of nAChR in the main component of the upper esophageal sphincter, the cricopharyngeal muscle, and in the pharyngeal constrictor muscle. Methods: After approval by the institutional ethics committee and informed consent, muscle specimens were obtained from five patients undergoing surgery with laryngectomy for malignancies of the larynx or thyroid gland. None had received radiation therapy to the affected area. The nAChR from these tissue specimens were solubilized and incubated with I-125-alpha-bungarotoxin. The quantity of radioligand-receptor complex was measured by radioactive decay in a liquid scintillation counter. The receptor density was expressed as femtomoles per milligram of protein (fmol/mg protein). Results: The nAChR density was determined to 6.8 (3.5) fmol/mg protein (mean (SD)) in the cricopharyngeal muscle and 5.6 (2.1) fmol/mg protein in the pharyngeal constrictor muscle (P = 0.22). Although we could not find any difference in mean nAChR density, contrary to our hypothesis, the density in four of the five patients was higher in the cricopharyngeal muscle than in the pharyngeal constrictor muscle. Conclusion: Our results indicate that the density of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors is similar in the cricopharyngeal muscle and in the pharyngeal constrictor muscle. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor density, as determined by I-125-alpha-bungarotoxin assay, cannot explain the difference in response to neuromuscular blocking drugs between the investigated muscles.

Materials and methods Corpora cavernosa were obtained from Sprague-Dawley rats: total RNA and membrane proteins were extracted and cryostat sections prepared. The rat brain hypothalamus was used as a control for dopamine D1 and D2 receptors. The presence and expression of peripheral dopamine D1 and D2 receptor mRNAs in rat corpus cavernosa was assessed using reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and Northern blot hybridization using P-32-UTP-labelled RNA probes. Concurrently. corresponding proteins from D1 and D2 receptors were assayed and detected by a Western blotting technique. The anatomical location of dopamine D1 and D2 receptor mRNAs in rat penile tissues was identified by in situ hybridization using S-35-UTP-labelled RNA probes in cryostat sections. Immunohistochemical staining was used to locate peripheral dopamine D1 and D2 receptor proteins in rat corpora cavernosa. Results Dopamine D1 and D2 receptor gene expression was detected in rat corpora cavernosa. In situ hybridization signals for dopamine D1 and D2 receptor mRNAs were localized to corpus cavernosal tissues and dorsal vessels in the rat penis. Western blot analyses showed peripheral dopamine D1 and D2 receptor proteins in rat corpora cavernosa. Immunohistochemically, peripheral dopamine D1 and D2 receptor proteins were detected in dorsal nerves, dorsal vessels and corpus cavernosal smooth muscle of the rat penile tissues. Conclusions Peripheral dopamine D1 and D2 receptors are present in the corpora cavernosa of rats. The functional significance of these receptors and signal transduction pathways in modulating the vascular tone of the penis warrants further investigation.

Adrenomedullin (ADM) exerts antiproliferative effects on rat mesangial cells in vitro and, therefore is a possible renoprotective agent. In contrast, nitric oxide (NO) is capable of exerting both cytoprotective and cytotoxic actions. It was the objective of the present study to examine whether NO stimulates the ADM system. Methods. Rat mesangial cells were incubated with the NO donors GSNO and SNAP, the guanylate cyclase inhibitor ODQ, and the cGMP analog 8-bromo-cGMP. ADM radioligand binding, ADM-induced intracellular cAMP-accumulation (radioimmunoassay) and ADM receptor gene expression (Taq-Man real time PCR) were measured. Results, Twenty-four hour treatment of mesangial cells with GSNO and SNAP (100 mumol/L each) increased the maximal binding of ADM to its receptor from 52% +/- 4% to 101% +/- 4% (P < 0.001) and 81% +/- 2% (P < 0.001), respectively. GSNO, SNAP (both 100 mumol/L) and 8-bromo-cGMP (50 mumol/L) increased EC50 from 9.9 X 10(-8) to 7.0 X 10(-10), 4.8 X 10(-10), 1.1 X 10(-9), respectively. In contrast, combined pretreatment with GSNO (100 mumol/L) and ODQ (100 mumol/L) reduced EC50 to values similar to the control cells (2.4 X 10(-8)). In contrast, ADM receptor gene expression was reduced significantly by different concentrations of GSNO, SNAP, and by 50 mumol/L 8-bromo-cGMP, but not by 8-bromo-cAMP. Conclusions. NO increases ADM signal transduction via a cGMP dependent pathway. This effect is caused, at least in part, by an increase in ADM receptor availability and is counteracted in a feedback manner on the mRNA level. This mechanism might direct the impact of NO on mesangial cell function toward cytoprotection.

The secondary purpose was to determine the impact of volumetric parameter responses to overall survival. Methods PSMA tumor volumes (PSMA-TV) and tumor lesion PSMA expressions (TL-PSMA) were calculated with a semi-automatic program on Ga-68 PSMA I&T PET/CT images that were obtained before and after Lu-177 PSMA I&T therapies with 19 patients. The median overall survival was compared with PSMA-TV, TL-PSMA, SUVmax, PSA, and alteration in PERCIST criteria. Results PSMA-TV values were decreased in 12 patients (63%), and TL-PSMA values were decreased in 15 patients (79%) following the therapy. The SUVmax and the PSA values were also decreased in 14 (74%) and 10 (53%) patients, respectively. The complete remission (CR) was observed in two patients (10%). The partial response (PR) and progressive disease were observed in 6 (32%) and 11 (58%) patients, respectively, according to PRECIST criteria. The survival rates were statistically significant in patients with a decrease in PSMA-TV and TL-PSMA values than patients without any decrease (p 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively). However, the survival rates did not differ in responders (PR or CR) and non-responders according to the PERCIST criteria (p 0.232). The survival rates did not also differ in responders and non-responders according to the SUVmax and PSA values (p 0.140, p 0.206, respectively). Conclusions Molecular and volumetric parameters are beneficial in the assessment of Lu-177 PSMA I&T therapy response. Although the number of patients is small, TL-PSMA response, which includes both the tumor volume and PSMA expression in tumor, may be considered as the most valuable parameter for the evaluation of the therapy response and the prediction of survival rate.

The success of imaging is closely related to sufficient uptake of the radiotracer in malignant tissue and for this sufficient biological half-life, particularly in the bloodstream, is mandatory. Fast enzymatic degradation during circulation leading to insufficient imaging abilities of peptide-based radioligands remains a major issue. The design of multimeric constructs, bearing multiple targeting moieties, has been widely applied to improve target interaction. This concept may also be applied to prolong the biological half-life of peptide-based radiopharmaceuticals as enzymatic degradation can result in formation of metabolites still capable to interact with the target binding site. In this study we aimed to identify such metabolites and therefore we utilized the siderophore-based bifunctional chelator fusarinine C (FSC) for the design of novel mono-and multimeric constructs, bearing minigastrin (MG) analogues as targeting moieties to address cholecystokinin-2 receptors (CCK2R) which are overexpressed in a variety of cancerous diseases and are well known for fast enzymatic degradation, particularly for truncated des-(Glu) 5-MG members, such as MG11. FSC-based imaging probes were radiolabelled with gallium-68 and characterized in vitro (logD, protein binding, affinity and cell-uptake studies, stability and metabolite studies, as well as generation of corresponding metabolites by artificial enzymatic degradation) and in vivo (biodistribution in A431-CCK2R/A431-mock tumour xenografted BALB/c nude mice and stability in blood of living BALB/c mice and analysis of corresponding organ homogenates and urine to identify degradation products). In summary, multimerization was accompanied by partial improvement towards targeting abilities. Identified metabolites formed by artificial enzymatic cleavage of trimeric FSC-MG conjugates in vitro contained intact binding sequences for the receptor. Furthermore, the 68 Ga-labelled trimers exhibiting increasing uptake of radioligand in tumour tissue over time and improved in vivo stability in blood samples of living animals of the trimers compared to corresponding mono-and dimers, strongly supporting our hypothesis.

Furthermore, the oxytocin system appears as a possible therapeutic target in autism spectrum disorders and other psychiatric troubles, justifying current pharmacological researches. Since no specific PET radioligand is currently available to image OTR in the brain, the aim of this study was to radiolabel the specific OTR antagonist PF-3274167 and to evaluate [C-11]PF-3274167 as a potential PET tracer for OTR in rat brains. Methods: [C-11]PF-3274167 was prepared via the O-methylation of its desmethyl precursor with [C-11]methyl iodide. The lipophilicity of the radioactive compound was evaluated by measuring the n-octanol-buffer partition coefficient (logD). Autoradiography experiments were performed on rat brain tissue to evaluate the in vitro distribution of the [C-11]PF-3274167. MicroPET experiments were conducted with and without pre-injection of ciclosporin in order to evaluate the influence of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) on the brain uptake. Results: [C-11]PF-3274167 was synthesized with high radiochemical and chemical purities (>95%) and good specific activity. The measured logD was 1.93. In vitro, [C-11]PF-3274167 did not show any evidence of specific binding to OTR. PET imaging showed that [C-11]PF-3274167 uptake in rat brain was very low in basal conditions but increased significantly after the administration of ciclosporin, suggesting that it is a substrate of the P-gp. In the ciclosporin-pre-injected rat, however, [C-11]PF-3274167 distribution did not match with the known distribution of OTR in rats. Conclusion: [C-11]PF-3274167 is not a suitable tracer for imaging of OTR in rat brain, probably because of a too low affinity for this receptor in addition to a poor brain penetration.

Evidence for MOR on cell membrane, sarcoplasmatic reticulum and mitochondria in left ventricular myocardium in rats	HEART AND VESSELS			English	Article						Aortocaval fistula; Heart failure; Mu opioid receptor; POMC; Localization; Mitochondria	DELTA-OPIOID RECEPTORS; K-ATP CHANNELS; INFLAMMATORY PAIN; MORPHINE MIMICS; HEART-FAILURE; MESSENGER-RNA; MU; MYOCYTES; EXPRESSION; TISSUE	Cardiac function is one important determinant to maintain tissue oxygenation and is thus highly regulated. In this context, it is interesting that centrally mediated opioidergic influence on cardiac function has long been known. Only recently, KOR and DOR have been found to be expressed in healthy left ventricular myocardium in rats and colocalized with parts of the excitation-contraction-coupling system. However, several comments in literature exist doubting the existence of MOR in cardiac tissue. We, therefore, aimed to detect MOR in rat left ventricular cardiomyocytes, and to evaluate whether MOR and POMC are regulated during heart failure. After IRB approval, heart failure was induced using a modified infrarenal aortocaval fistula (ACF) in male Wistar rats. All rats of the control and ACF group were characterized by their morphometrics and hemodynamics and the existence of MOR and POMC was investigated by means of radioligand binding, double immunofluorescence confocal analysis, RT-PCR and Western blot. Membrane MOR selective binding sites were detected in the left ventricular myocardium, however, they were lower in abundance than KOR- and DOR-specific binding sites and B (max) of MOR could not be determined. In left ventricular cardiomyocytes, MOR colocalized with parts of the excitation-coupling mechanism, e.g., Ca(v)1.2 of the cell membrane and invaginated T-tubules as well as the ryanodine receptor of the sarcoplasmatic reticulum. More importantly, MOR strongly colocalized with mitochondria of left ventricular cardiomyocytes. Volume overload was not associated with an altered expression of MOR and POMC on both mRNA and protein level. These findings provide evidence for the existence of MOR on the cell membrane, sarcoplasmatic reticulum and mitochondria in left ventricular cardiomyocytes in rats. However, heart failure does not result in an altered expression of the cardiac MOR-opioid system. Thus, MOR agonist treatment-commonly used in the clinical setting-might directly affect cardiac function, which needs to be evaluated in greater detail in the near future.

Nuclear medical imaging is one of the useful techniques for noninvasive evaluation of physiological and pathological function in living subjects. Recent progress in nuclear medical imaging modalities enables the clear visualization of the organs of small rodents. Thus, translational research using nuclear medical imaging in transgenic mice has become possible and helps to elucidate human disease pathology. However, imaging of alpha 4 beta 2 nAChRs in the mouse brain has not yet been performed. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with 5-[I-123]iodo-3-[2(S)-azetidinylmethoxy]pyridine ([I-123]5IA) for evaluating alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR availability in the mouse brain. Methods: A 60-min dynamic SPECT imaging session of alpha 4 beta 2 nAChRs in the mouse brain was performed. The regional distribution of radioactivity in the SPECT images was compared to the density of alpha 4 beta 2 nAChRs measured in an identical mouse. Alteration of nAChR density in the brains of Tg2576 mice was also evaluated. Results: The mouse brain was clearly visualized by [I-123]5IA-SPECT and probe accumulation was significantly inhibited by pretreatment with (-)-nicotine. The regional distribution of radioactivity in SPECT images showed a significant positive correlation with alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR density measured in an identical mouse brain. Moreover, [I-123]5IA-SPECT was able to detect the up-regulation of alpha 4 beta 2 nAChRs in the brains of Tg2576 transgenic mice. Conclusions: [I-123]5IA-SPECT imaging would be a promising tool for evaluating alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR availability in the mouse brain and may be useful in translational research focused on nAChR-related diseases.

Human Kinetic Modeling of the 5HT6 PET Radioligand <SUP>11</SUP>C-GSK215083 and Its Utility for Determining Occupancy at Both 5HT6 and 5HT2A Receptors by SB742457 as a Potential Therapeutic Mechanism of Action in Alzheimer Disease	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						5HT6; human kinetic modeling; C-11-GSK215083; SB742457; Alzheimer's disease	COGNITIVE FUNCTION; 5-HT6 RECEPTOR; RISPERIDONE; ANTAGONIST; SB-742457; BINDING; LIGAND; BRAIN	Antagonism of 5-hydroxytrypamine-6 (5HT6) receptors is associated with procognitive effects in preclinical species, suggesting a therapeutic potential for this mechanism in Alzheimer disease (AD) and other cognitive diseases. In a phase 2 dose study, SB742457, a novel 5HT6 antagonist, showed increasing procognitive effects in patients with AD as the dose increased, with a procognitive signal in AD patients at a dose of 35 mg/d superior to the other doses tested (5 and 15 mg/d). Methods: In this article, we describe the quantification and pharmacologic selectivity of a new 5HT6 PET ligand (C-11-GSK215083) in healthy volunteers and its use to measure occupancies achieved at various doses of SB742457. Results: Kinetic analysis of C-11-GSK215083 uptake in the human brain demonstrated the multilinear model, MA2, to represent the method of choice when a blood input was available and the full tissue reference method when no input was available. Pharmacologic dissection of the in vivo C-11-GSK215083-specific binding showed the ligand bound mostly the 5HT6 in the striatum (blocked by SB742457 but not by the selective 5-hydroxytryptamine-2A (5HT2A) antagonist ketanserin) and the 5HT2A in the frontal cortex (blocked by both ketanserin and SB742457). Repeated administration of SB742457 (3, 15, and 35 mg/d) saturated the 5HT6 receptors at all doses. In the cortex, 5HT2A receptor occupancy was 24% +/- 6% (3 mg/d), 35% +/- 4% (15 mg/d), and 58% +/- 19% (35 mg/d; mean +/- SD), suggesting a progressive engagement of 5HT2A as the dose increased. Conclusion: Collectively, these data support the use of C-11-GSK215083 as a 5HT6 clinical imaging tool and suggest that blocking both the 5HT6 and the 5HT2A receptors may be required for the optimal therapeutic action of SB742457 in AD.

This study investigated the biodistribution of a serotonin transporter imaging agent, N,N-dimethyl-2-(2-amino-4-F-18-fluorophenylthio)benzylamine (4-[F-18]-ADAM), in nonhuman primate brain using positron emission tomography (PET). Methods: Six and four Macaca cyclopis monkeys were used to determine the transit time (i.e., time necessary to reach biodistribution equilibrium) and the reproducibility of 4-[F-18]-ADAM biodistribution in the brain, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of 4-[F-18]-ADAM binding to SERT were evaluated in one monkey challenged with different doses of fluoxetine and one monkey treated with 3,4-methylendioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). Dynamic PET imaging was performed for 3 h after 4-[F-18]-ADAM intravenous bolus injection. The specific uptake ratios (SURs) in the midbrain (MB), thalamus (TH), striatum (ST) and frontal cortex (FC) were calculated. Results: The distribution of 4-[F-18]-ADAM reached equilibrium 120-150 min after injection. The mean SURs were 2.49 +/- 0.13 in MB, 1.59 +/- 0.17 in TH, 1.35 +/- 0.06 in ST and 0.34 +/- 0.03 in FC, and the minimum variability was shown 120-150 min after 4-[F-18]-ADAM injection. Using SURs and intraclass coefficient of correlation, the test/retest variability was under 8% and above 0.8, respectively, in SERT-rich areas. Challenge with fluoxetin (0.75-2 mg) dose-dependently inhibited the SURs in various brain regions. 4-[F-18]-ADAM binding was markedly reduced in the brain of an MDMA-treated monkey compared to that in brains of normal controls. Conclusion: 4-[F-18]-ADAM appears to be a highly selective radioligand for imaging SERT in monkey brain. (C) 2012 Elsevier Lnc. All rights reserved.

Previous structureactivity relationship (SAR) analysis has suggested that the 3-position may be involved in receptor recognition and agonist activity. The goal of the present study was to develop CB1-selective compounds and explore further the SAR of 3-substitution on the rimonabant template. 3-Substituted analogs with benzyl and alkyl amino, dihydrooxazole, and oxazole moieties were synthesized and evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Several notable patterns emerged. First, most of the analogs exhibited CB1 selectivity, with many lacking affinity for the CB2 receptor. Affinity tended to be better when [H-3]5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1(2,4-dichloro-phenyl)-4-methyl-N-(piperidin-1-yl)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide (SR141716), rather than [H-3](-)-cis-3-[2-hydroxy-4(1,1-dimethyl-heptyl)phenyl]-trans-4-(3-hydroxy-propyl) cyclohexanol (CP55,940), was used as the binding radioligand. Second, many of the analogs produced an agonist-like profile of effects in mice (i.e., suppression of activity, antinociception, hypothermia, and immobility); however, their potencies were not well correlated with their CB1 binding affinities. Further assessment of selected analogs showed that none were effective antagonists of the effects of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol in mice, their agonist-like effects were not blocked by rimonabant, they were active in vivo in CB1 (-/-) mice, and they failed to stimulate guanosine-5'-O-(3-[S-35] thio)-triphosphate binding. Several analogs were inverse agonists in the latter assay. Together, these results suggest that this series of 3-substituted pyrazole analogs represent a novel class of CB1-selective cannabinoids that produce agonist-like effects in mice through a non-CB1, non-CB2 mechanism.

In contrast, [H-3]CHF5407 dissociated quickly from hM2 receptors (t(1/2) = 31 min), whereas [H-3]tiotropium dissociated slowly from both hM3 (t(1/2) = 163 min) and hM2 receptor (t(1/2) = 297 min). In the guinea pig isolated trachea and human isolated bronchus, CHF5407 produced a potent (pIC(50) = 9.0-9.6) and longlasting (up to 24 h) inhibition of M3 receptor-mediated contractile responses to carbachol. In the guinea pig electrically driven left atrium, the M2 receptor-mediated inhibitory response to carbachol was recovered more quickly in CHF5407-pretreated than in tiotropium-pretreated preparations. CHF5407, administered intratracheally to anesthetized guinea pigs, potently inhibited acetylcholine (Ach)-induced bronchoconstriction with an ED50 value of 0.15 nmol/kg. The effect was sustained over a period of 24 h, with a residual 57% inhibition 48 h after antagonist administration at 1 nmol/kg. In conscious guinea pigs, inhaled CHF5407 inhibited Ach-induced bronchoconstriction for at least 24 h as did tiotropium at similar dosages. Cardiovascular parameters in anesthetized guinea pigs were not significantly changed by CHF5407, up to 100 nmol/kg i.v. and up to 1000 nmol/kg i.t. In conclusion, CHF5407 shows a prolonged antibronchospastic activity both in vitro and in vivo, caused by a very slow dissociation from M3 receptors. In contrast, CHF5407 is markedly short-acting at M2 receptors, a behavior not shared by tiotropium.	[Villetti, G.; Pastore, F.; Bergamaschi, M.; Bassani, F.; Bolzoni, P.

In this study, we characterized the pharmacological profile of the novel compound N'-[(3Z)-1-(1-hexyl)-2-oxo-1,2-dihydro-3H-indol-3-ylidene]benzohydrazide (MDA19), a CB2 agonist. METHODS: We used radioligand binding assays and multiple in vitro functional assays at human and rat CB2 and CB2 receptors. The effects of MDA19 in reversing neuropathic pain were assessed in various neuropathic pain models in rats and in CB2+/+ and CB2-/- mice. RESULTS: MDA19 displayed 4-fold-higher affinity at the human CB2 than at the human CB, receptor (K-i = 43.3 +/- 10.3 vs 162.4 +/- 7.6 nM) and nearly 70-fold-higher affinity at the rat CB2 than at the rat CB1 receptor (K-i = 16.3 +/- 2.1 vs 1130 +/- 574 nM). In guanosine triphosphate (GTP)gamma[S-35] functional assays, MDA19 behaved as an agonist at the human CB, and CB2 receptors and at the rat CB1 receptor but as an inverse agonist at the rat CB2 receptor. In 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) assays, MDA19 behaved as an agonist at the rat CB1 receptor and exhibited no functional activity at the rat CB2 receptor. In extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 activation assays, MDA19 behaved as an agonist at the rat CB2 receptor. MDA19 attenuated tactile allodynia produced by spinal nerve ligation or paclitaxel in a dose-related manner in rats and CB2+/+ mice but not in CB2-/- mice, indicating that CB2 receptors mediated the effects of MDA19. MDA19 did not affect rat locomotor activity. CONCLUSIONS: We found that MDA19 exhibited a distinctive in vitro functional profile at rat CB2 receptors and behaved as a CB1/CB2 agonist in vivo, characteristics of a protean agonist. MDA19 has potential for alleviating neuropathic pain without producing adverse effects in the central nervous system.

The 3 alpha 1-AR subtypes, alpha 1A, alpha 1B, and alpha 1D, have distinct physiological roles in mouse heart, but very little is known about alpha 1 subtypes in human heart. Here, we test the hypothesis that the alpha 1A and alpha 1B subtypes are present in human myocardium, similar to the mouse, and are not downregulated in heart failure. Methods and Results-Hearts from transplant recipients and unused donors were failing (n = 12; mean ejection fraction, 24%) or nonfailing (n = 9; mean ejection fraction, 59%) and similar in age (approximate to 44 years) and sex (approximate to 70% male). We measured the alpha 1-AR subtypes in multiple regions of both ventricles by quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and radioligand binding. All 3 alpha 1-AR subtype mRNAs were present, and alpha 1A mRNA was most abundant (approximate to 65% of total alpha 1-AR mRNA). However, only alpha 1A and alpha 1B binding were present, and the alpha 1B was most abundant (60% of total). In failing hearts, alpha 1A and alpha 1B binding was not downregulated, in contrast with beta 1-ARs. Conclusions-Our data show for the first time that the alpha 1A and alpha 1B subtypes are both present in human myocardium, but alpha 1D binding is not, and the alpha 1 subtypes are not downregulated in heart failure. Because alpha 1 subtypes in the human heart are similar to those in the mouse, where adaptive and protective effects of alpha 1 subtypes are most convincing, it might become feasible to treat heart failure with a drug targeting the alpha 1A and/or alpha 1B.

However, the use of HRRT for neuroimaging applications still needs to be fully assessed. The present study aimed at evaluating the HRRT for measurement of the dopamine transporter (DAT) binding to validate its quantification and explore the gain induced by the increased spatial resolution in comparison with conventional PET scanners. Methods: Fifteen and 11 healthy subjects were examined using the selective DAT radioligand C-11-PE21 with HRRT and HR+ scanners, respectively. Quantification of the DAT binding was assessed by the calculation of binding potential (BP) values using the simplified reference tissue model in anatomic regions of interest (ROIs) defined on the dorsal striaturn and in a standardized ROI defined on the midbrain. Results: Quantification of C-11-PE21 binding to the DAT measured in the midbrain and striaturn with both scanners at the same spatial resolution (smoothed HRRT images) exhibited similar BP values and intersubject variability, thus validating the quantification of DAT binding on the HRRT. For age-paired comparison, BID values of subjects examined with HRRT were significantly higher than those of the subjects examined with HR+. The increase ranged from 29% in the cauclate and 35% in the putamen to 92% in the midbrain. The decline in DAT binding with age in the striaturn was in good agreement between both scanners and literature, whereas no significant decrease in DAT binding with age was observed in the midbrain with either HRRT or HR+. Conclusion: HRRT allows quantitative measurements of neurotransmission processes in small brain nuclei and allows recovering higher values as compared with coarser spatial resolution PET scanners. H ig h -spatial -resolution PET appears promising for a more accurate detection of neurobiologic modifications and also for the exploration of subtle modifications in small and complex brain structures largely affected by the partial-volume effect.

The authors hypothesized that halothane does not affect isoproterenol-promoted guanosine nucleotide exchange at G alpha(s) and hence would not affect isoproterenol-induced relaxation of airway smooth muscle. Methods: Halothane effects on isoproterenol-induced inhibition of calcium sensitivity were measured in permeabilized porcine airway smooth muscle. G alpha(s) nucleotide exchange was measured in crude membranes prepared from COS-7 cells transfected to transiently coexpress the human beta(1) or beta(2) receptor each with human short G alpha(s). A radioactive, northydrolyzable analog of GTP, [(35)S]GTP gamma S, was used as the reporter for nucleotide exchange at G alpha(s). Results: Halothane (0.75 mM, approximately 2.8 minimum alveolar concentration [MAC] in pigs) did not affect isoproterenol-induced inhibition of calcium sensitivity. Isoproterenol caused a time- and concentration-dependent increase in Gas nucleotide exchange. Halothane, even at concentrations of 1.5 mM (approximately 5.6 MAC), had no effect on basal G alpha(s) nucleotide exchange in the absence of isoproterenol, whereas halothane inhibited isoproterenol-promoted G alpha(s) nucleotide exchange in both the beta(1)-G alpha(s) and beta(2)-G alpha(s) expressing membranes. However, the effect was significantly greater on beta 1-G alpha(s) coupling compared with beta(2)-G alpha(s) coupling, with no effect on beta(2)-G alpha(s) coupling at 2.8 MAC halothane. Conclusion: Halothane does not inhibit the biochemical coupling between the beta(2) receptor and G alpha(s) and hence does not affect the inhibition of calcium sensitivity induced by isoproterenol. Therefore, halothane should not affect the efficacy of beta(2) agonists, as suggested by studies of in vivo animal models of asthma.

ARD-353 was characterized as having delta receptor selectivity using radioligand binding and had no apparent selectivity between delta receptor subtypes as determined by [ H-3] cyclic [ D-Pen(2), D-Pen(5)] enkephalin ( delta(1)) and [ H-3] Deltorphin II ( delta(2)) competition binding. ARD-353 also showed selective delta receptor agonist activity in mouse-isolated vas deferens. There was no evidence of any seizure-like convulsions when ARD-353 was administered to mice either i.v. or p.o., implying minimal penetration of the blood-brain barrier. ARD-353 decreased infarct size in a left anterior descending coronary artery ( LAD) occlusion model of myocardial infarction. In animals pretreated with ARD-353 ( i.v.) and then subjected to 30 min of LAD occlusion followed by 90 min of reperfusion, infarct size was reduced in a dose-dependent manner compared with vehicle-treated controls. The effects of ARD-353 on infarct size were blocked by the delta(1)-opioid selective antagonist 7-benzylidenenaltrexone, indicating a significant role for the delta(1)-opioid receptor in the cardioprotective mechanism of ARD-353. ARD-353 ( 0.3 mg/kg i.v.) produced significant protection when administered 5 min and 12 and 48 h before ischemic insult or when given immediately after the ischemic insult ( at the start of reperfusion). Given the lack of central nervous system effects and beneficial efficacy in the rat model of myocardial ischemia, it is felt that ARD-353 is the first nonpeptide delta-receptor agonist with true potential for clinical use before surgically induced ischemia or in an emergency setting.

Here, we used human recombinant receptors to determine the relative affinity of cyamemazine for serotonin and dopamine receptor subtypes. In addition, cyamemazine was tested in other brain receptor types and subtypes which are considered to mediate central nervous systems effects of drugs. Hence, cyamemazine affinity was determined in human recombinant receptors expressed in CHO cells (hD(2), hD(3), and hD(4.4) receptors, h5-HT1A, h5-HT2A, h5-H-TC, and h5-HT7, and hM(1), hM(2), hM(3), hM(4), and hM(5) receptors), L-cells (hD(1) receptor), and HEK-293 cells (h5-HT3 receptors) or natively present in N1E-115 cells (5-HT3 receptors) or in rat cerebral cortex (non-specific alpha(1)- and alpha(1)-adrenoceptors, GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors, H-3 histamine receptors), and guinea-pig cerebellum (H-1 central and H-2 histamine receptors) membranes. Similarly to atypical antipsychotics, cyamemazine exhibited high affinity for: (i) h5-HT2A receptors (K-i = 1.5 +/- 0.7 nM, mean +/- SEM, N = 3) and this was four times higher than for hD(2) receptors (K-i = 5.8 +/- 0.8 nM), (ii) h5-HT2C receptors (K-i = 11.8 +/- 2.2 nM), and (iii) 5-HT7 receptors (K-i = 22 nM). Conversely, cyamemazine exhibited very low affinity for h5-HT3 receptors (K-i = 2.9 +/- 0.4 muM). In conclusion, similarly to atypical antipsychotic agents, cyamemazine, possesses high affinity for h5-HT2A, h5-HT2C, and h5-HT7 receptors, a feature which can explain its low propensity to cause extrapyramidal adverse reactions in clinical practice. The high affinity for h5-HT2C receptors, but not for h5-HT3 receptors, can account for the anxiolyfic activity of cyamemazine in human subjects. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

As compared to wild-type littermates, homozygous mice lacking sst(2) receptors showed a 52% reduction in EEG ictal activity induced by intrahippocampal injection of 30 ng kainic acid (P < 0.05). The number of behavioural tonic-clonic seizures was reduced by 50% (P < 0.01) and the time to onset of seizures was doubled on average (P < 0.05). Seizure-associated neurodegeneration was found in the injected hippocampus (CA1, CA3 and hilar interneurons) and sporadically in the ipsilateral latero-dorsal thalamus. This occurred to a similar extent in wild-type and sst(2) knock-out mice. Intrahippocampal injection of three selective sst(2) receptor agonists in wild-type mice (Octreotide, BIM 23120 and L-779976, 1.5-6.0 nmol) did not affect kainate seizures while the same compounds significantly reduced seizures in rats. L-803087 (5 nmol), a selective sst(4) receptor agonist, doubled seizure activity in wild-type mice on average. Interestingly, this effect was blocked by 3 nmol octreotide. It was determined, in both radioligand binding and cAMP accumulation, that octreotide had no direct agonist or antagonist action at mouse sst(4) receptors expressed in CCl39 cells, up to micromolar concentrations. In hippocampal slices from wild-type mice, octreotide (2 mum) did not modify AMPA-mediated synaptic responses while facilitation occurred with L-803087 (2 mum). Similarly to what was observed in seizures, the effect of L-803087 was reduced by octreotide. In hippocampal slices from sst(2) knock-out mice, both octreotide and L-803087 were ineffective on synaptic responses. Our findings show that, unlike in rats, sst(2) receptors in mice do not mediate anticonvulsant effects. Moreover, stimulation of sst(4) receptors in the hippocampus of wild-type mice induced excitatory effects which appeared to depend on the presence of sst(2) subtypes, suggesting these receptors are functionally coupled.

Recently, however, an immortalized human fetal aortic vascular smooth muscle cell line (FLTR) was generated using an amphotropic recombinant retroviral construct containing the E6/E7 open reading frames of the human papillomavirus type 16. Radioligand binding studies were undertaken to determine whether angiotensin II (Ang II) receptors were expressed on these cells. FLTR cell membranes were shown to express high-affinity Ang II receptors having a B(max) value of 324 +/- 43 fmol/mg protein and a K(d) of 0.36 +/-0.1 nM. In both membranes and intact cells, Ang II, Ang III and the selective AT(1)R antagonist, Losartan, all had a high affinity for the receptor, suggesting that FLTR cells express the AT(1)R subtype. The expression of the hAT(1)R was validated by Northern and Western blot and RT-PCR experiments. In intact FLTR cells, Ang II (100 nM) evoked an increase in intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) and induced hyperplasia. Additionally, our results demonstrated that FLTR cells were readily transfected, and hAT(1)R promoter luciferase constructs exhibited robust promoter activity (i.e. similar to 22-fold increase over pGL3-Basic only). Finally, our results demonstrated that the hAT(1)R gene is differentially regulated in FLTR cells vs. H295-R cells, a human adrenocarcinoma cell line that also abundantly expresses the AT(1)R. Taken together, our results suggest that FLTR cells express functional AT(1)Rs and will provide an excellent model system in which to investigate hAT(1)R gene regulation.

We have characterized for the first time the binding of human [I-125-His(9)]-ghrelin to normal human and rat tissue and demonstrated expression of this 'orphan' receptor that has previously been predicted to exist from mRNA. Furthermore, we have discovered that ghrelin density is significantly increased in atherosclerosis. 2 [I-125-His(9)]-Ghrelin bound to non-diseased human heart (left ventricle) with an association rate constant (k(obs)) of 0.16 +/- 0.004 min(-1), a dissociation rate constant of 0.068 +/- 0.0005 min(-1) (kinetically derived K-D of 0.1 nM; n=5 individuals +/- s.e.mean), a K-D of 0.43 +/- 0.08 nM and B-max of 7.8+/-0.9 fmol mg(-1) protein (n=6 individual +/- s.e.mean). 3 Specific [I-125-His(9)]-ghrelin binding was to the human vasculature including aorta, coronary, pulmonary, arcuate arteries in the kidney and saphenous veins. In rat tissues, binding sites were also localized to the vasculature in peripheral tissues as well as the granular layer of the cerebellum in the CNS, 4 [I-125-His(9)]-Ghrelin binding was significantly up-regulated (3-4 fold) in both atherosclerotic coronary arteries and saphenous vein grafts with advanced intimal thickening, compared with normal vessels (P<0.05). 5 Our results suggest that (fie native receptor for [I-125-His(9)]-ghrelin may be widely distributed in the human cardiovascular system. Furthermore, changes in the density of this proposed ghrelin receptor implicates this new transmitter system in the development of atherosclerosis and may therefore represent a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of cardiovascular disease.

Unhabituated rats were pretreated with the drugs once, prior to a first exposure to the open field, and their behavior was recorded both during this test and during a second trial 24 h later. It has been hypothesized that the decrease in exploratory activity observed during the second test session may be considered an adaptive reaction to the first day aversive experience (neophobia). If so. a selective modulation of 5-HT and GABA systems activity during the test could bring about significant changes in animal behavior on the retest. Buspirone at the lowest dose of 0.3 mg/kg revealed anxiolytic-like properties on the first day, whereas the action of diazepam and zolpidem was modulated by the dose-related sedative effect. At the dose of 2.4 mg/kg buspirone elicited delayed in time anxiolytic-like action, i.e., produced the antithigmotactic effect during the retrial 24 h later. Diazepam and zolpidem failed to exhibit similar profile of action. Autoradiography of [H-3]muscimol binding after pretreatment of rats with buspirone showed a significant increase in the selective radioligand binding within the frontal cortex and a similar, near-significant tendency in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. The behavioral data validate buspirone as important drug for the treatment of anxiety disorders, devoid of disruptive influence on motor and cognitive processes. The open field test, as modified by us, appeared sensitive in distinguishing the behavioral profiles of action of different anxiolytic compounds, including 5-HT1A receptor agonist. The present results support the assumption that reduced turnover of 5-HT due to stimulation of 5-HT1A autoreceptors, may bring about changes in GABA(A) receptor system activity, in some brain structures, leading to the anxiolytic effect.

The effect of eating on the uptake of PSMA ligands in the salivary glands	EJNMMI RESEARCH			English	Article						Salivary glands; Toxicity; PSMA; Radionuclide therapy; Stimulation	PROSTATE-CANCER; RADIOIODINE THERAPY; RADIOLIGAND THERAPY; PAROTID-GLANDS; EXPRESSION; DOSIMETRY; FLOW	Rationale PSMA-directed therapy for metastatic prostate cancer is gaining adoption as a treatment option. However, accumulation of Lu-177/Ac-225-PSMA in the salivary glands remains a problem, with risk of dose-limiting xerostomia and potentially severe effect on the quality of life. Gustatory stimulation is an approach that has commonly been used in radioactive iodine therapy to reduce accumulation in the salivary glands. However, based on theoretical differences in biodistribution, it was hypothesized that this could potentially lead to adverse increased toxicity for PSMA-ligand therapy. The primary objective of this work was to determine if gustatory stimulation by eating an assortment of sweet/fatty/acidic foods during the biodistribution phase of [F-18]DCFPyl could result in a clinically relevant (> 30%) change in the uptake of the tracer in the salivary glands. Methods 10 patients who already received a whole-body [F-18]DCFPyl PET/CT scan for evaluation of prostate cancer, underwent a repeat (intervention) PET/CT scan within a month of the first (control) scan. During the intervention scan, patients chose from an assortment of sweet/fatty/acidic foods, which they then chewed and swallowed for a period of time starting 1 min before tracer administration to 10 min thereafter. Data from both scans were analyzed by placing VOIs on the major salivary glands and segmenting them using relative thresholds. Results A slight increase in PSMA uptake in the parotid glands was observed on the intervention scan when compared to the baseline scan (+ 7.1% SULmean and + 9.2% SULmax, p < 0.05). No significant difference in PSMA uptake in the submandibular glands was seen. Conclusions Eating only slightly increases uptake of [F-18]DCFPyl in the parotid glands. We nonetheless recommend refraining from gustatory stimulation during the administration and early biodistribution phase of radionuclide therapy with PSMA-ligands to reduce the risk of avoidable additional toxicity.

This study compares the mechanisms of action of 2-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)ethanamine (25D-NBOMe), 2-(4-ethy1-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)ethanamine (25E-NBOMe), 2-(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-(2methoxybenzyl)ethanamine (25H-NBOMe), 2-(((4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethyl)amino)methyl)phenol (25I-NBOH); and 2-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)ethanamine) (25N-NBOMe) with hallucinogens and stimulants. Mammalian cells heterologously expressing 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B or 5-HT2C receptors, or dopamine, serotonin or norepinephrine transporters (DAT, SERT and NET, respectively) were used to assess drug affinities at radioligand binding sites. Potencies and efficacies were determined using [S-35]GTP gamma S binding assays (5-HT1A), inositol-phosphate accumulation assays (5-HT2A, 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C), and uptake and release assays (transporters). The substituted phenethylamines were very low potency and low efficacy agonists at the 5-HT1A receptor. 25D-NBOMe, 25E-NBOMe, 25H-NBOMe, 25I-NBOH and 25N-NBOMe had very high affinity for, and full efficacy at, 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors. In the 5-HT2A receptor functional assay, 25D-NBOMe, 25E-NBOMe, 25I-NBOH and 25N-NBOMe had subnanomolar to low nanomolar potencies similar to (+)lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) while 25H-NBOMe had lower potency, similar to serotonin. At the 5-HT2C receptor, four had very high potencies, similar to LSD and serotonin, while 2511-NBOMe had lower potency. At the 5-HT2B receptor, the compounds had lower affinity, potency and efficacy compared to 5-HT2A or 5-HT2C. The phenethylamines had low to mid micromolar affinities and potencies at the transporters. These results demonstrate that these -NBOMe and -NBOH substituted phenethylamines have a biochemical pharmacology consistent with hallucinogenic activity, with little psychostimulant activity.

In an effort to shed some light on this topic, we have used a xenograft model of rat insulinoma (RIN) in mice, mimicking an intramuscular islet transplantation situation. METHODS: A total of 10(5) RIN cells were subcutaneously implanted in nude mice (N.=8). Tumor size and glycaemia levels were determined daily. Rat C-peptide was measured to demonstrate rat insulin production. PET imaging with C-11-(+)-alpha-dihydrotetrabenazine (C-11-DTBZ) was done at 3 and 4 weeks and compared with F-18-FDG and F-18-DOPA studies in the same mice. Ex-vivo autoradiography with C-11-DTBZ was carried out in frozen sections of tumors. VMAT2 expression was measured by Western-blot and immunohistochemistry in tumors and RIN cells. RESULTS: Functional rat insulin production in mice was demonstrated by substantial decrease in glycaemia (<50 mg/dL by week 4) and rat C-peptide levels (7.2 +/- 2.6 ng/mL) similar to those measured in control rats. PET studies showed that tumor imaging with C-11-DTBZ at four (N.=8) and five (N.=5) weeks was negative; only bigger tumors could be seen with F-18-DOPA. In explanted tumors C-11-DTBZ autoradiography was negative, albeit VMAT2 expression measured by Western-blot and immunohistochemistry was lower than in cultured RIN cells. CONCLUSIONS: Although insulinomas are fully functional it does not seem feasible to use C-11-DTBZ for in-vivo measuring of BCM. This might either be due to inherent technical limitations of PET, decrease in VMAT2 expression in the tumors due to unknown reasons, or other biological limiting facts.

Diamides are particularly active on Lepidoptera pests, including tomato leafminer, Tuta absoluta (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae). High levels of diamide resistance were recently described in some European populations of T absoluta, however, the mechanisms of resistance remained unknown. In this study the molecular basis of diamide resistance was investigated in a diamide resistant strain from Italy (IT-GELA-SD4), and additional resistant field populations collected in Greece, Spain and Brazil. The genetics of resistance was investigated by reciprocally crossing strain IT-GELA-SD4 with a susceptible strain and revealed an autosomal incompletely recessive mode of inheritance. To investigate the possible role of target-site mutations as known from diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella), we sequenced respective domains of the RyR gene of T absoluta. Genotyping of individuals of IT-GELA-SD4 and field-collected strains showing different levels of diamide resistance revealed the presence of G4903E and I4746M RyR target-site mutations. These amino acid substitutions correspond to those recently described for diamide resistant diamondback moth, i.e. G4946E and I4790M. We also detected two novel mutations, G4903V and I4746T, in some of the resistant T. absoluta strains. Radioligand binding studies with thoracic membrane preparations of the IT-GELA-SD4 strain provided functional evidence that these mutations alter the affinity of the RyR to diamides. In combination with previous work on P. xylostella our study highlights the importance of position G4903 (G4946 in P. xylostella) of the insect RyR in defining sensitivity to diamides. The discovery of diamide resistance mutations in T absoluta populations of diverse geographic origin has serious implications for the efficacy of diamides under applied conditions. The implementation of appropriate resistance management strategies is strongly advised to delay the further spread of resistance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: The protein expression levels were examined by Western blot analysis. Biological activity of Sm-153-DTPA-c(CGRRAGGSC) was assessed with the radioligand binding assay and competitive inhibition experiment. Subcellular localization of the cyclic peptide was observed by fluorescence microscopy. Animals were implanted with MHCC97-H cells and administered with Sm-153-DTPA-c(CGRRAGGSC). Hematoxylin and eosin staining, electron microscopy, and immunohistochemistry were performed to evaluate the effects of Sm-153-DTPAc( CGRRAGGSC) on implanted tumors. Result: The expression levels of interleukin 11 receptor were significantly elevated, by 2-to 5-fold, in tumor cell lines, especially for MHCC97-H cells. Characterization of Sm-153-DTPA-c(CGRRAGGSC) showed that the biological activity of the cyclic peptide was not altered after labeling, and the radiolabeled cyclic peptide exhibited sufficient binding affinity to interleukin 11 receptor. The cyclic peptide of c(CGRRAGGSC) was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm and on the cell membrane of MHCC97-H cells. The in vivo experiments showed that the tumor growth was significantly inhibited by the treatment of Sm-153-DTPA-c(CGRRAGGSC). The inhibitory effect of Sm-153-DTPA-c(CGRRAGGSC) on tumor growth was further confirmed by Hematoxylin and eosin staining, electron microscopy, and immunohistochemistry. Moreover, the expression levels of interleukin 11 receptor in implanted tumors were significantly decreased in the treatment groups. Conclusion: Sm-153-DTPA-c (CGRRAGGSC) could specifically bind to interleukin 11 receptor on MHCC97-H liver tumor cells, inhibiting the cell proliferation and inducing cellular apoptosis. These findings provide experimental evidence for the development of individual treatment of liver cancers, as well as recurrence and metastasis.

Methods: We evaluated the expression and function of CXCR4 and CD26 in colon cancer cell lines and xenografts following treatment with common chemotherapies using radioligand binding, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and enzymatic assays. Results: 5-Fluorouracil, oxaliplatin and SN-38 (the active metabolite of irinotecan), as well as cisplatin, methotrexate and vinblastine, each caused decreases in cell surface CXCR4 and concomitant increases in CD26 on HI 29, 184, HRT-18, 5W480 and 5W620 CRC cell lines. Flow cytometry indicated that the decline in CXCR4 was associated with a significant loss of CXCR4+/CD26- cells. Elevations in CD26 were paralleled by increases in both the intrinsic dipeptidyl peptidase activity of CD26 as well as its capacity to bind extracellular adenosine deaminase. Orthotopic HI 29 xenografts treated with standard CRC chemotherapeutics 5-tluorouracil, irinotecan, or oxaliplatin showed dramatic increases in CD26 compared to untreated tumors. Consistent with the loss of CXCR4 and gain in CD26, migratory responses to exogenous CXCL12 were eliminated in cells pretreated with cytotoxic agents, although cells retained basal motility. Analysis of cancer initiating cell CD44 and CD133 subsets revealed drug dependent responses of CD26/CD44/CD133 populations, suggesting that the benefits of combining standard chemotherapies 5-fluoruracil and oxaliplatin may be derived from their complementary elimination of cell populations. Conclusion: Our results indicate that conventional anticancer agents may act to inhibit chemokine-mediated migration through eradication of CXCR4+ cells and attenuation of chemokine gradients through elevation of CD26 activity.

Test-retest reproducibility of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 ligand [<SUP>18</SUP>F]FPEB with bolus plus constant infusion in humans	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						[F-18\]FPEB; Human; Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5; Positron emission tomography; Reproducibility	IN-VITRO; MGLUR5; PET; BINDING; QUANTITATION; RADIOTRACER; F-18-FPEB; TARGETS; TRACER	Purpose [F-18]FPEB is a promising PET radioligand for the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), a potential target for the treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the test-retest reproducibility of [F-18]FPEB in the human brain. Methods Seven healthy male subjects were scanned twice, 3 - 11 weeks apart. Dynamic data were acquired using bolus plus infusion of 162 +/- 32 MBq [F-18]FPEB. Four methods were used to estimate volume of distribution (V-T): equilibrium analysis (EQ) using arterial (EQ(A)) or venous input data (EQ(V)), MA1, and a two-tissue compartment model (2 T). Binding potential (BPND) was also estimated using cerebellar white matter (CWM) or gray matter (CGM) as the reference region using EQ, 2 T and MA1. Absolute test-retest variability (aTRV) of V-T and BPND were calculated for each method. Venous blood measurements (C-V) were compared with arterial input (C-A) to examine their usability in EQ analysis. Results Regional V-T estimated by the four methods displayed a high degree of agreement (r(2) ranging from 0.83 to 0.99 among the methods), although EQ(A) and EQ(V) overestimated V-T by a mean of 9 % and 7 %, respectively, compared to 2 T. Mean values of aTRV of V-T were 11 % by EQ(A), 12 % by EQ(V), 14 % by MA1 and 14 % by 2 T. Regional BP (ND) also agreed well among the methods and mean aTRV of BP (ND) was 8 - 12 % (CWM) and 7 - 9 % (CGM). Venous and arterial blood concentrations of [F-18]FPEB were well matched during equilibrium (C-V = 1.01 center dot C-A, r(2) = 0.95). Conclusions [F-18]FPEB binding shows good TRV with minor differences among analysis methods. Venous blood can be used as an alternative for input function measurement instead of arterial blood in EQ analysis. Thus, [F-18]FPEB is an excellent PET imaging tracer for mGluR5 in humans.

Characterization of [<SUP>125</SUP>I]GLP-1 (9-36), a novel radiolabeled analog of the major metabolite of glucagon-like peptide 1 to a receptor distinct from GLP1-R and function of the peptide in murine aorta	LIFE SCIENCES			English	Article						Cyclic AMP; Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1); Scintillation proximity assay; Radioligand binding; Vasoconstriction	RAT CONDUIT ARTERIES; GLP-1; AMIDE; LIGANDS; VIVO	Aims: Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is an insulin secretagogue, released in response to meal ingestion and efficiently lowers blood glucose in Type 2 diabetic patients. GLP-1(7-36) is rapidly metabolized by dipeptidyl peptidase IV to the major metabolite GLP-1(9-36)-amide, often thought to be inactive. Inhibitors of this enzyme are widely used to treat diabetes. Our aim was to characterize the binding of GLP-1(9-36) to native mouse tissues and to cells expressing GLP1-R as well as to measure functional responses in the mouse aorta compared with GLP-1 (7-36). Main methods: The affinity of 11251]GLP-1(7-36) and [[I-125]GLP-1 (9-36) was measured in mouse tissues by saturation binding and autoradiography used to determine receptor distribution. The affinity of both peptides was compared in binding to recombinant GLP-1 receptors using cAMP and scintillation proximity assays. Vasoactivity was determined in mouse aortae in vitro. Key findings: In cells expressing GLP-1 receptors, GLP-1(7-36) bound with the expected high affinities (0.1 nM) and an EC50 of 0.07 nM in cAMP assays but GLP-1(9-36) bound with 70,000 and 100,000 fold lower affinities respectively. In contrast, in mouse brain, both labeled peptides bound with a single high affinity, with Hill slopes close to unity, although receptor density was an order of magnitude lower for [1251]GLP-1(9-36). In functional experiments both peptides had similar potencies, GLP-1(7-36), pD2 = 7.40 024 and GLP-1(9-36), pD(2) = 7.57 0.64. Significance: These results suggest that GLP-1(9-36) binds and has functional activity in the vasculature but these actions may be via a pathway that is distinct from the classical GLP-1 receptor and insulin secretagogue actions.

Sex differences in ET-1 receptor expression and Ca2+ signaling in the IMCD. Am J Physiol Renal Physiol 305: F1099-F1104, 2013. First published August 14, 2013; doi:10.1152/ajprenal.00400.2013.-The inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) is the nephron segment with the highest production of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and the greatest expression of ET-1 receptors that function to adjust Na+ and water balance. We have reported that male rats have reduced natriuresis in response to direct intramedullary infusion of ET-1 compared with female rats. Our aim was to determine whether alterations of ET-1 receptor expression and downstream intracellular Ca2+ signaling within the IMCD could account for these sex differences. IMCDs from male and female rats were isolated for radioligand binding or microdissected for intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+](i)) measurement by fluorescence imaging of fura-2 AM. IMCD from male and female rats had similar ETB expression (655 +/- 201 vs. 567 +/- 39 fmol/mg protein, respectively), whereas male rats had significantly higher ETA expression (436 +/- 162 vs. 47 +/- 29 fmol/mg protein, respectively; P < 0.05). The [Ca2+](i) response to ET-1 was significantly greater in IMCDs from male compared with female rats (288 +/- 52 vs. 118 +/- 32 AUC, nM x 3 min, respectively; P < 0.05). In IMCDs from male rats, the [Ca2+](i) response to ET-1 was significantly blunted by the ETA antagonist BQ-123 but not by the ETB antagonist BQ-788 (control: 137 +/- 27; BQ-123: 53 +/- 11; BQ-788: 84 +/- 25 AUC, nM x 3 min; P < 0.05), consistent with greater ETA receptor function in male rats. These data demonstrate a sex difference in ETA receptor expression that results in differences in ET-1 Ca2+ signaling in IMCD. Since activation of ETA receptors is thought to oppose ETB receptor activation, enhanced ETA function in male rats could limit the natriuretic effects of ETB receptor activation.

We investigated the neuroprotective contribution of estrogen receptors (ER alpha and ER beta) against MPTP toxicity by examining the membrane dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT), the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in ER knock out (ERKO) C57Bl/6 male mice compared to their plasma steroid levels. A dose response to MPTP comparing wild-type (WT) to ERKO mice was studied. WT mice were also compared to ERKO mice pretreated with 17 beta-estradiol alone and with MPTP. Specific radioligand binding autoradiography and in situ hybridization for DAT, VMAT2 and TH were assayed in the striatum and the substantia nigra (SN). Intact ERKO beta mice had both striatal transporters levels lower than WT and ERKO alpha mice. MPTP caused a dose-dependant loss of both striatal transporters that correlated with striatal DA concentrations. Compared to WT and ERKO beta mice, ERKO alpha mice DAT, VMAT2 and TH were affected at lower MPTP doses. In the striatum and SN, ERKO alpha mice were more vulnerable and 17 beta-estradiol protected against MPTP toxicity only in WT mice. ERKO alpha mice blood plasma had higher levels of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone and 3 beta-diol compared to the plasma of WT and ERKO beta mice. 17 beta-estradiol treatment increased estradiol plasma levels in all genotypes. Striatal DA concentrations and SN TH mRNA correlated inversely with plasma testosterone and 3 beta-diol levels. Hence, in male mice the lack of ER alpha or ER beta altered their basal plasma steroid levels and both striatal DA transporters as well as their susceptibility to MPTP toxicity.

Jeffrey			A novel class of positive allosteric modulators of metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 1 interact with a site distinct from that of negative allosteric modulators	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							BINDING-SITE; IN-VIVO; NONCOMPETITIVE ANTAGONIST; ANTIPSYCHOTIC-LIKE; HIGH-AFFINITY; ACTIVATION; MPEP; N-(1,3-DIPHENYL-1H-PYRAZOL-5-YL)BENZAMIDES; 2-METHYL-6-(PHENYLETHYNYL)PYRIDINE; GLUTAMATE-RECEPTOR-SUBTYPE-5	We recently reported a novel class of compounds, represented by 3-cyano-N-(1,3-diphenyl-1H-pyrazol-5-yl) benzamide (CDPPB), that act as positive allosteric modulators (potentiators) of metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) subtype 5. Studies of CDPPB analogs revealed that some compounds in this series serve also as positive allosteric modulators of mGluR1. Although CDPPB is selective for mGluR5 relative to other mGluR subtypes, several CDPPB analogs also showed 2.5-fold potentiation of glutamate-induced calcium transients in cells expressing mGluR1 at 10 mu M, with 4-nitro-N-(1,4-diphenyl-1Hpyrazol5- yl) benzamide (VU-71) being selective for mGluR1. In previous studies, we found that two structural classes of mGluR5-selective allosteric potentiators, including CDPPB, share a common binding site with the allosteric mGluR5 antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl) pyridine. Negative allosteric modulators of mGluR1, regardless of structural class, have been reported to bind to a common allosteric antagonist site on this receptor. However, neither the novel CDPPB analogs nor previously identified allosteric mGluR1 potentiators [e. g., (S)-2( 4-fluorophenyl)-1-(toluene-4-sulfonyl) pyrrolidine (Ro 67-7476), ethyl diphenylacetylcarbamate (Ro 01-6128), and butyl (9Hxanthene9- carbonyl) carbamate (Ro 67-4853)] displaced the binding of [3H] 1-(3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrano[2,3-b] quinolin-7-yl)2- phenyl-1-ethanone (R214127), a high-affinity radioligand for the allosteric antagonist site on mGluR1 at concentrations several orders of magnitude higher than those required to induce allosteric potentiation of mGluR1 responses. These data suggest that allosteric potentiators of mGluR1 act at a site that is distinct from that of allosteric antagonists of mGluR1. Sitedirected mutagenesis revealed that valine at position 757 in transmembrane V of mGluR1a is crucial for the activity of multiple classes of allosteric mGluR1 potentiators.

The cardiostimulant effects of CGP12177, mediated through a beta(1)-adrenoceptor site with low affinity for (-)-propranolol, are potentiated by the nonselective PDE inhibitor IBMX but the role of PDE isoenzymes is unknown. We studied the effects of the PDE3-selective inhibitor cilostamide (300 nM) and PDE4-selective inhibitor rolipram (1 mu M) on the positive inotropic and cyclic AMP-enhancing effects of CGP12177 and noradrenaline in right ventricular strips of rat. 2 CGP12177 (under (-)-propranolol 200 nM) only increased contractile force in the presence of either cilostamide or rolipram with -logEC(50)M 6.7 (E-max 23% over basal) and 7.1 (E-max 50%) respectively. The combination of cilostamide and rolipram caused CGP12177 to enhance contractile force with -logEC(50)M 7.7 and E-max 178%. 3 The positive inotropic effects of noradrenaline (-logEC(50)M 6.9) were potentiated by rolipram (-logEC(50)M 7.4) but not by cilostamide (-logEC(50)M 7.0). 4 In the presence of rolipram and (-)-propranolol, noradrenaline (2 mu M) and CGP12177 ( 10 mM) produced matching inotropic effects but failed to increase cyclic AMP levels. 20 mu M (-)-noradrenaline increased cyclic AMP levels, a response further enhanced by rolipram. 5 Both PDE3 and PDE4 of rat ventricle appear to hydrolyse cyclic AMP generated through the low-affinity beta(1)-adrenoceptor site, thereby preventing inotropic responses of CGP12177. When (-)- noradrenaline interacts with the beta(1)-adrenoceptor, the generated cyclic AMP is hydrolysed only by PDE4, thereby reducing cardiostimulation. 5 Both PDE3 and PDE4 of rat ventricle appear to hydrolyse cyclic AMP generated through the low-affinity beta(1)-adrenoceptor site, thereby preventing inotropic responses of CGP12177.

Furthermore, after 1 h of exposure to PEMFs the receptor density was statistically increased (P<0.01) (B-max =126 +/- 10 and 215 +/- 15 fmol mg(-1) protein, respectively). 3 The effect of PEMFs was specific to the A(2A) adenosine receptors. This effect was also intensity, time and temperature dependent. 4 In the adenylyl cyclase assays the A(2A) receptor agonists, HE-NECA and NECA, increased cyclic AMP accumulation in untreated human neutrophils with an EC50 value of 43 (40-47) and 255 (228-284) nM. respectively. The capability of HE-NECA and NECA to stimulate cyclic AMP levels in human neutrophils was increased (P<0.01) after exposure to PEMFs with an EC50 value of 10(8-13) and 61(52-71) nM, respectively. 5 In the superoxide anion (O-2(-)) production assays HE-NECA and NECA inhibited the generation of O-2(-) in untreated human neutrophils, with an EC50 value of 3.6(3.1-4.2) and of 23(20-27) nM, respectively. Moreover, in PEMF-treated human neutrophils, the same compounds show an EC50 value of 1.6(1.2-2.1) and of 6.0(4.7-7.5) nM respectively. 6 These results indicate the presence of significant alterations in the expression and in the functionality of adenosine A(2A) receptors in human neutrophils treated with PEMFs.

GABAergic and glutumatergic systems in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Methods: In situ radioligand binding and autoradiography were used to measure neurochemical markers in Brodmann's Area (BA) 9 from control subjects and subjects with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia (n = 8 per group). Results: Compared to tissue from schizophrenic (mean +/-S.E.M. 385 +/- 44 fmol/mg ETE) and control (383 +/- 44 fmol/mg ETE) subjects, there was an increase in the density of [H-3]flumazenil binding to the benzodiazepine binding site on the GABA, receptor in subjects with bipolar disorder (451 +/- 17 fmol/mg ETE; P < 0.05). There was no difference in the density of [H-3]muscimol binding to the GABA(A) receptor or in the density of the serotonin(1A) receptor, serotonin(2A) receptor, ionotropic glutamate receptors or the serotonin transporter between the three cohorts. There was an age-related decrease in NMDA receptor density in control subjects that was absent in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. An age-related increase in [H-3]flumazenil binding in schizophrenia was absent in control and bipolar disorder subjects. Limitations: This Study involved a relatively small number of individuals. Conclusions: An increase in the gamma2-receptor sub-unit in the GABA(A) receptor has been shown to increase benzodiazepine but not [H-3]muscimol binding, this is the mismatch in binding we have shown in BA 9 from subjects with bipolar disorder. Thus, a change in the assembly of receptor subunits into GABA(A), receptors may be involved in the neuropathology of bipolar disorder. There may also be differences in age-related changes in cortical receptor density between bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

This study examines the M-2:M-3 ratio and the role of M-2-receptors in contraction of pig urinary bladder. 2 Competition experiments with [H-3]-QNB determined the ratio of M-2:M-3 In functional studies, affinity values (pK(B)) for 4-DAMP, darifenacin and methoctramine were calculated. Similar experiments were performed on tissues following selective M-3-inactivation (incubation with 40 nM 4-DAMP mustard in the presence of 1 muM methoctramine to protect M-2-receptors). precontraction with 50 mM KCl and relaxation with isoprenaline (30 muM) or forskolin (1 muM). 3 In competition binding, displacement of [H-3]-QNB by 4-DAMP, darifenacin and methoctramine best fitted a two-site model suggesting a predominant (70-80%) population of M-2-receptors. 4 On normal detrusor in vitro, 4-DAMP and methoctramine caused surmountable antagonism of responses to carbachol with pK(B) values of 9.37+/-0.07 and 6.05+/-0.05 respectively. Darifenacin caused unsurmountable antagonism, the apparent pK(B) value being 8.61+/-0.10. 5 In tissues where the M-3-receptors had been inactivated and cyclic AMP levels elevated, 4-DAMP and darifenacin were less potent, with apparent pK(B) values of 8.72+/-0.08 and 6.74+/-0.07. In contrast, methoctramine was more potent, the apparent pK(B) value increasing significantly to 6.86 +/- 0.06. 6 These data suggest that the pig bladder possesses a similar muscarinic receptor population to the human bladder and that the M-3-receptor subtype mediates contraction of the normal detrusor muscle. However an involvement of M-2-receptors in contraction can be observed following pharmacological manipulation of the receptor population.

Of these only noradrenaline (mean pEC(50) = 6.49) and A-54741 (6.90) evoked changes in Ca-i(2+), A-54741 was a partial agonist relative to noradrenaline, achieving only 33% of the noradrenaline maximum. 3 Ca-i(2+) changes induced by noradrenaline and A-54741 were antagonized by the alpha(2)-selective antagonist rauwolscine (10 nM) and by the alpha(1)-selective antagonists prazosin (0.1 nM) and doxazosin 4 Phenylephrine (100 mu M) and UK-14304 (10 mu M) alone were ineffective in causing Ca-i(2+) increase. In the presence of a fixed concentration of UK-14304 (3.0 mu M), phenylephrine induced concentration-dependent increases in Ca-i(2+) (mean pEC(50) = 5.33). In the presence of phenylephrine (30.0 mu M) UK-14304 induced Ca-i(2+) release (pEC(50) = 6.92). The effects of phenylephrine were abolished by prazosin (1.0 nM) or rauwolscine (100 nM). 5 In saturation radioligand binding experiments using membranes of parental (non-transfected) CHL cells there was a small, specific binding of [H-3]-prazosin (B-max = 24 fmol mg protein(-1); pK(D) = 10.24). 6 Collectively, these data suggest that oc-adrenoceptor agonist-induced Ca-i(2+) release in CHL fibroblasts transfected with the human alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor is dependent upon co-activation of the recombinant receptor and a native alpha(1)-adrenoceptor.

Procaterol was labelled by reductive alkylation of the desisopropyl precursor with [C-11]acetone under the influence of NaCNBH3 and acetic acid. Synthesis and HPLC purification were performed in 34 min. Specific activities ranged from 26.5-39.3 TBq (about 700-1000 Ci)/mmol and the radiochemical yield was 2.4-8.6% (corrected for decay). Biodistribution studies were performed in male Wistar rats which were either untreated or predosed with (D,L)-propranolol hydrochloride (beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, 2.5 mg/kg), ICI 118551 (beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, 0.15 mg/ kg), CGP 20712A (beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, 0.15; mg/kg) or isoprenaline (B-adrenoceptor agonist, 15 mg/kg). Specific binding was observed in lungs, spleen and red blood cells, tissues known to contain beta(2)-adrenoceptors. Pulmonary binding was blocked by propranolol, ICI 118551 and isoprenaline, but not by CGP 20712A. This binding pattern is consistent with the beta(2) selectivity of the adioligand. The clearance of [C-11]procaterol was biphasic, with a rapid distribution phase (t(1/2) 0.17 min) representing 90% of the injected dose followed by an elimination phase (t(1/2) 18.1 min). About 45% of the plasma radioactivity was unmetabolized procaterol at 15 min postinjection. In a dynamic PET-study, the lungs of untreated control rats could barely be detected and total/non-specific binding ratios rose to only 1.2 at 20 min postinjection. Although labelling and administration of (-) erythro-procaterol the most active of 4 stereoisomers, may produce better results, [C-11]procaterol seems unsuitable for beta-adrenoceptor imaging.

Methods Patients who underwent resection for de-novo glioblastoma (GBM) and had a re-resection in case of a recurrent tumor following radiochemotherapy and subsequent chemotherapy were included (n = 16). Histological and immunohistochemical stainings were performed at initial diagnosis and at recurrence (n = 96 tissue specimens). Levels of PSMA expression both in endothelial and non-endothelial cells as well as vascular density (CD34) were quantified via immunohistochemistry and changes between initial diagnosis and recurrence were determined. Immunohistochemical findings were correlated with survival and established clinical parameters. Results PSMA expression was found to be present in all GBM tissue samples at initial diagnosis as well as in all but one case of recurrent tumor samples. The level of PSMA expression in glioblastoma varied inter-individually both in endothelial and non-endothelial cells. Likewise, the temporal evolution of PSMA expression highly varied in between patients. The level of vascular PSMA expression at recurrence and its change between initial diagnosis and recurrence was associated with post recurrence survival time: Patients with high vascular PSMA expression at recurrence as well as patients with increasing PSMA expression throughout the disease course survived shorter than patients with low vascular PSMA expression or decreasing vascular PSMA expression. There was no significant correlation of PSMA expression with MGMT promoter methylation status or Ki-67 labelling index. Conclusion PSMA is expressed in glioblastoma both at initial diagnosis and at recurrence. High vascular PSMA expression at recurrence seems to be a negative prognostic marker. Thus, PSMA expression in GBM might present a promising target for theranostic approaches in recurrent glioblastoma. Especially PSMA PET imaging and PSMA-directed radioligand therapy warrant further studies in brain tumor patients.

Association of Early β-Amyloid Accumulation and Neuroinflammation Measured With [<SUP>11</SUP>C] PBR28 in Elderly Individuals Without Dementia	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN TSPO; VIVO RADIOLIGAND BINDING; VASCULAR RISK-FACTORS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; INSULIN-RESISTANCE; MICROGLIAL ACTIVATION; HUMAN BRAIN; BIOMARKER; MIDLIFE; POLYMORPHISM	Objective To examine whether early beta-amyloid (A beta) accumulation and metabolic risk factors are associated with neuroinflammation in elderly individuals without dementia. Methods We examined 54 volunteers (mean age 70.0 years, 56% women, 51% APOE epsilon 4 carriers) with the translocator protein (TSPO) tracer [C-11]PBR28 to assess neuroinflammation and with [C-11] Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) to assess cerebral A beta accumulation. [C-11]PBR28 and [C-11]PiB standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were quantified in 6 regions of interests by using the cerebellar cortex as a pseudo-reference and reference region, respectively. Fasting venous glucose, insulin, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) values were determined. Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated. A subset of individuals (n = 11) underwent CSF sampling, and A beta 40, A beta 42, total tau, phospho-tau, soluble TREM2, and YKL-40 levels were measured. Results Among the whole study group, no significant association was found between [C-11]PiB and [C-11] PBR28 SUVR composite scores (slope 0.02, p = 0.30). However, higher [C-11]PiB binding was associated with higher [C-11]PBR28 binding among amyloid-negative ([C-11]PiB composite score <= 1.5) (TSPO genotype-, age- and sex-adjusted slope 0.26, p = 0.008) but not among amyloid-positive (slope -0.004, p = 0.88) participants. Higher CSF soluble TREM2 (r(s) = 0.72, p = 0.01) and YKL-40 (r(s) = 0.63, p = 0.04) concentrations were associated with a higher [C-11]PBR28 composite score. Higher body mass index, HOMA-IR, and hs-CRP were associated with higher [C-11]PBR28 binding in brain regions where A beta accumulation is first detected in Alzheimer disease. Conclusions While there was no association between amyloid and neuroinflammation in the overall study group, neuroinflammation was associated with amyloid among the subgroup at early stages of amyloid pathology.

Differences were compared among combinations of three chemical peptidase inhibitors: amastatin, captopril, and phosphoramidon. The ratio of potencies of ME in mouse vas deferens pretreated with both sialorphin (100 mu M) and a mixture of the three peptidase inhibitors (1 mu M each) was higher than that with the mixture of peptidase inhibitors alone at any dose. Intrathecal administration of sialorphin (100-400 nmol) significantly and dose dependently increased ME (3 nmol)-induced antinociception with the mixture of three peptidase inhibitors (10 nmol each). The degree of antinociception with a combination of any two of the peptidase inhibitors (10 nmol each) in the absence of sialorphin was less than that in the presence of sialorphin (200 nmol). Pretreatment with both sialorphin (200 nmol) and the mixture of three peptidase inhibitors (10 nmol each) produced an approximately 100-fold augmentation in ME (10 nmol)-induced antinociception, but without signs of toxicity such as motor dysfunction in rats. Radioligand receptor binding assay revealed that sialorphin did not affect either binding affinity or maximal binding capacity of [D-Ala(2),N-MePhe(4),Gly-ol(5)]enkephalin. These results indicate that sialorphin potentiates the effects of ME without toxicity by a mechanism other than peptidase inhibition and with no effect on its affinity to mu-opioid receptors. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Sialorphin is regarded as an endogenous peptidase inhibitor that interacts with enkephalin-degrading enzymes. The results of these in vitro and in vivo studies confirm that sialorphin potentiates the effects of [Met(5)]enkephalin without toxicity by an action other than peptidase inhibition. This suggests that sialorphin offers the advantage of reducing or negating the side effects of opioid drugs and endogenous opioid peptides.

Post mortem evaluation of inflammation, oxidative stress, and PPARγ activation in a nonhuman primate model of cardiac sympathetic neurodegeneration	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PARKINSON DISEASE; ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION; MYOCARDIAL SCINTIGRAPHY; INSULIN-RESISTANCE; MIBG SCINTIGRAPHY; CD36 EXPRESSION; ADRENAL-MEDULLA; ADIPOSE-TISSUE; PIOGLITAZONE; DENERVATION	Cardiac dysautonomia is a common nonmotor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) associated with loss of sympathetic innervation to the heart and decreased plasma catechol-amines. Disease-modifying strategies for PD cardiac neurodegeneration are not available, and biomarkers of target engagement are lacking. Systemic administration of the catechol-aminergic neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) recapitulates PD cardiac dysautonomia pathology. We recently used positron emission tomography (PET) to visualize and quantify cardiac sympathetic innervation, oxidative stress, and inflammation in adult male rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta; n = 10) challenged with 6-OHDA (50mg/kg; i.v.). Twenty-four hours post-intoxication, the animals were blindly and randomly assigned to receive daily doses of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) agonist pioglitazone (n = 5; 5mg/kg p.o.) or placebo (n = 5). Quantification of PET radioligand uptake showed increased oxidative stress and inflammation one week after 6-OHDA which resolved to baseline levels by twelve weeks, at which time pioglitazone-treated animals showed regionally preserved sympathetic innervation. Here we report post mortem characterization of heart and adrenal tissue in these animals compared to age and sex matched normal controls (n = 5). In the heart, 6-OHDA-treated animals showed a significant loss of sympathetic nerve fibers density (tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive fibers). The anatomical distribution of markers of sympathetic innervation (TH) and inflammation (HLA-DR) significantly correlated with respective in vivo PET findings across left ventricle levels and regions. No changes were found in alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity. Additionally, CD36 protein expression was increased at the cardiomyocyte intercalated discs following PPAR gamma-activation compared to placebo and control groups. Systemic 6-OHDA decreased adrenal medulla expression of catecholamine producing enzymes (TH and aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase) and circulating levels of norepinephrine, which were attenuated by PPAR gamma-activation. Overall, these results validate in vivo PET findings of cardiac sympathetic innervation, oxidative stress, and inflammation and illustrate cardiomyocyte CD36 upregulation as a marker of PPAR gamma target engagement.

This study used an agonist radioligand with agonist challenge to assess dopamine release capacity and D-2/D-3 receptor availability in MDD. METHODS: Twenty-six treatment-naive adults with MDD and 26 healthy comparison participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during a probabilistic reinforcement task, and positron emission tomography with the D-3-preferring ligand [C-11]-(+)-PHNO, before and after oral dextroamphetamine. MDD participants then received pramipexole treatment for 6 weeks. RESULTS: MDD participants had trend-level greater dopamine release capacity in the ventral striatum, as measured by percent change in baseline binding potential relative to nondisplaceable compartment (Delta BPND) (-34% vs. -30%; p =.072, d = 0.58) but no difference in D-2/D-3 receptor availability (BPND). Striatal and extrastriatal BPND and percent change in baseline BPND were not significantly associated with blood oxygen level-dependent response to reward prediction error in the ventral striatum, severity of depression and anhedonia, or antidepressant response to pramipexole (response rate = 72.7%). CONCLUSIONS: [C-11]-(+)-PHNO demonstrated high sensitivity to displacement by amphetamine-induced dopamine release, but dopamine release capacity and D-2/D-3 availability were not associated with ventral striatal activation to reward prediction error or clinical features, in this study powered to detect large effects. While a preponderance of indirect evidence implicates dopaminergic dysfunction in MDD, these findings suggest that presynaptic dopamine dysregulation may not be a feature of MDD or a prerequisite for treatment response to dopamine agonists.

Probing Substituents in the 1-and 3-Position: Tetrahydropyrazino-Annelated Water-Soluble Xanthine Derivatives as Multi-Target Drugs With Potent Adenosine Receptor Antagonistic Activity	FRONTIERS IN CHEMISTRY			English	Article						caffeine derivatives; anellated xanthines; tetrahydropyrazino[2, 1-f]purinediones; adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonists; adenosine At receptor antagonists; monoamine oxidase (MAO) B inhibitors; Alzheimer's disease; Parkinson's disease	MONOAMINE-OXIDASE-B; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; A(2A) RECEPTORS; INHIBITORS; RADIOLIGAND; CAFFEINE; AFFINITY; A(1); RAT; PHARMACOLOGY	Tetrahydropyrazino-annelated theophylline (1,3-dimethylxanthine) derivatives have previously been shown to display increased water-solubility as compared to the parent xanthines due to their basic character. In the present study, we modified this promising scaffold by replacing the 1,3-dimethyl residues by a variety of alkyl groups including combinations of different substituents in both positions. Substituted benzyl or phenethyl residues were attached to the N8 of the resulting 1,3-dialkyl-tetrahydropyrazino[2,1-f]purinediones with the aim to obtain multi target drugs that block human A(1) and A(2A) adenosine receptors (ARs) and monoaminoxidase B (MAO-B). 1,3-Diethyl-substituted derivatives showed high affinity for A(1) ARs, e.g., 15d (PSB-18339, 8-m-bromobenzyl-substituted) displayed a K-i value of 13.6 nM combined with high selectivity. 1-Ethyl-3-propargyl-substituted derivatives exhibited increased A(2A) AR affinity. The 8-phenethyl derivative 20h was selective for the A(2A) AR (K, 149 nM), while the corresponding 8-benzyl-substituted compound 20e (PSB-1869) blocked A(1) and A(2A) ARs with equal potency (K, A1, 180 nM. A(2A), 282 nM). The 1-ethyl-3-methyl-substituted derivative 16a (PSB-18405) bearing a m,p-dichlorobenzyl residue at N8 blocked all three targets, A(1) ARs (K, 396 nM), A(2A) ARs (K-i, 1,620 nM), and MAO-B (IC50 106 nM) with high selectivity vs. the other subtypes (A(2B) and A(3) ARs, MAO-A), and can thus be considered as a multi-target drug. Our findings were rationalized by molecular docking studies based on previously published X-ray structures of the protein targets. The new drugs have potential for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Parkinson's disease.

Methods: [C-11]ITMM was synthesized by O-methylation of the desmethyl precursor with [C-11]methyl triflate in the presence of NaOH at room temperature. In vitro selectivity and brain distributions of[C-11]ITMM in mice were characterized. Radiation absorbed-dose by [C-11]ITMM in humans was calculated from mouse distribution data. Acute toxicity of ITMM at 4.72 mg/kg body weight (>74,000-fold clinical equivalent dose of [C-11]ITMM) was evaluated. Mutagenicity of ITMM was studied by the Ames test. Clinical PET imaging of mGluR1 with [C-11]ITMM was performed in a healthy volunteer. Results: ITMM had low activity for a 28-standard receptor binding profile. Regional brain uptake of [C-11]ITMM in mice was heterogeneous and consistent with known mGluR1 distributions. The radiation absorbed-dose by [C-11]ITMM in humans was sufficiently low for clinical use, and no acute toxicity or mutagenicity of ITMM occurred. A 90-min dynamic PET scan with [C-11]ITMM in a healthy volunteer showed a gradual increase of radioactivity in the cerebellum. Total distribution volume of [C-11]ITMM was highest in the cerebellum, followed by thalamus, cerebral cortex, and striatum; regional differences in brain radioactivity corresponded to the mGluR1 distribution in the brain. Peripherally, [C-11]ITMM was stable in humans: 60% of the plasma radioactivity remained in the unchanged form for 60 min. Conclusions: [C-11]ITMM is a suitable radioligand for imaging mGluR1 in the human brain providing acceptable dosimetry and pharmacological safety at the dose required for PET. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Optimization of PET-MR registrations for nonhuman primates using mutual information measures: A Multi-Transform Method (MTM)	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Registration; Transformation; Normalized mutual information; Intermodality; Nonhuman primate	IMAGE REGISTRATION; SIMILARITY MEASURES; HEALTHY-SUBJECTS; BRAIN IMAGES; RADIOLIGAND; SENSITIVITY; RECEPTORS; ALGORITHM; BINDING; HRRT	An important step in PET brain kinetic analysis is the registration of functional data to an anatomical MR image. Typically, PET-MR registrations in nonhuman primate neuroreceptor studies used PET images acquired early post-injection, (e.g., 0-10 min) to closely resemble the subject's MR image. However, a substantial fraction of these registrations (similar to 25%) fail due to the differences in kinetics and distribution for various radiotracer studies and conditions (e.g., blocking studies). The Multi-Transform Method (MTM) was developed to improve the success of registrations between PET and MR images. Two algorithms were evaluated, MTM-I and MTM-II. The approach involves creating multiple transformations by registering PET images of different time intervals, from a dynamic study, to a single reference (i.e., MR image) (MTM-I) or to multiple reference images (i.e.. MR and PET images pre-registered to the MR) (MTM-II). Normalized mutual information was used to compute similarity between the transformed PET images and the reference image(s) to choose the optimal transformation. This final transformation is used to map the dynamic dataset into the animal's anatomical MR space, required for kinetic analysis. The chosen transforms from MTM-I and MTM-II were evaluated using visual rating scores to assess the quality of spatial alignment between the resliced PET and reference images. One hundred twenty PET datasets involving eleven different tracers from 3 different scanners were used to evaluate the MTM algorithms. Studies were performed with baboons and rhesus monkeys on the HR+, HRRT, and Focus-220. Successful transformations increased from 77.5%, 85.8%, to 96.7% using the 0-10 min method, MTM-I, and MTM-II, respectively, based on visual rating scores. The Multi-Transform Methods proved to be a robust technique for PET-MR registrations for a wide range of PET studies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In MCT-treated rats, KMUP-1 f (5 mg/kg p.o.; 1 mg/kg i.p. x 21 days) decreased proliferation (PCNA-positive) cells and 5-HTT-expression in lung and 5-HT levels in plasma. In isolated PA, KMUP-1 and simvastatin (0.1-100 mu M) inhibited 5-HT (10 mu M)-induced PA constriction. L-NAME-pretreatment reduced KMUP-1-induced relaxation. In pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs), KMUP-1 (1-100 mu M) and simvastatin (10 mu M) inhibited 5-HT-induced cell migration and proliferation and KMUP-1 (1-100 mu M) inhibited 5-HT-induced Ca2+ influx. Similar to Y27632, KMUP-1 (1-100 mu M) inhibited 5-HT-induced RhoA/ROCK expression, while KMUP-1, Y27632 and simvastatin at 10 mu M inhibited 5-HT-induced 5-HTT expression and KMUP-1 inhibited 5-HT-induced phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2 in PASMCs. In human pulmonary arterial endothelial cell (HPAEC), KMUP-1 (1-100 mu M) increased the expression of eNOS and 5-HT2B and also at 10 mu M augmented eNOS expression and production of nitric oxide (NO) in 5-HT-treated HPAEC. In radioligand binding, the IC50/K-i values of KMUP-1 for 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors were 0.34/0.0971, 0.04/0.0254, and 0.408/0.214 mu M respectively. In conclusion, KMUP-1 inhibits MCT-induced PA proliferation by binding to 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors, increasing endothelial eNOS/5-HT2B receptor expression and NO release and inhibiting 5-HTT/RhoA/ROCK expression and AKT/ERK phosphorylation. KMUP-1 is suggested to be useful in the treatment of 5-HT-induced pulmonary artery proliferation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The purpose of the present study was to identify the alpha(1A)-AR and clarify its pharmacological profile using a radioligand binding assay. Experimental approach: Binding experiments with [H-3]-silodosin and [H-3]-prazosin were performed in intact tissue segments and crude membrane preparations of rat cerebral cortex. Intact tissue binding assays were also conducted in rat tail artery. Key results: [H-3]-silodosin at subnanomolar concentrations specifically bound to intact tissue segments and membrane preparations of rat cerebral cortex at the same density ( approximately 150 fmol mg(-1) total tissue protein). The binding sites in intact segments consisted of alpha(1A) and alpha(1L)-ARs that had different affinities for prazosin, while the binding sites in membranes showed an alpha(1A)-AR-like profile having single high affinity for prazosin. [H-3]-prazosin also bound at subnanomolar concentrations to alpha(1A) and alpha(1B)-ARs but not alpha(1L)-ARs in cerebral cortex; the binding densities being approximately 200 and 290 fmol mg(-1) protein in the segments and the membranes, respectively. In the segments of tail artery, [H-3]-silodosin only recognized alpha(1A)-ARs, whereas [H-3]-prazosin bound to alpha(1A) and alpha(1B)-ARs. Conclusions and implications: The present study clearly reveals the presence of alpha(1L)-ARs as a pharmacologically distinct entity from alpha(1A) and alpha(1B)-ARs in intact tissue segments of rat cerebral cortex but not tail artery. However, the alpha(1L)-ARs disappeared after tissue homogenization, suggesting their decomposition and/or their pharmacological profile changes to that of alpha(1A)-ARs.

Depending on the reaction conditions the cis isomers of 3-benzyloxy-16-hydroxymethylestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-ol (1a and 2a) were transformed into 3-benzyloxy-16-bromomethylestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl acetate (5b and 6b) or 16-bromomethyl-3-hydroxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl acetate (5c and 6c) on treatment with HBr and acetic acid. The mechanism of the process can be interpreted as involving front-side neighboring group participation. Under similar experimental conditions, the trans isomers (3a and 4a) yielded only 3-benzyloxy-16-acetoxymethylestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl acetates (3b and 4b) or 16-acetoxymethylestra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17-diyl diacetates (3d and 4d). Both the cis (1a and 2a) and the trans (3a, and 4a) isomers were transformed into 16-bromomethylestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-ol (5a-8a) by the Appel reaction on treatment with CBr4/Ph3P. Debenzylation of 5a-8a was carried out with HBr and acetic acid to yield 5e-8e. The debenzylation process in the presence of acetic anhydride produces the diacetates 5d-8d. The structures of the compounds were determined by means of MS, H-1 NMR and C-13 NMR spectroscopic methods. Compounds 5c-8c and 5e-8e were tested in a radioligand-binding assay. Except for the affinity of 7e for the estrogen receptor (K-1 = 2.55 nM), thew affinities of the eight compounds (5c-8c and 5e-8e) for the estrogen, androgen and progesterone receptors are low (K-i > 0.55, 0.52 and 0.21 mu M, respectively).

Arginine vasopressin (AVP) increased insulin release from isolated mouse islet cells in a concentration-dependent manner, with a submaximal response at 100 nM. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis detected V1b and oxytocin, but not V1a or V2, receptor transcripts in mouse islet cells. We characterized the recently synthesized vasopressin receptor subtype antagonists (2S)1-[(2R 3S)-(5-chloro-3-(2-chlorophenyl)-1-(3,4-dimethoxybenzene-sulfonyl)-3-hydroxy-2,3-difydro-1H-indole-2-carbonyl)-pyrrolidine-2-carboxamide] (SR49059), 1-{1-[4-(3-acetylaminopropoxy) benzoyl]-4-piperidyl}-3,4-dihydro-2(1H)-quinolinone (OPC-21268), and (2S,4R)-1-[5-chloro-1-[(2,4-dimethoxyphenyl) sulfonyl]-3-(2-methoxy-phenyl)-2-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indol-3-yl]-4-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyl-2-pyrrolidine carboxamide (SSR149415) using human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably expressing the three cloned mouse vasopressin receptors (V1a, V1b, and V2). A radioligand binding study showed that SR49059 and OPC-21268 potently inhibited [H-3] AVP binding to the cloned mouse V1a receptor, with K-i values of 27 and 510 nM, respectively, whereas SSR149415 potently inhibited [H-3] AVP binding to the cloned mouse V1b receptor with a K-i value of 110 nM. The inhibitory effects of vasopressin antagonists on AVP-induced insulin release correlate well with the rank order of potency to inhibit [H-3] AVP binding to the V1b receptor; pancreatic islet cells were significantly inhibited by SSR149415 but not by SR49059 or OPC-21268. Furthermore, the AVP effect on insulin release was entirely lost in mice lacking the V1b receptor but was preserved in mice lacking the V1a receptor. Our study, which combined pharmacological and knockout approaches, clearly demonstrates that vasopressin-stimulated insulin release from islet cells is mediated via V1b receptors.

Previous studies demonstrated abnormalities of the presynaptic uptake-1 assessed by I-123-MIBG-single-photon emission computed tomography. Methods and Results-This study investigated neuronal reuptake of norepinephrine (uptake-1) and beta-adrenergic receptor density in 8 patients with ARVC and 39 age-matched control subjects. All subjects underwent positron emission tomography with the volume of distribution (V-d) of [C-11]hydroxyephedrine (C-11-HED) used to assess presynaptic norepinephrine reuptake, the maximum binding capacity (B-max) of [C-11]CGP-12177 (C-11-CGP-12177) to assess postsynaptic beta-adrenergic receptor density, and [O-15]H2O for quantification of myocardial blood now. Patients with ARVC demonstrated a highly significant global reduction in postsynaptic beta-adrenergic receptor density compared with that in control subjects (B-max of C-11-CGP-12177: 5.9+/-1.3 vs 10.2+/-2.9 pmol/g tissue, P<0.0007), whereas the presynaptic uptake-1 tended toward reduction only (V-d of C-11-HED: 59.1+/-25.2 vs 71.0+/-18.8 mL/g tissue, NS). There were no differences in myocardial blood now between the groups, and plasma norepinephrine was within normal limits in patients and control subjects. Conclusions-The findings demonstrate a significant reduction of myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor density in patients with ARVC. This may result from a secondary downregulation after increased local synaptic norepinephrine levels caused by increased firing rates of the efferent neurons or as the result of impaired presynaptic catecholamine reuptake. These findings give new insights into the pathophysiology of arrhythmogenesis in ARVC, with potential impact on diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic management.

Monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) is one of the promising targets for the imaging of astrogliosis in he human brain. A novel selective and reversible MAO-B tracer, (S)-(2-methylpyrid-5-yl)-6-[(3- F-18-fluoro-2-hydroxy)propoxy]quinoline (F-18-SMBT-1), was successfully developed via lead optimization from the first-generation tau PET tracer F-18-THK-5351. Methods: SMBT-1 was radiolabeled with F-18 using the corresponding precursor. The binding affinity of radiolabeled compounds to MAO-B was assessed using saturation and competitive binding assays. The binding selectivity of F-18-SMBT1 to MAO-B was evaluated by autoradiography of frozen human brain tissues. The pharmacokinetics and metabolism were assessed in normal mice after intravenous administration of F-18-SMBT-1. A 14d toxicity study after the intravenous administration of F-18-SMBT-1 was performed using rats and mice. Results: In vitro binding assays demonstrated a high binding affinity of F-18-SMBT-1 to MAO-B (dissociation constant, 3.7 nM). In contrast, it showed low binding affinity to MAO-A and protein aggregates such as amyloid-beta and tau fibrils. Autoradiographic analysis showed higher amounts of F-18-SMBT-1 binding in the Alzheimer disease brain sections than in the control brain sections. F-18-SMBT-1 binding was completely displaced with the reversible MAO-B inhibitor lazabemide, demonstrating the high selectivity of F-18-SMBT-1 for MAO-B. Furthermore, F-18-SMBT-1 showed a high uptake by brain, rapid washout, and no radiolabeled metabolites in the brain of normal mice. F-18-SMBT-1 showed no significant binding to various receptors, ion channels, or transporters, and no toxic effects related to its administration were observed in mice and rats. Conclusion: F-18-SMBT-1 is a promising and selective MAO-B PET tracer candidate, which would be useful for quantitative monitoring of astrogliosis in the human brain.

To determine the effectiveness of these ligands, the internalised fraction over time is derived from cell studies. Parameters, such as the ligand concentration and the number of cells, are experiment-specific and therefore a comparison between ligands is difficult. A more objective approach that allows better comparison is desirable. Therefore, the aim of this work was to develop a compartmental model that fully describes all relevant pharmacokinetic interactions of PSMA-specific ligands with prostate cancer cells. Methods: Internalisation studies were performed using the lymph node carcinoma of the prostate cell line LNCaP C4-2 and the prostatic carcinoma cell line PC-3. A new protocol was established for the determination of the PSMA-binding specificity by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The experimental data in combination with parameters from literature were used for the modelling approach. Results: A compartmental model which includes the relevant physiological mechanisms was developed. The basic model structure and some parameters originate from the literature. The PSMA-specific association and dissociation rates of Ga-PSMA-11 were measured using surface plasmon resonance technology. The ligand-induced internalisation and PSMA synthesis rates were estimated by fitting the developed model to experimental data obtained using LNCaP C4-2 cells. For all [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 concentrations and including four various incubation times, the ligand-induced internalisation was determined to be (3.6 +/- 0.1) % min(-1). Conclusions: The presented approach is a prerequisite for better estimation and thus comparison of important ligand-cell interaction parameters, by combining SPR measurements, cell experiments and mathematical modelling. Advances in Knowledge and implications for patient: A compartmental model was developed for evaluation and comparison of PSMA-binding small molecules. A SPR protocol was established for the determination of PSMA-binding specificity. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The use of positron emission tomography (PET) to measure ligand displacement has allowed estimation of endogenous dopamine release in the human brain; however, applying this methodology to assess central 5-HT release has proved more challenging. The aim of this study was to assess the sensitivity of a highly selective 5-HT1A partial agonist radioligand [C-11]CUMI-101 to changes in endogenous 5-HT levels induced by an intravenous challenge with the selective 5-HT re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI), citalopram, in healthy human participants. We studied 15 healthy participants who underwent PET scanning in conjunction with ([1)1C]CUMI-101 after receiving an intravenous infusion of citalopram 10 mg or placebo in a double-blind, crossover, randomized design. Regional estimates of binding potential (BPND) were obtained by calculating total volumes of distribution (V-T) for presynaptic dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and postsynaptic cortical regions. Relative to placebo, citalopram infusion significantly increased [C-11]CUMI-101 BPND at postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors in several cortical regions, but there was no change in binding at 5-HT1A autoreceptors in the DRN. Across the postsynaptic brain regions, citalopram treatment induced a mean 7% in [C-11]CUMI-101 BPND (placebo 1.3 (0.2); citalopram 1.4 (0.2); paired t-test P = 0.003). The observed increase in postsynaptic [C-11]CUMI-101 availability identified following acute citalopram administration could be attributable to a decrease in endogenous 5-HT availability in cortical terminal regions, consistent with preclinical animal studies, in which acute administration of SSRIs decreases DRN cell firing through activation of 5-HT1A autoreceptors to reduce 5-HT levels in postsynaptic regions. We conclude that [C-11]CUMI-101 may be sensitive to changes in endogenous 5-HT release in humans.

Quantification of receptor-ligand binding with [<SUP>18</SUP>F]fluciclatide in metastatic breast cancer patients	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						Positron emission tomography; Angiogenesis; [F-18]Fluciclatide; Kinetic modelling; RGD; Integrin alpha(nu)beta(3/5)	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; INTEGRIN ALPHA(V)BETA(3); PET; EXPRESSION; KINETICS; BIODISTRIBUTION; ALPHA-V-BETA-3; F-18-AH111585; MODELS	Purpose The purpose of the study was to estimate the receptor-ligand binding of an arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptide in somatic tumours. To this aim, we employed dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) data obtained from breast cancer patients with metastases, studied with the alpha(nu)beta(3/5) integrin receptor radioligand [F-18] fluciclatide. Methods First, compartmental modelling and spectral analysis with arterial input function were performed at the region of interest (ROI) level in healthy lung and liver, and in lung and liver metastases; compartmental modelling was also carried out at the pixel level. The selection of the most appropriate indexes for tumour/healthy tissue differentiation and for estimation of specific binding was then assessed. Results The two-tissue reversible model emerged as the best according to the Akaike Information Criterion. Spectral analysis confirmed the reversibility of tracer kinetics. Values of kinetic parameters, estimated as mean from parametric maps, correlated well with those computed from ROI analysis. The volume of distribution VT was on average higher in lung metastases than in the healthy lung, but lower in liver metastases than in the healthy liver. In agreement with the expected higher alpha(nu)beta(3/5) expression in pathology, k(3) and k(3)/k(4) were both remarkably higher in metastases, which makes them more suitable than VT for tumour/healthy tissue differentiation. The ratio k(3)/k(4), in particular, appeared a reasonable measure of specific binding. Conclusion Besides establishing the best quantitative approaches for the analysis of [F-18]fluciclatide data, this study indicated that the k(3)/k(4) ratio is a reasonable measure of specific binding, suggesting that this index can be used to estimate alpha(nu)beta(3/5) receptor expression in oncology, although further studies are necessary to validate this hypothesis.

Testosterone increases blood flow and expression of androgen and estrogen receptors in the rat vagina	JOURNAL OF SEXUAL MEDICINE			English	Article						testosterone; vaginal blood flow; androgen receptor	SURGICALLY MENOPAUSAL WOMEN; SEX STEROID-HORMONES; ANIMAL-MODEL; DESIRE DISORDER; AROUSAL; OVARIECTOMY; DYSFUNCTION; ESTRADIOL; PATCH; TIME	Introduction. The mechanisms by which testosterone modulates female genital sexual arousal responses are poorly understood. Aim. To investigate the effects of testosterone on vaginal blood flow and the expression of estrogen and androgen receptor proteins in the rat vagina. Methods. Mature female Sprague-Dawley rats were sham-operated (intact) or ovariectomized. Fourteen days after ovariectomy, animals were continuously infused with vehicle or varying doses of testosterone (5.5-55 mu g/day). After 2 weeks of treatment, vaginal blood flow in response to pelvic nerve stimulation was measured by laser Doppler flowmetry. Plasma levels of testosterone and estradiol were determined by radioimmunoassay and epithelial thickness was examined in fixed vaginal tissue sections. Androgen and estrogen receptor levels were assessed by equilibrium radioligand binding and by Western blot analyses. Results. Vaginal blood flow responses were significantly reduced in ovariectomized rats and normalized in animals infused with testosterone. Ovariectomy increased the expression of estrogen receptors and reduced the expression of androgen receptors with no change in receptor-ligand affinity. Testosterone increased the expression of both androgen and estrogen receptors in the vagina. While physiological (11 mu g/day) and supraphysiological (55 mu g/day) concentrations of testosterone normalized vaginal tissue weight, uterine tissue and whole body weights were not significantly different from ovariectomized rats infused with vehicle. Testosterone infusion, even at supraphysiological concentrations, did not change plasma estradiol levels when compared to vehicle-infused, ovariectomized rats. Likewise, the vaginal epithelium of testosterone-infused rats remained atrophic, similar to vehicle-infused, ovariectomized rats, indicating that testosterone is not aromatized to estrogens at significant levels in the vagina. Conclusions. Our data suggest that testosterone regulates androgen and estrogen receptor protein expression in the vagina and enhances vaginal perfusion by an androgen-dependent mechanism. We conclude that testosterone plays an important role in modulating the physiology of the vagina and contributes to improvement of genital sexual arousal responses.

The novel benzhydrylpiperazine compound DPI-221 [4-((alpha-S)-alpha-((2S,5R)-2,5dimethyl- 4-(3-fluorobenzyl)-1-piperazinyl)benzyl)-N,N-diethylbenzamide] was characterized as having delta receptor selectivity using radioligand binding (K-i = 2.0 +/- 0.7 nM, delta receptor; 1800 +/- 360 nM, mu receptor; and 2300 +/- 680 nM, kappa receptor), and agonist activity was demonstrated in the mouse isolated vas deferens where DPI-221 inhibited electrically induced contractions with an IC50 value of 88 +/- 7.5 nM. In the guinea pig isolated ileum, DPI-221 had no effect on electrically induced contractions at concentrations as high as 1 mu M. Sterile saline was infused (7 ml/h) into the bladder of Sprague-Dawley rats, via a transmural catheter; DPI-221 (1.0 to 20 mg/kg p.o.) significantly increased the interval between micturition events, whereas peak void pressure was not significantly decreased by any dose of DPI-221. The micturition effects of 10 mg/kg p.o. DPI-221 were blocked by naltrindole, indicating a delta receptor mechanism of action. In isolated rat bladder strips, DPI-221 was ineffective at relaxing detrusor muscle precontracted with carbachol. The most crucial safety aspect of delta agonist administration is the incidence of seizure-like convulsions in rodents. DPI-221 produced no convulsions at doses up to 100 mg/kg p.o. in mice, although rapid bolus i.v. injection of 5 mg/kg produced convulsions in 3% of mice tested. These findings indicate a good safety profile for DPI-221 administered orally, with potent efficacy in modifying bladder activity.

Y-maze test and step-through test revealed that teaming ability and memory were impaired in the three models and were improved by oral administration of ZMS. ZMS did not inhibit acetylcholinesterase nor did it occupy the binding sites of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M receptor), hence it is neither an cholinesterase inhibitor nor an agonist or antagonist of M receptors. On the other hand, the densities of total M receptor and its M-1 subtype in the brain of the three models were significantly lower than control rats, and ZMS significantly raised the densities of total M receptors and its M-1 subtype. Linear regression revealed significant correlation between the teaming ability/memory and the density of either total M receptor or its M-1 subtype. Autoradiographic study with H-3-pirenzipine showed that the M-1 subtype density was significantly lowered in cortex, hippocampus and striatum of aged rats, and ZMS could reverse these changes towards normal control level. Interestingly, the M-1 receptor density after ZMS administration only approached but did not exceed that of normal young control rats. Therefore, ZMS seems to represent a new approach to the pharmacological regulation of teaming and memory and appears to be not simply palliative but may modify the progression of the disease.

J	Govitrapong, P; Sawlom, S; Ebadi, M				Govitrapong, P; Sawlom, S; Ebadi, M			The presence of delta and mu-, but not kappa or ORL<sub>1</sub> receptors in bovine pinealocytes	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						delta; mu; kappa; opioid receptor-like receptors; pinealocyte; melatonin	OPIOID BINDING-SITES; GUINEA-PIG; LIGAND-BINDING; BETA-ENDORPHIN; MELATONIN; SUBTYPES; RAT; ENKEPHALIN; RHYTHM; GLAND	Physicians have noted since antiquity that their patients complained of less pain and required fewer analgesics at night-time. In humans, the circulating levels of melatonin, a pineal substance with analgesic and hypnotic properties, exhibit a pronounced circadian rhythm with serum levels being high at night and low during day-time. Moreover, pinealectomy abolishes the analgesic effects of melatonin, and naloxone disrupts the day-night rhythm of nociception. In this study, we have attempted to identify and characterize the nature and types 3 of opioid receptor in bovine pinealocyte membranes, using a radioligand binding technique with the selective radioligands [H-3]DAMGO, [H-3]DPDPE, [H-3]U69593 and [H-3]orphanin-FQ (OFQ) for identifying mu delta (mu)-, kappa (kappa)- and opioid receptor-like (ORL1) receptors, respectively. The saturation experiments on bovine pinealocyte membranes for [H-3]DPDPE binding provided B-max and K-d values of 553+/-24 fmol/mg protein and 1.3+/-0.6 nM; and for [H-3]DAMGO binding provided B-max and K-d values of 6.3+/-1.3 fmol/mg protein and 1.2+/-0.4 nM, respectively. On the other hand, the specific radioligands ([H-3]U69593 and [H-3]OFQ) binding of kappa and ORL, receptors were undetectable in bovine pinealocyte membranes. Furthermore, competitive experiments with opioid agonist and antagonist and related compounds confirmed the presence of mu- and delta-opioid binding sites in bovine pinealocyte membranes. These results indicate that neither kappa nor ORL1 receptors are present on the pinealocytes, and the majority of opioid receptors found in the bovine pineal gland are delta (possibly, both delta(1) and delta(2)) types, with a minority being mu type, and that both are primarily located on the bovine pinealocyte membranes. These opioid receptors, by stimulating the activity of N-acetyltransferase, enhance the synthesis of melatonin. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Of the detergents tested, 1% CHAPS (3-[(3-deoxycholic acid (cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate) yielded optimal conditions for solubilisation (in the presence of 3 mg/ml protein, 44% of receptor was solubilised, 50% of total protein was solubilised). An antipeptide antibody was raised against a 15 amino-acid sequence within the predicted third intracellular loop region of the human and rat adenosine A(2A) receptor. The antibody was coupled to protein A immobilised on sepharose CL-4B and used to immunoprecipitate adenosine A(2A) receptors from solubilised rat striatal preparations. Radioligand-binding studies were performed using the selective adenosine A(2) antagonist [H-3]ZM 241385 (4-(2-[7-amino-2-(2-furyl)[1,2,4]triazolo[2,3-a][1,3,5]triazin-5-ylamino]ethyl)phenol). Using [H-3]ZM 241385, the pharmacology of immunoprecipitated adenosine A(2A) receptors was composed to striatal membrane bound adenosine A(2A) receptors and detergent solubilised adenosine A(2A) receptors. [H-3]ZM 241385 labelled a single saturable binding site with high affinity in all three preparations (membrane bound K-d 2.7 nM +/- 1.0; solubilised K-d 1.9 nM +/- 0.3; immunoprecipitated K-d 2.2 nM +/- 0.7). Additionally, all three assays confirmed a rank order of potency for displacers consistent with adenosine A(2A) receptor pharmacology: ZM 241385 > KW 6002 ((E)-8-[2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethynyl]-1-3-diethyl-3,7-dihydro-7'-methyl-1-purine 2,6 dione) > CGS 21680, (2-(4-(2 carboxyethyl)phenylethylamino)-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine) > DPCPX (8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine). We conclude that we have solubilised and immunoprecipitated adenosine A(2A) receptors from rat striatum and that their pharmacology is consistent with native striatal adenosine A(2A) receptors.

New developments point to the potential use of these types of radioligands for tumor-specific radionuclide therapy. Patients and methods: We have comparatively investigated the diagnostic capacity of the SST analog, In-111-DOTA-lanreotide (LAN), as opposed to In-111-DOTA-DPhe(1)-Tyr(3)-octreotide (TOCT) in tumor patients. This article gives an overview of recent scintigraphic results compared to CT/MRI, F-18-FDG-PET, endoscopy and/or surgery in a threshold of 218 tumor patients. Results: As opposed to radiology, previously unknown tumor lesions were demonstrable by either SST radioligand in about one third of patients. In carcinoid patients, the SST scan sensitivity was 64% for LAN (18 of 28) and 87% (34 of 39) for TOCT, whereas the sensitivity was 100% in patients with (radioiodine-negative) thyroid cancer (17 of 17) for LAN and 95% for TOCT (20 of 21). Discordant scintigraphic results between LAN and TOCT (higher tumor uptake and/or visualisation of different lesions in the same patient) were also seen in patients with lymphoma, lung cancer and intestinal adenocarcinoma. In a direct comparison of both SST tracers in 38 tumor patients, LAN gave positive results in 35 of 38, TOCT in 36 of 38 and 18F-FDG-PET in 14 of 22 of the same patients. SST scan results obtained by both tracers were equivocal in 23 of 38 patients, but were better in 10 patients with TOCT and in 5 patients with LAN. Conclusions: We conclude that both SST radioligands are suitable tracers for tumor imaging, but may give significantly different uptake results for different tumor types. Since the uptake is most important for tumor therapy, using either long-acting SST analogs, and/or Y-90-labeled analogs, careful evaluation should be made prior to therapy.

The goal of this study was to evaluate methods to derive 5-HT1A receptor parameters in the human brain with positron emission tomography (PET) and [carborzyl-C-11]WAY 100635. Five healthy volunteer subjects were studied twice. Three methods of analysis were used to derive the binding potential (BP), and the specific to nonspecific equilibrium partition coefficient (k(3)/k(4)). Two methods, kinetic analysis based on a three compartment model and graphical analysis, used the arterial plasma time-activity curves as the input function to derive BP and k(3)/k(4). A third method, the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM), derived the input function from uptake data of a region of reference, the cerebellum, and provided only k(3)/k(4). All methods provided estimates of regional 5-HT1A receptor parameters that were highly correlated. Results were consistent with the known distribution of 5-HT1A receptors in the human brain. Compared with kinetic BP, graphical analysis slightly underestimated BP, and this phenomenon was mostly apparent in mall size-high noise regions. Compared with kinetic k(3)/k(4), the reference tissue method underestimated k,flc, and the underestimation was apparent primarily in regions with high receptor density. Derivation of BP by both kinetic and graphical analysis was highly reliable, with an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.84 +/- 0.14 (mean +/- SD of 15 regions) and 0.84 +/- 0.19, respectively. In contrast, the reliability of k(3)/k(4) was lower, with ICC of 0.53 +/- 0.28, 0.47 +/- 0.28, and 0.55 +/- 0.29 for kinetic, graphical, and reference tissue methods, respectively. In conclusion, derivation of BP by kinetic analysis using the arterial plasma input function appeared as the method of choice because of its higher test-retest reproducibility, lower vulnerability to experimental noise, and absence of bias.

Problems associated with side effects of ibogaine have spawned a search for more effective and safer structural derivatives. 18-Methoxycoronaridine (18-MC), a novel iboga alkaloid congener, appears to have substantial potential for broad use as an anti-addictive therapy. Like ibogaine (40 mg/kg), 18-MC (40 mg/kg) decreases the intravenous self-administration of morphine and cocaine and the oral self-administration of ethanol and nicotine in rats; unlike ibogaine, 18-MC does not affect responding for a non-drug reinforcer (water), Ibogaine and 18-MC appear to reduce the reinforcing efficacies, rather than the potencies, of drugs of abuse. Both ibogaine and 18-MC decrease extracellular levels of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens while only ibogaine increases serotonin levels in this brain region. Both ibogaine and 18-MC block morphine-induced and nicotine-induced dopamine release in the accumbens; only ibogaine enhances cocaine-induced increases in dopamine levels. Ibogaine produces whole body tremors and, at high doses (at least 100 mg/kg), cerebellar damage; 18-MC does not produce these effects. Ibogaine, but not 18-MC, causes bradycardia at high doses, Ibogaine and its metabolite noribogaine have low mu M affinities for kappa and mu opioid receptors, NMDA receptors, 5HT-3 receptors, sigma-2 sites, sodium channels and the serotonin transporter. 18-MC has low mu M affinities at all three opioid receptors and at 5HT-3 receptors but much lower or no affinities for NMDA and sigma-2 receptors, sodium channels, and the 5HT transporter, Both 18-MC and ibogaine are sequestered in fat and, like ibogaine, 18-MC probably has an active metabolite. 18-MC also has (+) and (-) enantiomers, both of which are active. Considered together, all of the data indicate that 18-MC should be safer than ibogaine and at least as efficacious as an anti-addictive medication.

The aim of this study is to compare the value of these 2 modalities in patients confirmed or suspicious to have metastatic prostate cancer. Patients and Methods Twenty-two patients with the mean age of 66.6 +/- 10.1 years were studied using Tc-99m-PSMA SPECT/CT and Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT, with less than 7 days interval between the 2 imaging procedures. Whole-body PET/CT was done 60 minutes after IV injection of 185 MBq (5 mCi) of Ga-68-PSMA. Tc-99m-PSMA SPECT/CT was performed 3 hours after IV injection of 555 to 740 MBq (15-20 mCi) of Tc-99m-PSMA. The images of each modality were interpreted independently, and the results were compared according to patient-based as well as region-based analyses. Results In patient-based evaluation, both Tc-99m-PSMA SPECT/CT and Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT scans were positive in 95.45% (21/22). In region-based evaluation, Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT detected 53 regions (median of 2 regions per patient; range, 0-5), whereas 43 (median of 2 regions per patient; range, 0-5) were detected by Tc-99m-PSMA SPECT/CT. Most of these differences could be explained by lower detection rate of Tc-99m-PSMA SPECT/CT in prostate bed (n = 6). PET/CT detected more involved regions than SPECT/CT (P = 0.007), whereas similar frequency of extraprostatic lesions were diagnosed in both modalities (P = 0.102). Significant correlation was also demonstrated between serum prostate-specific antigen level and imaging parameters of disease extension detected by 2 modalities. Conclusions Tc-99m-PSMA SPECT/CT could be a potential substitute for Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT in high-risk patients, except when evaluation of prostate bed is of major concern.

The Alpha-1A Adrenergic Receptor in the Rabbit Heart	PLOS ONE			English	Article							RIGHT-VENTRICULAR MYOCARDIUM; ALPHA-1-ADRENERGIC RECEPTORS; SELECTIVE ANTAGONIST; CARDIAC MYOCYTES; IN-VIVO; SUBTYPE; FAILURE; ALPHA(1D)-ADRENOCEPTORS; STIMULATION; ALPHA(1B)	The alpha-1A-adrenergic receptor (AR) subtype is associated with cardioprotective signaling in the mouse and human heart. The rabbit is useful for cardiac disease modeling, but data on the alpha-1A in the rabbit heart are limited. Our objective was to test for expression and function of the alpha-1A in rabbit heart. By quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qPCR) on mRNA from ventricular myocardium of adult male New Zealand White rabbits, the alpha-1B was 99% of total alpha-1-AR mRNA, with <1% alpha-1A and alpha-1D, whereas alpha-1A mRNA was over 50% of total in brain and liver. Saturation radioligand binding identified similar to 4 fmol total alpha-1-ARs per mg myocardial protein, with 17% alpha-1A by competition with the selective antagonist 5-methylurapidil. The alpha-1D was not detected by competition with BMY-7378, indicating that 83% of alpha-1-ARs were alpha-1B. In isolated left ventricle and right ventricle, the selective alpha-1A agonist A61603 stimulated a negative inotropic effect, versus a positive inotropic effect with the nonselective alpha-1-agonist phenylephrine and the beta-agonist isoproterenol. Blood pressure assay in conscious rabbits using an indwelling aortic telemeter showed that A61603 by bolus intravenous dosing increased mean arterial pressure by 20 mm Hg at 0.14 mu g/kg, 10-fold lower than norepinephrine, and chronic A61603 infusion by iPRECIO programmable micro Infusion pump did not increase BP at 22 mu g/kg/d. A myocardial slice model useful in human myocardium and an anthracycline cardiotoxicity model useful in mouse were both problematic in rabbit. We conclude that alpha-1A mRNA is very low in rabbit heart, but the receptor is present by binding and mediates a negative inotropic response. Expression and function of the alpha-1A in rabbit heart differ from mouse and human, but the vasopressor response is similar to mouse.	[Thomas, R.

Methods: Positron emission tomography studies were performed on six elderly healthy control (HC) subjects and seven probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with [C-11]BF227 and 10 HC subjects and 10 probable AD patients with [F-18]FACT. Data from nine regions of interest were analyzed by several approaches, namely non-linear least-squared fitting methods with arterial input functions (one-tissue compartment model(1TCM), two-tissue compartment model (2TCM)), Logan plot, and linearized methods with reference region (Reference Logan plot (RefLogan), MRTM0, MRTM2). We also evaluated SUV and SUVR for both tracers. The parameters estimated by several approaches were compared between two tracers for detectability of differences between HC and AD patients. Results: For [C-11]BF227, there were no significant difference of V-T (2TCM, 1TCM) and SUV in all regions (Student t-test; p < 0.05) and significant differences in the DVRs (Logan, RefLogan, and MRTM2) and SUVRs in six neocortical regions (p < 0.05) between the HC and AD groups. For [F-18]FACT, significant differences in DVRs (RefLogan, MRTM0, and MRTM2) were observed in more than four neocortical regions between the HC and AD groups (p < 0.05), and the significant differences were found in SUVRs for two neocortical regions (inferior frontal coretex and lateral temporal coretex). Our results showed that both tracers can clearly distinguish between HC and AD groups although the pharmacokinetics and distribution patterns in brain for two tracers were substantially different. Conclusion: This study revealed that although the PET amyloid imaging agents [C-11]BF227 and [F-18]FACT have similar chemical and biological properties, they have different pharmacokinetics, and caution must be paid for usage of the tracers.

Jeffrey			Chemical Modification of the M<sub>1</sub> Agonist VU0364572 Reveals Molecular Switches in Pharmacology and a Bitopic Binding Mode	ACS CHEMICAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Acetylcholine; GPCR; allosteric; orthosteric; agonist; antagonist	MUSCARINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; ALLOSTERIC MODULATORS; CNS PENETRANT; SUBTYPE; DISCOVERY; SYSTEM; OPPORTUNITIES; ACTIVATION; MECHANISM; AFFINITY	We previously reported the discovery of VU0364572 and VU0357017 as M-1-selective agonists that appear to activate M-1 through actions at an allosteric site. Previous studies have revealed that chemical scaffolds for many allosteric modulators contain molecular switches that allow discovery of allosteric antagonists and allosteric agonists or positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) based on a single chemical scaffold. Based on this, we initiated a series of studies to develop selective M-1 allosteric antagonists based on the VU0364572 scaffold. Interestingly, two lead antagonists identified in this series, VU0409774 and VU0409775, inhibited ACh-induced Ca2+ responses at rat M1-5 receptor subtypes, suggesting they are nonselective muscarinic antagonists. VU0409774 and VU0409775 also completely displaced binding of the nonselective radioligand [H-3]-NMS at M-1 and M-3 mAChRs with affinities similar to their functional IC50 values. Finally, Schild analysis revealed that these compounds inhibit M-1 responses through a fully competitive interaction at the orthosteric binding site. This surprising finding prompted further studies to determine whether agonist activity of VU0364572 and VU0357017 may also engage in previously unappreciated actions at the orthosteric site on M-1. Surprisingly, both VU0364572 and VU0357017 completely displaced [H-3]-NMS binding to the orthosteric site of M-1-M-5 receptors at high concentrations. Furthermore, evaluation of agonist activity in systems with varying levels of receptor reserve and Furchgott analysis using a cell line expressing M-1 under control of an inducible promotor was consistent with an action of these compounds as weak orthosteric partial agonists of M-1. However, consistent with previous studies suggesting actions at a site that is distinct from the orthosteric binding site, VU0364572 or VU0357017 slowed the rate of [H-3]-NMS dissociation from CHO-rM(1) membranes. Together, these results suggest that VU0364572 and VU0357017 act as bitopic ligands and that novel antagonists in this series act as competitive orthosteric site antagonists.

Human Biodistribution and Dosimetry of <SUP>11</SUP>C-CUMI-101, an Agonist Radioligand for Serotonin-1A Receptors in Brain	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ANTERIOR-PITUITARY; DOPAMINE-RECEPTOR; BINDING; PET	As a reported agonist, C-11-CUMI-101 is believed to selectively bind the G-protein-coupled state of the serotonin-1A (5-HT1A) receptor, thereby providing a measure of the active subset of all 5-HT1A receptors in brain. Although C-11-CUMI-101 has been successfully used to quantify 5-HT1A receptors in human and monkey brain, its radiation exposure has not previously been reported. The purpose of this study was to calculate the radiation exposure to organs of the body based on serial whole-body imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) in human subjects. Methods: Nine healthy volunteers were injected with 428 +/- 84 MBq (mean +/- SD) C-11-CUMI-101 and then imaged with a PET-only device for two hours from head to mid-thigh. Eleven source organs (brain, heart, liver, pancreas, stomach, spleen, lungs, kidneys, lumbar spine L1-5, thyroid, and urinary bladder) were identified on whole body images and used to calculate radiation doses using the software program OLINDA/EXM 1.1. To confirm that we had correctly identified the pancreas, a tenth subject was imaged on a PET/CT device. Results: Brain had high uptake (similar to 11% of injected activity (IA)) at 10 min. Although liver had the highest uptake (similar to 35% IA at 120 min), excretion of this activity was not visible in gall bladder or intestine during the scanning session. Organs which received the highest doses (microSv/MBq) were pancreas (32.0), liver (18.4), and spleen (14.5). The effective dose of 11-CCUMI-101 was 5.3 +/- 0.5 microSv/MBq. Conclusion: The peak brain uptake (similar to 11% IA) of C-11-CUMI-101 is the highest among more than twenty C-11-labeled ligands reported in the literature and provides good counting statistics from relatively low injected activities. Similar to that of other C-11-labeled ligands for brain imaging, the effective dose of C-11-CUMI-101 is 5.3 +/- 0.5 microSv/MBq, a value that can now be used to estimate the radiation risks in future research studies.

J	Schnell, D; Strasser, A; Seifert, R				Schnell, David; Strasser, Andrea; Seifert, Roland			Comparison of the pharmacological properties of human and rat histamine H<sub>3</sub>-receptors	BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Active receptor state; Histamine H-3-receptor; Imoproxifan; Molecular dynamics simulations; Sf9 insect cells	HIGH CONSTITUTIVE ACTIVITY; H-3 RECEPTOR; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; GUINEA-PIG; AGONIST BINDING; SELECTIVITY; LIGANDS; CLASSIFICATION; H-2-RECEPTOR; CLONING	Ligand pharmacology of histamine H-3-receptors is species-dependent. In previous studies, two amino acids in transmembrane domain 3 (TM III) were shown to play a significant role. In this study, we characterized human and rat histamine H-3-receptors (hH(3)R and rH(3)R, respectively), co-expressed with mammalian G proteins in Sf9 insect cell membranes. We compared a series of imidazole-containing H3R ligands in radioligand binding and steady-state GTPase assays. H(3)Rs similarly coupled to G alpha(i/o)-proteins. Affinities and potencies of the agonists histamine, N-alpha-methylhistamine and R-(alpha)-methylhistamine were in the same range. Imetit was only a partial agonist. The pharmacology of imetit and proxifan was similar at both species. However, impentamine was more potent and efficacious at rH(3)R. The inverse agonists ciproxifan and thioperamide showed higher potency but lower efficacy at rH(3)R. Clobenpropit was not species-selective. Strikingly, imoproxifan was almost full agonist at hH(3)R, but an inverse agonist at rH(3)R. Imoproxifan was docked into the binding pocket of inactive and active hH(3)R- and rH(3)R-models and molecular dynamic simulations were performed. Imoproxifan bound to hH(3)R and rH(3)R in E-configuration, which represents the trans-isomer of the oxime-moiety as determined in crystallization studies, and stabilized active hH(3)R-, but inactive rH(3)R-conformations. Large differences in electrostatic surfaces between TM III and TM V cause differential orientation of the oxime-moiety of imoproxifan, which then differently interacts with the rotamer toggle switch Trp(6.48) in TM VI. Collectively, the substantial species differences at H(3)Rs are explained at a molecular level by the use of novel H3R active-state models. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This pilot study reports the safety, biodistribution, and radiation dosimetry of [F-18]AV-45 in human subjects. Methods: In vitro autoradiography and fluorescent staining of postmortem brain tissue from patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cognitively healthy subjects were performed to assess the specificity of the tracer. Biodistribution was assessed in three healthy elderly subjects (mean age: 60.0 +/- 5.2 years) who underwent 3-h whole-body positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomographic (CT) scans after a bolus injection of 381.9 +/- 13.9 MBq of [F-18]AV-45. Another six subjects (three AD patients and three healthy controls, mean age: 67.7 +/- 13.6 years) underwent brain PET studies. Source organs were delineated on PET/CT. All subjects underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for obtaining structural information. Results: In vitro autoradiography revealed exquisitely high specific binding of [F-18]AV-45 to postmortem AD brain sections, but not to the control sections. There were no serious adverse events throughout the study period. The peak uptake of the tracer in the brain was 5.12 +/- 0.41% of the injected dose. The highest absorbed organ dose was to the gallbladder wall (184.7 +/- 78.6 mu Gy/MBq, 4.8 h voiding interval). The effective dose equivalent and effective dose values for [F-18]AV-45 were 33.8 +/- 3.4 mu Sv/MBq and 19.3 +/- 1.3 mu Sv/ MBq, respectively. Conclusion: [F-18]AV-45 binds specifically to A beta in vitro, and is a safe PET tracer for studying A beta distribution in human brain. The dosimetry is suitable for clinical and research application. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Studies suggest that [C-11]MDL100,907 PET may be quantified by non-invasive reference tissue analyses using cerebellum as reference region. We systematically investigated the validity of such analyses. Methods: Five healthy volunteers underwent [C-11]MDL100,907 PET at baseline and after mirtazapine pre-treatment. Regional time-activity curves of 10 regions of interest (ROI) were analyzed for binding potential (BPND) and mirtazapine receptor occupancy (Occ) using: simplified reference tissue model (SRTM), multi-linear reference tissue model (MRTM), their two-parameter versions (SRTM2/MRTM2), non-invasive graphical analysis (NIGA) and a tissue activity concentration ratio. NIGA was also applied voxel-wise to generate BPND maps. These methods were compared with a two-tissue compartment model with arterial input function (2TCM) Results: SRTM and MRTM frequently failed to yield reliable results. SRTM2 and MRTM2 gave virtually identical estimates of BPND, which were highly correlated with 2TCM analyses (R-2 >= 0.86) although with negative bias (-29 +/- 27% at baseline across all ROI). NIGA was less biased (-19 +/- 16%) and better correlated with 2TCM (R-2 >= 0.93). Regarding Occ, NIGA and SRTM2/MRTM2 showed Comparable mean biases (-11 +/- 27% vs. -7 +/- 47%) but correlation with 2TCM was higher for NIGA (R-2 = 0.90 vs. 0.77). NIGA parametric maps (analysed using identical ROI) resulted in moderate bias in BPND (-26 +/- 22%; R-2 >= 0.88) and Occ (-17 +/- 36%: R-2 = 0.78). Estimates obtained from tissue ratios performed least favourably. Conclusions: NIGA is well suited for analysis of [C-11]MDL100,907 PET studies, yielding estimates of 5-HT2A receptor availability and changes that are highly correlated with results from invasive 2TCM analyses. This should greatly enhance the applicability of 5-HT2A receptor PET studies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

CV Therapeutics scientists discovered the selective, high affinity A(2B) AdoR antagonist 10, a 8-(4-pyrazolyl)-xanthine derivative [CVT-6883, K-i(hA(2B)) = 22 nM; K-i(hA(1)) = 1,940 nM; K-i(hA(2A)) = 3,280; and K-i(hA(3)) = 1,070 nM] that has favorable pharmacokinetic (PK) properties (t (1/2) = 4 h and F > 35% rat). Compound 10 demonstrated functional antagonism at the A(2B) AdoR (K-B = 6 nM) and efficacy in a mouse model of asthma. In two phase 1 clinical trials, CVT-6883 was found to be safe, well tolerated, and suitable for once daily dosing. A second compound 20, 8-(5-pyrazolyl)-xanthine, has been nominated for development from Baraldi's group in conjunction with King Pharmaceuticals that has favorable A(2B) AdoR affinity and selectivity [K-i(hA(2B)) = 5.5 nM; K-i(hA(1)) > 1,000 nM; K-i(hA(2A)) > 1,000; and K-i(hA(3)) > 1,000 nM], and it has been demonstrated to be a functional antagonist. A third compound 32, a 2-aminopyrimidine, from the Almirall group has high A(2B) AdoR affinity and selectivity [K-i(hA(2B)) = 17 nM; K-i(hA(1)) > 1,000 nM; K-i(hA(2A)) > 2,500; and K-i(hA(3)) > 1,000 nM], and 32 has been moved into preclinical safety testing. Since three highly selective, high affinity A(2B) AdoR antagonists have been nominated for development with 10 (CVT-6883) being the furthest along in the development process, the role of the A(2B) AdoR in various disease states will soon be established.

Depletion of the lipid raft constituents, sphingomyelin and ganglioside, decreases serotonin binding at human 5-HT<sub>7(a)</sub> receptors in HeLa cells	ACTA PHYSIOLOGICA			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	14th Acta Physiologica International Symposium on G-Protein-Couple Receptors - From Molecular Aspects to Novel Therapy	AUG 17-18, 2006	Stockholm, SWEDEN	Swedish Sci Res Council, Novo Nordish Fund, Junior Fac/Karolinska Inst, Swedish Soc Drug Res		5-HT7 receptor; radioligand binding; lipid raft; sphingomyelin; gangliosides; PDMP; Fumonisin B1	SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION; MOLECULAR-CLONING; PROTEIN; MICRODOMAINS; CAVEOLAE; LOCALIZATION; SEGREGATION; ASTROCYTES; EXPRESSION; CYCLASE	Aim: The localization and function of several G protein-coupled receptors, including beta-adrenergic receptors and NK 1 receptors, are regulated via lipid rafts in the plasma membrane. These domains are enriched in cholesterol, gangliosides and sphingolipids, and play an important role in regulating signal transduction in most cell types. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), acting via 14 different receptors, regulates as diverse effects as mood, metabolism and smooth muscle contraction. 5-HT7 receptors are involved in the regulation of depression, circadian rhythms, thermoregulation and vasodilatation. Ligand binding and signalling via the 5-HT7 receptor are regulated by membranous cholesterol. Here we investigated the role of sphingomyelin and gangliosides on binding of 5-HT to 5-HT7 receptors to further examine the role of lipid raft constituents on 5-HT7 receptor function. Methods: HeLa cells stably transfected with the human 5-HT7 receptor were treated with Fumonisin B-1 or (+/-)-threo-1-Phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP) to reduce sphingomyelin or ganglioside levels, respectively. The effects of these treatments were investigated by the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) viability assay, cholesterol analysis and [H-3]5-HT binding studies on intact cells. Results: Treatments with 20 mu M Fumonisin B-1 for 24 h or with 10 mu M PDMP for 48 h had no effects of total levels if 5-HT7 receptors, but caused significant decreases in maximum [H-3]5-HT binding to 5-HT7 receptors. The effects were cholesterol-independent as levels of cholesterol remained unaffected by either treatment. Conclusion: These data demonstrate a role for sphingomyelin and gangliosides in regulating binding of [H-3]5-HT to 5-HT7 receptors. These observations further strengthen that actions of 5-HT via 5-HT7 receptors are dependent upon lipid raft integrity.

Most of the anti-inflammatory actions of adenosine have been attributed to signaling through the A(2A) adenosine receptor (A(2A)AR). Previously, however, it has been shown that the A(3)AR agonist N-6-(3-iodobenzyl)adenosine-5' -N-methylcarboxamide (IB-MECA) potently inhibited TNF-alpha release from macrophages obtained from A(2A)AR "knockout" (A(2A)KO) mice, suggesting that the A(3)AR may also regulate cytokine expression. Here, we confirmed that the A(2A)AR is the primary AR subtype that suppresses TNF-alpha release from thioglycollate-elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages induced by both Toll-like receptor-dependent (TLR) and TLR-independent stimuli, but we determined that the A(2B)AR rather than the A(3)AR mediates the non-A(2A)AR actions of adenosine since 1) the ability of IB-MECA to inhibit TNF-alpha release was not altered in macrophages isolated from A 3 KO mice, and 2) the A(2B)AR antagonist 1,3-dipropyl- 8-[4-[((4-cyanophenyl)carbamoylmethyl)oxy]phenyl]xanthine (MRS 1754) blocked the ability of the nonselective AR agonist adenosine-5' -N-ethylcarboxamide (NECA) to inhibit TNF-alpha release from macrophages isolated from A(2A)KO mice. Although A(2B)ARs :seem capable of inhibiting TNF-alpha release, the A(2A)AR plays a dominant suppressive role since MRS 1754 did not block the ability of NECA to inhibit TNF-alpha release from macrophages isolated from wild-type (WT) mice. Furthermore, the potency and efficacy of adenosine to inhibit TNF-alpha release from WT macrophages were not influenced by blocking A(2B)ARs with MRS 1754. The data indicate that adenosine suppresses TNF-alpha release from macrophages primarily via A(2A)ARs, although the A 2B AR seems to play an underlying inhibitory role that may contribute to the anti-inflammatory actions of adenosine under select circumstances.

Cytotoxic analogs of somatostatin (SST), such as AN-238, which consists of 2-pyrrolinodoxorubicin (AN-201) linked to the SST carrier RC-121, can be targeted to tumors that express SST receptors. Because SST receptors are present in ovarian carcinoma cells, the authors evaluated the effect of AN-238 on the UCI-107 ovarian carcinoma cell line. METHODS. An analysis of microsatellite alleles in cocultured SST receptor positive and receptor negative cells was used for the demonstration of in vitro targeting. The toxicity and antitumor effects of AN-238 in nude mice bearing UCI-107 human ovarian tumors were investigated with or without pharmacologic inhibition of serum carboxylesterases (CE). The expression of SST receptor subtypes was determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis, and the binding affinity of AN-238 to SST receptors was determined by radioligand assays. RESULTS. The proliferation of SST receptor positive UCI-107 cells in vitro was inhibited preferentially by AN-238. AN-238 showed high-affinity binding to UCI-107 tumor membranes at a 50% inhibition concentration of 3.39 nM +/- 0.74 nM. In vivo, the volume and weights of UCI-107 tumors treated with AN-238 were decreased by more than 60% (P < 0.05) compared with controls. Cytotoxic radical AN-201 or the unconjugated mixture of AN-201 with carrier RC-121 had no significant effects on tumors and were toxic. In mice with inhibited serum CE activity, AN-201 at 400 nmol/kg was lethal, whereas AN-238 at a total dose of 800 nmol/kg caused only 22% mortality and reduced tumor weight by 69% and volume by 70% (P < 0.05 vs. control). CONCLUSIONS. Targeted chemotherapy with the SST conjugate AN-238 inhibits SST receptor positive experimental ovarian tumors. AN-238 may provide a new treatment modality for patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma. (C) 2001 American Cancer Society.

J	Zhang, YC; Bui, JD; Shen, LP; Phillips, MI				Zhang, YC; Bui, JD; Shen, LP; Phillips, MI			Antisense inhibition of β<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor mRNA in a single dose produces a profound and prolonged reduction in high blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats	CIRCULATION			English	Article						gene therapy; receptors, adrenergic, beta; hypertension; contractility	IRREVERSIBLE BLOCKADE; SINOATRIAL NODE; OLIGONUCLEOTIDES; PHARMACOKINETICS; DELIVERY; GENE; TIME; EXPRESSION; LIPOSOMES; THERAPY	Background-beta-Blockers are the first line of therapy for hypertension. However, they are associated with side effects because of central nervous system (CNS) effects and beta(2)-adrenergic antagonism. To overcome these problems and provide a long-term beta(1)-blockade, antisense oligonucleotides against rat beta(1)-adrenergic receptor (beta(1)-AR) mRNA (beta(1)-AS-ODN) were designed and tested for the ability to inhibit cardiac beta(1)-ARs as well as lower blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Methods ard Results-Radioligand binding assay showed that a single intravenous injection of beta(1)-AS-ODN delivered in cationic liposomes significantly decreased cardiac beta(1)-AR density by 30% to 50% for 18 days (P<0.01), with no effect on beta(2)-ARs. This was accompanied by marked attenuation of beta(1)-AR-mediated positive inotropic response in isolated perfused hearts in vitro (P<0.02) and in conscious SHRs monitored by telemetry in vivo (P<0.02), Furthermore, the blood pressure of SHRs was reduced for 20 days, with a 38 mm Hg maximum drop. Heart rate was not significantly decreased. Quantitative autoradiography was performed to assess beta(1)-AS-ODN effects on the CNS, which demonstrated no changes in beta(1)-ARs in brain, in contrast to a significant reduction in heart and kidney (P<0.05). For comparison with beta-blockers, the effects of atenolol on cardiovascular hemodynamics were examined, which lowered blood pressure for only 10 hours and elicited appreciable bradycardia in SHRs. Conclusions-These results indicate that beta(1)-AS-ODN, a novel approach to specific beta(1)-blockade, has advantages over currently used beta-blockers in providing a profound and prolonged reduction in blood pressure without affecting heart rate, beta(2)-ARs, and the CNS. Diminished cardiac contractility resulting from less beta(1)-AR expression contributes to the antihypertensive effect.

AIM To assess the association of HTR3 polymorphisms with depressive, anxiety, and somatization symptoms in individuals with IBS. METHODS In this retrospective study, 623 participants with IBS were recruited from five specialty centers in Germany, Sweden, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Ireland. Depressive, anxiety, and somatization symptoms and sociodemographic characteristics were collected. Four functional SNPs - HTR3A c.-42C > T, HTR3B c.386A > C, HTR3C c.489C > A, and HTR3E c.*76G > A - were genotyped and analyzed using the dominant and recessive models. We also performed separate analyses for sex and IBS subtypes. SNP scores were calculated as the number of minor alleles of the SNPs above. The impact of HTR3C c.489C > A was tested by radioligand-binding and calcium influx assays. RESULTS Depressive and anxiety symptoms significantly worsened with increasing numbers of minor HTR3C c.489C > A alleles in the dominant model (F-depressive = 7.475, P-depressive = 0.006; F-anxiety = 6.535, P-anxiety = 0.011). A higher SNP score (range 0-6) was linked to a worsened depressive symptoms score (F = 7.710, P-linear trend = 0.006) in IBS. The potential relevance of the HTR3C SNP was corroborated, showing changes in the expression level of 5-HT(3)AC variant receptors. CONCLUSION We have provided the first evidence that HTR3C c.489C > A is involved in depressive and anxiety symptoms in individuals with IBS. The SNP score indicated that an increasing number of minor alleles is linked to the worsening of depressive symptoms in IBS. (c) The Author(s) 2022. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

Pain is often stressful and counterbalanced by activation of CRF receptors along the nociceptive pathway, although the involvement of the CRF receptor subtypes 1 and/or 2 (CRF-R1 and CRF-R2, respectively) in CRF-induced analgesia remains controversial. Thus, the aim of the present study was to examine CRF-R1 and CRF-R2 expression within the spinal cord of rats with Freund's complete adjuvant-induced unilateral inflammation of the hind paw using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, radioligand binding, and immunofluorescence confocal analysis. Moreover, the antinociceptive effects of intrathecal (i.t.) CRF were measured by paw pressure algesiometer and their possible antagonism by selective antagonists for CRF-R1 and/or CRF-R2 as well as for opioid receptors. Our results demonstrated a preference for the expression of CRF-R2 over CRF-R1 mRNA, protein, binding sites and immunoreactivity in the dorsal horn of the rat spinal cord. Consistently, CRF as well as CRF-R2 agonists elicited potent dose-dependent antinociceptive effects which were antagonized by the i.t. CRF-R2 selective antagonist K41498, but not by the CRF-R1 selective antagonist NBI35965. In addition, i.t. applied opioid antagonist naloxone dose-dependently abolished the i.t. CRF- as well as CRF-R2 agonist-elicited inhibition of somatic pain. Importantly, double immunofluorescence confocal microscopy of the spinal dorsal horn showed CRF-R2 on enkephalin (ENK)-containing inhibitory interneurons in close opposition of incoming mu-opioid receptor-immunoreactive nociceptive neurons. CRF-R2 was, however, not seen on pre- or on postsynaptic sensory neurons of the spinal cord. Taken together, these findings suggest that i.t. CRF or CRF-R2 agonists inhibit somatic inflammatory pain predominantly through CRF-R2 receptors located on spinal enkephalinergic inhibitory interneurons which finally results in endogenous opioid-mediated pain inhibition.

Furthermore, solid data on the potential benefits of acidic and varinic phytocannabinoids in a variety of diseases are already available. Mode of action of cannabigerol (CBG), cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), cannabigerolic acid (CBGA), cannabidivarin (CBDV) and cannabigerivarin (CBGV) is, to the very least, partial. Hypothesis/Purpose: Cannabinoid CB1 or CB2 receptors, which belong to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, are important mediators of the action of those cannabinoids. Pure CBG, CBDA, CBGA, CBDV and CBGV from Cannabis sativa L. are differentially acting on CB1 or CB2 cannabinoid receptors. Study Design: Determination of the affinity of phytocannabinoids for cannabinoid receptors and functional assessment of effects promoted by these compounds when interacting with cannabinoid receptors. Methods: A heterologous system expressing the human versions of CB1 and/or CB2 receptors was used. Binding to membranes was measured using radioligands and binding to living cells using a homogenous time resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (HTRF) assay. Four different functional outputs were assayed: determination of cAMP levels and of extracellular-signal-related-kinase phosphorylation, label-free dynamic mass redistribution (DMR) and beta-arrestin recruitment. Results: Affinity of cannabinoids depend on the ligand of reference and may be different in membranes and in living cells. All tested phytocannabinoids have agonist-like behavior but behaved as inverse-agonists in the presence of selective receptor agonists. CBGV displayed enhanced potency in many of the functional outputs. However, the most interesting result was a biased signaling that correlated with differential affinity, i.e. the overall results suggest that the binding mode of each ligand leads to specific receptor conformations underlying biased signaling outputs. Conclusion: Results here reported and the recent elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of CB1 and CB2 receptors help understanding the mechanism of action that might be protective and the molecular drug-receptor interactions underlying biased signaling.

The deubiquitinase ubiquitin-specific protease 20 is a positive modulator of myocardial β<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor expression and signaling	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						ubiquitylation (ubiquitination); protein kinase A (PKA); lysosome; G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR); endocytosis	IN-VIVO; CARDIAC DYSFUNCTION; BETA(2)-ADRENERGIC RECEPTOR; PHOSPHOINOSITIDE 3-KINASE; PLASMA NOREPINEPHRINE; ADRENERGIC-RECEPTORS; CONTRACTILE FUNCTION; TARGETED DISRUPTION; HEART-FAILURE; KINASE 1	Reversible ubiquitination of G protein-coupled receptors regulates their trafficking and signaling; whether deubiquitinases regulate myocardial beta(1)-adrenergic receptors (beta(1)ARs) is unknown. We report that ubiquitin-specific protease 20 (USP20) deubiquitinates and attenuates lysosomal trafficking of the beta(1)AR. beta(1)AR-induced phosphorylation of USP20 Ser-333 by protein kinase A-alpha (PKA alpha) was required for optimal USP20-mediated regulation of beta(1)AR lysosomal trafficking. Both phosphomimetic (S333D) and phosphorylation-impaired (S333A) USP20 possess intrinsic deubiquitinase activity equivalent to WT activity. However, unlike USP20 WT and S333D, the S333A mutant associated poorly with the beta(1)AR and failed to deubiquitinate the beta(1)AR. USP20-KO mice showed normal baseline systolic function but impaired beta(1)AR-induced contractility and relaxation. Dobutamine stimulation did not increase cAMP in USP20-KO left ventricles (LVs), whereas NKH477-induced adenylyl cyclase activity was equivalent to WT. The USP20 homolog USP33, which shares redundant roles with USP20, had no effect on beta(1)AR ubiquitination, but USP33 was up-regulated in USP20-KO hearts suggesting compensatory regulation. Myocardial beta(1)AR expression in USP20-KO was drastically reduced, whereas beta(2)AR expression was maintained as determined by radioligand binding in LV sarcolemmal membranes. Phospho-USP20 was significantly increased in LVs of wildtype (WT) mice after a 1-week catecholamine infusion and a 2-week chronic pressure overload induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Phospho-USP20 was undetectable in beta(1)AR KO mice subjected to TAC, suggesting a role for USP20 phosphorylation in cardiac response to pressure overload. We conclude that USP20 regulates beta(1)AR signaling in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, beta(1)AR-induced USP20 phosphorylation may serve as a feed-forward mechanism to stabilize beta(1)AR expression and signaling during pathological insults to the myocardium.

N-Acetyl cysteine NAC) was conjugated to ATRIDAT as a specific targeting agent toward L-type and ASC amino acid transporter systems in the oncogenic cells. NAC was attached via S-alkylation to prevent its incorporation at undesired recognition sites affecting the signal-to-noise ratio. NAC-ATRIDAT was subjected to gallium-68 complexation with >75% radiolabeling yield. The radiocomplex was purified through the tc18 cartridge to obtain 99.89% radiochemical yield. IC-50 of the NAC-ATRIDAT conjugate was 0.8 mM in A549 cells as evaluated through 3-4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazonium bromide assay. Binding affinity experiments on A549 cells showed noteworthy binding with K-D in the nanomolar range. A time course study showed a K-m value of 0.19 mu M and V-max value of 0.49 pmol/mu g protein/min showing reasonable tumor kinetics. Efflux studies showed that the synthesized radioligand is transported majorly by LAT followed by the ASC system. Clearance was found to be renal with 7.67 +/- 1.48% ID/g uptake at 30 min which substantially declined to 0.52 +/- 0.% ID/g at 4 h. A significant uptake of 10.06 +/- 1.056% ID/g was observed at the tumor site in mice at 1 h. mu PET images revealed a high contrast with a tumor-to-kidney ratio of 4.8 and a tumorto- liver ratio of 35.85 at 1 h after injection. These preclinical in vitro and in vivo evaluation supports its potential on the way of becoming a successful Ga-68-radiolabeled amino acid-based PET imaging agent.

We retrospectively report our clinical observations using 4 different treatment activities. Methods: Forty patients with advanced prostate cancer and positive uptake in prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) imaging were treated with 4 GBq of Lu-177 activity/80 nmol of precursor, 6 GBq of Lu-177 activity/120 nmol of precursor, 7.4 GBq of Lu-177 activity/150 nmol of precursor, or 9.3 GBq of Lu-177 activity/150 nmol of precursor (10 patients per group) every 2 mo. Safety was checked every 2 wk by laboratory tests, the prostate-specific antigen response was checked every 4 wk, and other effects were assessed by anamnesis. Results: The initial prostate-specific antigen response showed no correlation with treatment activity. However, 2 of 10, 4 of 10, 4 of 10, and 7 of 10 patients receiving doses of 4, 6, 7.4, and 9.3 GBq, respectively, were in partial remission 8 wk after completing all 3 cycles. This finding would be in line with but-because of low patient numbers-would not prove a positive dose-response relationship. Acute hematologic toxicity was also not correlated with treatment activity, and no more than 1 patient per group had grade 3/4 toxicity. Nevertheless, in contrast to the findings for the other groups, the mean platelet count in the 9.3-GBq group decreased chronically over time. Conclusion: If patients with diffuse red marrow infiltration and extensive chemotherapeutic pretreatments are excluded, then treatment activities of up to 3 injections of 9.3 GBq of Lu-177-PSMA-617 every 2 mo are tolerated well. Further dose escalation should be conducted with care, as the highest dose seems to be close to the maximum tolerable dose.

The active constituent responsible for its pharmacological effects is bacoside A, a mixture of dammarane-type triterpenoid saponins containing sugar chains linked to a steroid aglycone skeleton. Triterpenoid saponins have been reported to be transformed in vivo to metabolites that give better biological activity and pharmacokinetic characteristics. Thus, the activities of the parent compounds (bacosides), aglycones (jujubogenin and pseudojujubogenin) and their derivatives (ebelin lactone and bacogenin A(1)) were compared using a combination of in silico and in vitro screening methods. The compounds were docked into 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, D-1, D-2, M-1 receptors and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) using AutoDock and their central nervous system (CNS) drug-like properties were determined using Discovery Studio molecular properties and ADMET descriptors. The compounds were screened in vitro using radioligand receptor binding and AChE inhibition assays. In silico studies showed that the parent bacosides were not able to dock into the chosen CNS targets and had poor molecular properties as a CNS drug. In contrast, the aglycones and their derivatives showed better binding affinity and good CNS drug-like properties, were well absorbed through the intestines and had good blood brain barrier (BBB) penetration. Among the compounds tested in vitro, ebelin lactone showed binding affinity towards M-1 (K-i = 0.45 mu M) and 5-HT2A (4.21 mu M) receptors. Bacoside A and bacopaside X (9.06 mu M) showed binding affinity towards the D-1 receptor. None of the compounds showed any inhibitory activity against AChE. Since the stimulation of M-1 and 5-HT2A receptors has been implicated in memory and cognition and ebelin lactone was shown to have the strongest binding energy, highest BBB penetration and binding affinity towards M-1 and 5-HT2A receptors, we suggest that B. monnieri constituents may be transformed in vivo to the active form before exerting their pharmacological activity.

Whilst the ECS has been shown to be involved in immune system regulation in various ways, it is known that infections during pregnancy can modulate the immune system of the mother and increase the risk for schizophrenia in offspring. In animal studies, maternal immune activation following administration of viral or bacterial mimics has been shown to reproduce many key structural, behavioural, and pharmacological abnormalities in offspring that resemble schizophrenia. In the present study, we used Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and [F-18]MK-9470, a selective high-affinity inverse agonist radioligand for cannabinoid type 1 receptors (CB1R), to longitudinally assess CB1R expression in the progeny of female rats exposed to the viral mimic polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidilic acid (poly I:C) (4 mg/kg i.v.) or vehicle at gestational day 15 (GD 15). PET scans were performed in offspring at postnatal days (PND) 32-42 (adolescence) and in the same animals again at PNDs 75-79 (adulthood). Sixteen regions of interest were assessed, encompassing the whole rat brain. At adolescence, offspring exposed prenatally to poly I:C had significantly lower CB1R relative Standard Uptake Values (rSUV) compared to controls in the globus pallidus (p = 0.046). In adulthood, however, poly I:C exposed offspring had higher levels of CB1R rSUV in sensory cortex (p = 0.034) and hypothalamus (p = 0.032) compared to controls. Our results suggest that prenatal poly I:C leads to long term alterations in the integrity of the ECS that are age and region-specific. The increased CB1R expression in adulthood following poly I:C mirrors the increased CB1R observed in patients with schizophrenia in post-mortem and in vivo PET studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

These insecticides act as noncompetitive antagonists (channel blockers) for insect GABARs by binding to a site within the intrinsic channel of the GABAR. Recently, a novel class of insecticides, 3-benzamido-N-phenylbenzamides (BPBs), was shown to inhibit GABARs by binding to a site distinct from the site for fiproles. We examined the binding site of BPBs in the adult housefly by means of radioligand-binding and electrophysiological experiments. 3-Benzamido-N-(2,6-dimethyl-4-perfluoroisopropylphenyl)-2-fluorobenzamide (BPB 1) (the N-demethyl BPB) was a partial, but potent, inhibitor of [H-3]4'-ethynyl-4-n-propylbicycloorthobenzoate (GABA channel blocker) binding to housefly head membranes, whereas the 3-(N-methyl)benzamido congener (the N-methyl BPB) had low or little activity. A total of 15 BPB analogs were tested for their abilities to inhibit [H-3]BPB 1 binding to the head membranes. The N-demethyl analogs, known to be highly effective insecticides, potently inhibited the [H-3]BPB I binding, but the N-methyl analogs did not even though they, too, are considered highly effective. [H-3]BPB equally bound to the head membranes from wild-type and dieldrin-resistant (rdl mutant) houseflies. GABA allosterically inhibited [H-3]BPB 1 binding. By contrast, channel blocker-type antagonists enhanced [H-3]BPB 1 binding to housefly head membranes by increasing the affinity of BPB 1. Antiparasitic macrolides, such as ivermectin B-1a, were potent inhibitors of [H-3]BPB 1 binding. BPB 1 inhibited GABA-induced currents in housefly GABARs expressed in Xenopus oocytes, whereas it failed to inhibit L-glutamate-induced currents in inhibitory L-glutamate receptors. Overall, these findings indicate that BPBs act at a novel allosteric site that is different from the site for channel blocker-type antagonists and that is probably overlapped with the site for macrolides in insect GABARs.

Analysis of the actions of the novel dopamine receptor-directed compounds (<i>S</i>)-OSU6162 and ACR16 at the D<sub>2</sub> dopamine receptor	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						OSU6162; ACR16; dopamine stabilizers; D-2 dopamine receptor; radioligand binding; stimulation of [35S]GTP gamma S binding; allosteric effects	ANTIPSYCHOTIC-DRUGS; INVERSE AGONISM; (-)-OSU6162; MECHANISMS; EFFICACY; BINDING	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The two phenylpiperidines, OSU6162 and ACR16, have been proposed as novel drugs for the treatment of brain disorders, including schizophrenia and Huntington's disease, because of their putative dopamine stabilizing effects. Here we evaluated the activities of these compounds in a range of assays for the D-2 dopamine receptor in vitro. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH The affinities of these compounds for the D-2 dopamine receptor were evaluated in competition with [3H]spiperone and [3H]NPA. Agonist activity of these compounds was evaluated in terms of their ability to stimulate [35S]GTP gamma S binding. KEY RESULTS Both compounds had low affinities for inhibition of [3H]spiperone binding (pK(i) vs. [3H]spiperone, ACR16: < 5, OSU6162: 5.36). Neither compound was able to stimulate [35S]GTP gamma S binding when assayed in the presence of Na+ ions, but if the Na+ ions were removed, both compounds were low-affinity, partial agonists (E-max relative to dopamine: ACR16: 10.2%, OSU6162:54.3%). Schild analysis of the effects of OSU6162 to inhibit dopamine-stimulated [35S]GTP gamma S binding indicated Schild slopes of similar to 0.9, suggesting little deviation from competitive inhibition. OSU6162 was, however, able to accelerate [3H]NPA dissociation from D-2 dopamine receptors, indicating some allosteric effects of this compound. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS The two phenylpiperidines were low-affinity, low-efficacy partial agonists at the D-2 dopamine receptor in vitro, possibly exhibiting some allosteric effects. Comparing their in vitro and in vivo effects, the in vitro affinities were a reasonable guide to potencies in vivo. However, the lack of in vitro-in vivo correlation for agonist efficacy needs to be further addressed.

J	Baker, JG				Baker, Jillian G.			The selectivity of β-adrenoceptor agonists at human β<sub>1</sub>-, β<sub>2</sub>- and β<sub>3</sub>-adrenoceptors	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						beta-adrenoceptor; beta-blocker; beta-agonist; beta-antagonist; cAMP; drug selectivity; whole-cell binding; subtype selectivity; efficacy; intrinsic efficacy; GPCR	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; GUINEA-PIG; HUMAN BETA(2)-ADRENOCEPTOR; INTRINSIC EFFICACY; PROVIDE EVIDENCE; ACTIVATION; BETA(1)-ADRENOCEPTOR; BLOCKERS; AFFINITY; SUBTYPES	Background and purpose: There are two important properties of receptor-ligand interactions: affinity (the ability of the ligand to bind to the receptor) and efficacy (the ability of the receptor-ligand complex to induce a response). Ligands are classified as agonists or antagonists depending on whether or not they have efficacy. In theory, it is possible to develop selective agonists based on selective affinity, selective intrinsic efficacy or both. This study examined the affinity and intrinsic efficacy of 31 beta-adrenoceptor agonists at the three human beta-adrenoceptors to determine whether the current agonists are subtype selective because of affinity or intrinsic efficacy. Experimental approach: Stable clonal CHO-K1 cell lines, transfected with either the human beta(1), beta(2) or beta(3)-adrenoceptor, were used, and whole-cell [3H]-CGP 12177 radioligand binding and [3H]-cAMP accumulation were measured. Key results: Several agonists were found to be highly subtype selective because of selective affinity (e.g. salmeterol and formoterol, for the beta(2)-adrenoceptor over the beta(1) or beta(3)), while others (e.g. isoprenaline) had little affinity-selectivity. However, the intrinsic efficacy of salmeterol, formoterol and isoprenaline was similar across all three receptor subtypes. Other ligands (e.g. denopamine for beta(1); clenbuterol, AZ 40140d, salbutamol for beta(2)) were found to have subtype-selective intrinsic efficacy. Several ligands appeared to activate two agonist conformations of the beta(1)- and beta(3)-adrenoceptors. Conclusions and implications: There are agonists with subtype selectivity based upon both selective affinity and selective intrinsic efficacy. Therefore, there is scope to develop better selective agonists based upon both selective affinity and selective intrinsic efficacy.

These observations were supported by estimates of CGP-12177A binding affinity at alpha(1)-adrenoceptors, which have been always performed in rat cerebral cortex membranes, as a Surrogate of vascular tissue. Since alpha(1D)-adrenoceptors are predominant in both rat aorta and mesenteric artery, in the present study, we measured, for the first time, the binding affinity of CGP-12177A at recombinant rat alpha(1D)-adrenoceptors expressed in BHK-21 cell membranes. CGP-12177A binding affinity was also determined in rat cerebral cortex membranes, where various alpha(1)-adrenoceptor subtypes are present. By means of [H-3]prazosin binding competition experiments, we found that CGP-12177A bound to alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor-expressing BHK-21 cell membranes, with a binding affinity (pK(i)=5.39 +/- 0.27) almost identical to that measured in cerebral membranes (pK(i)=5.44 +/- 0.07), indicating that it is a non-subtype selective alpha(1)-adrenoceptor ligand. Moreover, CGP-12177A binding affinity was very close to its functional affinity evaluated in rat aorta in terms of antagonist potency against phenylephrine-induced contraction (pK(B)=5.65 +/- 0.07). In conclusion, our results demonstrate that, in order to evaluate CGP-12177A binding affinity at aorta and mesenteric artery alpha(1)-adrenoceptors, estimates in rat cerebral membranes are as reliable as those in recombinant rat alpha(1D)-adrenoceptors, since both values are very close to CGP-12177A functional affinities in isolated vessels.

Pharmacological and functional characterization of novel EP and DP receptor agonists: DP1 receptor mediates penile erection in multiple species	JOURNAL OF SEXUAL MEDICINE			English	Article						prostaglandin D-2; prostaglandin E-1; organ bath	CAVERNOSUM SMOOTH-MUSCLE; HUMAN CORPUS CAVERNOSUM; TRANSURETHRAL ALPROSTADIL; INTRACAVERNOSAL ALPROSTADIL; PROSTANOID RECEPTORS; PROSTAGLANDIN D-2; CONSCIOUS MICE; DYSFUNCTION; HYPERALGESIA; RAT	Introduction. Despite the widespread use of prostaglandin E, as an efficacious treatment for male erectile dysfunction for more than two decades, research on prostanoid function in penile physiology has been limited. Aim. To characterize the pharmacological and physiological activity of novel subtype-selective EP and DP receptor agonists. Methods. Radioligand binding and second messenger assays were used to define receptor subtype specificity of the EP and DP agonists. Functional activity was further characterized using isolated human and rabbit penile cavernosal tissue in organ baths. In vivo activity was assessed in rabbits and rats by measuring changes in cavernous pressure after intracavernosal injection of receptor agonists. Main Outcome Measures. Receptor binding and signal transduction, smooth muscle contractile activity, erectile function. Results. In organ bath preparations of human cavernosal tissue contracted with phenylephrine, EP2- and EP4-selective agonists exhibited variable potency in causing relaxation. One of the compounds caused mild contraction, and none of the compounds was as effective as PGE(1) (EC50= 0.23 mu M). There was no consistent correlation between the pharmacological profile (receptor binding and second messenger assays) of the EP agonists and their effect on cavernosal tissue tone. In contrast, the DP1-selective agonist AS702224 (EC50 =29 nM) was more effective in relaxing human cavernosal tissue than either PGE(1), PGD(2) (EC50 = 58 nM), or the DP agonist BW245C (EG(50) =59 nM). In rabbit cavernosal tissue, PGE(1) and PGD(2) caused only contraction, while AS702224 and BW245C caused relaxation. Intracavernosal administration of AS702224 and BW245C also caused penile tumescence in rabbits and rats. For each compound, the erectile response improved with increasing dose and was significantly higher than vehicle alone. Conclusions. These data suggest that AS702224 is a potent DP1-selective agonist that causes penile erection. The DP1 receptor mediates relaxation in human cavernosal tissue, and stimulates pro-erectile responses in rat and rabbit. Thus, rabbits and rats can be useful models for investigating the physiological function of DP1 receptors.

Study of auto- and heteroreceptor components of the presynaptic dopamine reuptake modulation in the mechanism of the in vitro action of the novel antiparkinsonian drug hemantane	NEUROCHEMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						dopamine; synaptosomes; reuptake; NMDA receptors; nonNMDA receptors; Parkinson disease; antiparkinsonian drug; adamantane derivatives	PARKINSONS-DISEASE; RECEPTOR; RELEASE; D-3; NEURONS; VIVO	The effect of Hemantane, a new 2-aminoadamantane derivative (N-adamant-2-ylhexamethylenimine hydrochloride) with antiparkinsonian activity on [H-3]-dopamine ([H-3]-DA) uptake and binding by D1, D2, and D3 dopamine and NMDA glutamate receptors was studied in comparison with the clinically used drug Amantadine. The method of radioligand binding to rat striatal membrane preparations was used. Both drugs, when used within a concentration range of 10(-11) to 10(-3) M did not affect the[G-H-3]-SCH23390 and [G-H-3]-Spiperone binding by D1 and D2 receptors. However, at micromolar concentrations (> 10(-5) M), Hemantane and Amantadine inhibited the binding of the D3 receptor ligand 7-OH-[G-H-3]-DPAT with IC50 values of 39 and 360 mu M, respectively; i.e., Hemantane is almost one order of magnitude more efficient. Both preparations exhibited a similar effect on NMDA receptors: the semiinhibition constants IC50 were 5.5 mu M for Hemantane and 4 mu M for Amantadine. Hemantane and Amantadine were shown to reproducibly inhibit the reuptake of [H-3]-dopamine at concentrations of 100-500 mu M. The study of inhibition kinetics demonstrated the noncompetitive character of the action: Hemantane decreased the B-max value from 9.0 (control) to 5.1 pmol of [H-3]-DA per min/mg of protein (p < 0.05), whereas K-m value remained constant (0.5 mu M), which is characteristic of the noncompetitive type of inhibition. The (+/-)CPP and MK-801 antagonists of NMDA receptors inhibited the reuptake of [H-3]-DA with IC50 of 6 and 38 mu M, respectively; NMDA (1, 10, and 100 mu M) had no effect; and quisqualate, an agonist of nonNMDA receptors, moderately (-37%, p < 0.05) inhibited dopamine transport at 100 mu M. These data seem to indicate that the mechanism of increase of dopaminergic transfer under the action of adamantane derivatives could involve noncompetitive inhibition of dopamine transport.

It has been implicated that the comparatively long N-terminal tail of the alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor is responsible for the inefficient surface expression of the receptor. 2 In the present study, we created gene constructs for six N-terminally truncated variants of the human alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor. These constructs were used to transfect Neuro2A cells. We show that the density of alpha(1D)-adrenoceptors, observed by [H-3]-prazosin binding, gradually increased with longer truncations of the N-terminus. This seems to indicate that the long N-terminal tail nonspecifically interferes with receptor translocation to the plasma membrane. 3 The addition of a 16 amino acids long signal peptide to the N-terminus of the wild-type alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor increased the density of receptor binding sites 10-fold in Neuro2A and COS-7 cells. This indicates that, after the addition of a signal peptide, the long N-terminal tail of the alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor does not interfere with proper translocation of the receptor to the plasma membrane. This, in turn, indicates that the N-terminal tail of the wild-type alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor, merely by its long length, hinders the first transmembrane helix of the receptor from being a signal anchor. 4 Neither the wild-type alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor (for which the expression level of [H-3]-prazosin binding sites is low) nor the truncated alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor variant (for which the expression level of [H-3]-prazosin binding sites is high) showed any constitutive activity in stimulating inositol phosphate accumulation. This indicates that the low expression level of [H-3]-prazosin binding sites, after transfection with the wild-type alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor, is not caused by constitutive activity of the receptor and subsequent receptor downregulation.

In the present study, we investigated the effect of a novel AMPA receptor potentiator (LY404187) and its active isomer (LY451646) on the expression of BDNF protein and mRNA, as well as TrkB mRNA in rat hippocampus. LY404187 administered for 7 days (1 mg/kg) significantly increased the number of BDNF immunopositive cells in the dentate gyrus, but not other hippocampal subfields. Chronic treatment (7 days) with LY451646 (0.5 mg/kg, comparable to 1 mg/kg of LY404187) increased the level of both BDNF and TrkB mRNA expression in the dentate gyrus, CA3 and CA4 of the hippocampus. However, chronic treatment with lower doses of LY451646 (0.125 and 0.25 mg/kg) decreased the level of BDNF and TrkB mRNA in hippocampus, whilst the hi-hest used dose of LY451646 (I mg/kg) had no effect on BDNF and TrkB mRNA in hippocampus. In contrast, acute treatment with LY451646 produced an increase in BDNF mRNA levels at doses of 0.125 and 0.25 mg/kg in the hippocampus (CA4, CA3 and dentate gyrus, but not in CA1). LY451646 at 0.5 mg/kg had no effect, but at 1.0 mg/ka decreased the level of BDNF mRNA in hippocampus. Acute treatment with LY451646 did not affect the TrkB receptor mRNA levels in hippocampus. Our results demonstrate that biarylpropylsulfonamide AMPA receptor potentiators are capable of modulating the expression of BDNF and TrkB mRNA in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The increase in both BDNF protein and mRNA expression in the dentate Gyrus but not in CA1 indicates a specific role of AMPA receptors in the regulation of BDNF expression in this hippocampal subfield. The regulation of BDNF expression by biarylpropylsulfonamids such as LY451646 may have important therapeutical implications for this class of molecule in the treatment of depression and other CNS disorders.

Since Type 2 diabetes is a familial disorder, we tested this hypothesis by investigating the prevalence of GAD65 and IA-2 autoantibodies (Ab) in Type 2 diabetes multiplex families of Sardinian ancestry enrolled in the Study Group for the Genetics of Diabetes in Sardinia. Methods: A total of 684 individuals were ascertained from 252 Sardinian Type 2 diabetes multiplex families with 2.4 affected siblings per family comprising 190 families with two affected, 37 with three, 15 with four, 7 with five, and 3 with six, in addition to 80 unaffected siblings. Controls were household contacts representing 204 healthy spouses of affected siblings. Diagnosis was at 35-69 years of age and insulin was not given in the first 4 years after diagnosis. GAD65Ab and IA-2Ab were determined in standard radioligand binding assays. Results: Among affected siblings GAD65Ab were positive in 8.8% of insulin-treated (n = 137; P = 0.0006), in 2.5% of non-insulin-treated (n = 467), and in 1.2% of non-diabetic siblings (n = 80) compared with 0.5% of controls (n = 204). IA-2Ab was positive in 6.6% insulin-treated (P=0.04), 2.1% non-insulin-treated, and 2.5% non-diabetic siblings compared with 1.5% of controls. Conclusion: A high frequency of GAD65Ab and IA-2Ab as markers of Type 1 diabetes was found among Type 2 diabetes siblings from Sardinian multiplex families despite excluding those who had been treated with insulin during the first 4 years of disease. Our data support the hypothesis that LADA may be common in Sardinian Type 2 diabetes and stress the importance of investigating markers of Type 1 diabetes in studies of Type 2 diabetes.

In radioligand binding assays on Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell membranes expressing the individual human M-1 to M-5 mAChR subtypes, both dimers [(3S)-1,4-bis(3-[(3-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octanyl)-1,2,5-thiadiazol-4-yloxy]-1- propyn-1-yl)benzene,2-L-(+)-tartrate (NNC 11-1607) and (3S)1,3-bis-(3-[(3-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octanyl)-1,2,5-thiadiazol-4-yloxy]-1-propyn-1-yl)benzene,2-L-(+)-tartrate (NNC 11-1585)] exhibited higher binding affinities than the monomeric NNC 11-1314. Only NNC 11-1585, however, displayed significant selectivity for the M-1 and M-2 mAChRs relative to the other subtypes. Although binding studies in rat brain homogenates supported the selectivity profile of NNC 11-1585 observed in the CHO membranes, rat heart membrane experiments revealed complex binding behavior for all three agonists that most likely reflected differences in species and host cell environment between the heart and CHO cells. Subsequent functional assays with phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis revealed that all three novel ligands were partial agonists relative to the full agonist oxotremorine-M at the CHO M-1, M-3, and M-5 mAChRs, with NNC 11-1607 displaying the highest functional selectivity. In the CHO M-2 and M-4 mAChR cells, agonist-mediated effects on forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation were characterized by bell-shaped concentration-response curves, with the exceptions of NNC 11-1607, which had no discernible effects at the M-2 mAChR, and NNC 11-1585, which could only inhibit cAMP accumulation at the M-4 mAChR. Thus, we identified NNC 11-1607 as a novel functionally selective M-1/M-4 mAChR agonist. Our data suggest that dimerization of mAChR agonists is a viable approach in designing more potent and functionally selective agonists, as well as in providing novel tools with which to probe the nature of agonism at these receptors.

The objective of this work was to determine whether the brain kinetics of high-affinity radioligands for dopamine D1 ([H-3]SCH 23390) and D2 ([I-123]epidepride) receptors were altered by a prolonged elevation of synaptic dopamine induced by the potent cocaine analog RTI-55. Mice were injected intravenously with radioligands either 30 min after or 4 h before intraperitoneal administration of RTI-55 (2 mg/kg). In separate experiments, the pharmacological effects of RTI-55 were assessed biochemically by measuring uptake of dopamine in synaptosomes prepared from RTI-treated mice and behaviorally by monitoring locomotor activity. Consistent with the expected elevation of synaptic dopamine, RTI-55 induced a long-lasting decrement in dopamine uptake measured ex vivo, and a prolonged increase in locomotor activity. RTI-55 injected prior to the radioligands induced a significant(P < 0.05) increase in striatal concentration of [I-123]epidepride at 15 min, relative to saline-treated controls, but there were no differences between the two groups at later time-points. For [H-3]SCH 23390, both initial striatal uptake and subsequent clearance were slightly increased by preadministration of RTI-55. Administration of RTI-55 4 h after the radioligands (i.e., when it was presumed that a state of near equilibrium binding of the radioligands had been reached), was associated with a significant reduction of striatal radioactivity for both radiotracers. Our results are consistent with increased competition between dopamine and radioligand for binding to both D1 and D2 receptors after treatment with RTI-55. We suggest that the magnitude of the competition is reduced by failure of the receptor binding of high-affinity radioligands to rapidly attain equilibrium. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

The target compounds were evaluated using in vivo behavioral assays for hallucinogen-like and 6-HT1A agonist activity and in vitro radioligand competition assays for their affinity at 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, and 5-HT1A receptor sites. Functional activity at the 5-HT2A receptor was determined for all compounds. In addition, for some compounds functional activity was determined at the 5-HT1A receptor. Hallucinogen-like activity, evaluated in the two-lever drug discrimination paradigm using LSD-trained rats, was attenuated or abolished for all of the fluorinated analogues. One of the tryptamines, 4-fluoro-5-methoxy-DMT (6), displayed high 5-HT1A agonist activity, with potency greater than that of the 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT. The ED50 Of 6 in the two-lever drug discrimination paradigm using rats trained to discriminate the 5-HT1A agonist LY293284 was 0.17 mu mol/kg, and the K-i at [H-3] 8-OH-DPAT-labeled 5-HT1A receptors was 0.23 nM. The results indicate that fluorination of hallucinogenic tryptamines generally has little effect on 5-HT2A/2C receptor affinity or intrinsic activity. Affinity at the 5-HT1A receptor was reduced, however, in all but one example, and all of the compounds tested were full agonists but with reduced functional potency at this serotonin receptor subtype. The one notable exception was 4-fluoro-5-methoxy-DMT (6), which had markedly enhanced 5-HT1A receptor affinity and functional potency. Although it is generally considered that hallucinogenic activity results from 5-HT2A receptor activation, the present results suggest a possible role for involvement of the 5-HT1A receptor with tryptamines.

Herein, we immobilized the haloalkane dehalogenase (Halo)-tagged beta(2)-AR on the 6-chlorocaproic acid-modified microspheres. Using the affinity stationary phase, the interactions of four ligands with the receptor were analyzed by stepwise frontal analysis. The association constants were (4.75 +/- 0.28)x10(4) M-1 for salbutamol, (2.93 +/- 0.15)x10(4) M-1 for terbutaline, (1.23 +/- 0.03)x10(4) M-1 for methoxyphenamine, (5.67 +/- 0.38)x10(4) M-1 for clorprenaline at high-affinity binding site, and (2.73 +/- 0.05)x10(3) M-1 at low-affinity binding site. These association constants showed the same rank order as the radioligand binding assay, demonstrating that immobilized beta(2)-AR had capacity to screen bioactive compounds binding to the receptor while stepwise frontal analysis could predict their binding affinities. Application of the immobilized receptor in analysis of MFXD by chromatographic method revealed that ephedrine, aconifine, karakoline, and chasmanine were the bioactive compounds targeting beta(2)-AR. Among them, ephedrine and chasmanine exhibited association constants of (2.94 +/- 0.02)x10(4) M(-1)and (4.60 +/- 0.15)x10(4) M-1 to the receptor by stepwise frontal analysis. Molecular docking analysis demonstrated that ephedrine, chasmanine, and the other two compounds interact with beta(2)-AR through the same pocket involving the key amino acids such as Asn312, Asp113, Phe289, Trp286, Tyr316, and Val114. As such, we reasoned that the four compounds dominate the therapeutic effect of MFXD against asthma through beta(2)-AR mediating pathway. This work shed light on the potential of immobilized beta(2)-AR for drug discovery and provided a valuable methodology for rapid screening.

Studying occupancy of the GLP-1R in various tissues is challenging due to lack of quantitative, repeatable assessments of GLP-1R density. The present study aimed to describe the quantitative distribution of GLP-1Rs and occupancy by endogenous GLP-1 during oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in pigs, a species that is used in biomedical research to model humans. Research design and methods GLP-1R distribution and occupancy were measured in pancreas and gastrointestinal tract by ex vivo autoradiography using the GLP-1R-specific radioligand Lu-177-exendin-4 in two groups of pigs, control or bottle-fed an oral glucose load. Positron emission tomography (PET) data from pigs injected with Ga-68-exendin-4 in a previous study were used to retrieve data on biodistribution of GLP-1R in the gastrointestinal tract. Results High homogenous uptake of Lu-177-exendin-4 was found in pancreas, and even higher uptake in areas of duodenum. Low uptake of Lu-177-exendin-4 was found in stomach, jejunum, ileum and colon. During OGTT, there was no increase in plasma GLP-1 concentrations and occupancy of GLP-1Rs was low. The ex vivo autoradiography results were highly consistent with to the biodistribution of Ga-68-exendin-4 in pigs scanned by PET. Conclusion We identified areas with similarities as well as important differences regarding GLP-1R distribution and occupancy in pigs compared with humans. First, there was strong ligand binding in the exocrine pancreas in islets. Second, GLP-1 secretion during OGTT is minimal and GLP-1 might not be an important incretin in pigs under physiological conditions. These findings offer new insights on the relevance of porcine diabetes models.

Methods In animal studies, micro-PET imaging and bio-distribution were performed to examine the specificity of(124)I-trastuzumab in HER2-positive and HER2-negative mouse models. Subsequently,I-124-trastuzumab was applied in human clinic trial. Six gastric cancer patients with metastases underwent(124)I-trastuzumab PET imaging, with(18)F-FDG PET/CT in each to compare. Results In animal studies, PET imaging of(124)I-trastuzumab showed significant higher tumor uptake than that of(124)I-IgG1 in HER2-positive PDX mouse models at 24 h. The low tumor uptake of(124)I-trastuzumab in HER2-negative PDX models further confirmed the specificity. In human clinical studies, 18 HER2-positive lesions and 11 HER2-negative lesions were evaluated in PET imaging analysis. The detection sensitivity of(124)I-trastuzumab was 100% (18/18) at 24 h. The PET images showed significant difference in tumor uptake between HER2-positive and HER2-negative lesions at 24 h (SUVmax 7.83 +/- 0.55 vs. 1.75 +/- 0.29,p < 0.0001). Quite striking difference in tumor uptake was observed between(124)I-trastuzumab and(18)F-FDG (SUVmax 1.75 +/- 0.29 vs. 6.46 +/- 0.44,p < 0.0001) in HER2-negative lesions, further confirming the specific binding of(124)I-trastuzumab in HER2-positive lesions. The radiation-absorbed dose was calculated to be 0.3011 +/- 0.005 mSv/MBq. No toxicities or adverse effects were observed in any of the patients. Conclusion The findings described here demonstrated that(124)I-trastuzumab was feasible to detect HER2-positive lesions in primary and metastatic gastric cancer patients and to differentiate HER2-positive and HER2-negative lesions quantitatively.

LOBP has been attributed to beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (B2AR) downregulation, a process requiring farnesylation, which is inhibited by alendronate. Objective: We sought to determine whether alendronate can reduce LABA-associated LOBP in inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-treated patients. Methods: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-design, proof-of-concept trial. Seventy-eight participants with persistent asthma receiving 250 mg of fluticasone twice daily for 2 weeks were randomized to receive alendronate or placebo while initiating salmeterol for 8 weeks. Salmeterol-protected methacholine challenges (SPMChs) and PBMC B2AR numbers (radioligand binding assay) and signaling (cyclic AMP ELISA) were assessed before randomization and after 8 weeks of ICS plus LABA treatment. LOBP was defined as a more than 1 doubling dose reduction in SPMCh PC20 value. Results: The mean doubling dose reduction in SPMCh PC20 value was 0.50 and 0.27 with alendronate and placebo, respectively (P = .62). Thirty-eight percent of participants receiving alendronate and 33% receiving placebo had LOBP (P = .81). The after/before ICS plus LABA treatment ratio of B2AR number was 1.0 for alendronate (P = .86) and 0.8 for placebo (P = .15; P = .31 for difference between treatments). The B2AR signaling ratio was 0.89 for alendronate (P = .43) and 1.02 for placebo (P = .84; P = .44 for difference). Changes in lung function and B2AR number and signaling were similar between those who did and did not experience LOBP. Conclusion: This study did not find evidence that alendronate reduces LABA-associated LOBP, which relates to the occurrence of LOBP in only one third of participants. LOBP appears to be less common than presumed in concomitant ICS plus LABA-treated asthmatic patients. B2AR downregulation measured in PBMCs does not appear to reflect LOBP.

This study used the TSPO-specific PET radioligand [(11) C]PBR28 to confirm binding of ONO-2952 to brain TSPO in human subjects, and evaluate brain TSPO occupancy and its relationship with ONO-2952 plasma concentration. Sixteen healthy subjects received a single oral dose of 200, 60, 20, or 6 mg ONO-2952 (n=4 per dose). Two PET scans with [(11) C]PBR28 were conducted 7 days apart: at baseline and 24 h after ONO-2952 administration. [(11) C]PBR28 regional distribution volume (V-T) was derived with kinetic modeling using the arterial input function and a two tissue compartment model. Nonspecific binding (V-ND) was obtained on an individual basis for each subject using linear regression as the x-intercept of the Lassen plot. The binding potential relative to V-ND (BPND) was derived as the difference between V-T in the ROI (V-T ROI) and V-ND, normalized to V-ND; BPND=(V-T ROI - V-ND)/V-ND. TSPO occupancy was calculated as the change in BPND (BPND) from individual's baseline scan to the on-medication scan to the baseline BPND value. TSPO occupancy by ONO-2952 was dose dependent between 20-200 mg, approaching saturation at 200 mg both in the whole brain and in 15 anatomic regions of interest (ROI). Estimated K-i values ranged from 24.1 to 72.2 nM. This open-label, single-center, single-dose study demonstrated engagement of ONO-2952 to brain TSPO. The relationship between pharmacokinetics and TSPO occupancy observed in this study support the hypothesis that ONO-2952 could potentially modulate neurosteroid production by binding to brain TSPO.

Non-competitive Inhibition of Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors by Ladybird Beetle Alkaloids	NEUROCHEMICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; Torpedo muscle nicotinic receptor; Xenopus oocyte	ION CHANNEL; PRECOCCINELLINE; COCCINELLINE; HIPPODAMINE; DIMENSIONS; MYRRHINE; SUBUNIT; COMPLEX; ANT	Ladybird beetles (Family Coccinellidae) secrete an alkaloid rich venom from their leg joints that protects them from predators. Coccinellines, the major venom constituents, are alkaloids composed of three fused piperidine rings that share a common nitrogen atom. Although many coccinellines have been isolated and chemically characterized, their pharmacological properties are essentially unknown. Using radioligand binding and functional assays we investigated the actions of several coccinellines on skeletal muscle and alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). The alkaloids were shown to displace the specific binding of tritiated piperidyl-N-(1-(2-thienyl)cyclohexyl)-3,4-piperidine ([H-3]-TCP), which has been shown to bind deep within the ion channel of the electric fish (Torpedo) muscle nAChR. The stereoisomers precoccinelline and hippodamine (whose nitrogens are predicted to be ionized at physiological pH) and their respective analogs N-methyl-precoccinelline and N-methyl-hippodamine (whose quaternary nitrogens are permanently charged) displayed similar IC(50)s for inhibition of [H-3]-TCP binding. However, the corresponding precoccinelline and hippodamine N-oxides, coccinelline and convergine (which have an electronegative oxygen bonded to an electropositive nitrogen) displayed significantly higher binding IC(50)s. Finally, exochomine, a dimeric coccinelline containing the hippodamine structure, displayed the highest IC50 (lowest affinity) for displacing specific [H-3]-TCP binding. The presence of a desensitizing concentration (10(-3) M) of carbachol (CCh) had little or no effect on the affinity of the Torpedo nAChR for the three coccinellines tested. High concentrations of the coccinellid alkaloids did not affect binding of [H-3]-cytisine to Torpedo receptor ACh binding sites. Inhibition of the alpha7 nAChR with pre-equilibrated precoccinelline was insurmountable with respect to ACh concentration. We conclude that the coccinellines bind to one or more allosteric sites rather than to the ACh binding sites, and inhibit nAChR responses to ACh through a non-competitive mechanism. Future chemical and pharmacological investigations of other ladybird beetle alkaloids are likely to reveal other interesting alkaloids affecting ligand-gated receptors.

The F-18-labeled amyloid tracer, [F-18]2-[(2-{(E)-2-[2-(dimethylamino)-1,3-thiazol-5-yl]vinyl}-1,3-benzoxazol-6-yl)oxy]-3-fluoropropan-1-ol (FACT), one of the benzoxazole derivatives, was recently developed. In the present study, deposition of amyloid senile plaques was measured by positron emission tomography (PET) with both [C-11]Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) and [F-18]FACT in the same subjects, and the regional uptakes of both radiotracers were directly compared. Methods Two PET scans, one of each with [C-11]PIB and [F-18]FACT, were performed sequentially on six normal control subjects, two mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and six AD patients. The standardized uptake value ratio of brain regions to the cerebellum was calculated with partial volume correction using magnetic resonance (MR) images to remove the effects of white matter accumulation. Results No significant differences in the cerebral cortical uptake were observed between normal control subjects and AD patients in [F-18]FACT studies without partial volume correction, while significant differences were observed in [C-11]PIB. After partial volume correction, the cerebral cortical uptake was significantly larger in AD patients than in normal control subjects for [F-18]FACT studies as well as [C-11]PIB. Relatively lower uptakes of [C-11]PIB in distribution were observed in the medial side of the temporal cortex and in the occipital cortex as compared with [F-18]FACT. Relatively higher uptake of [C-11]PIB in distribution was observed in the frontal and parietal cortices. Conclusion Since [F-18]FACT might bind more preferentially to dense-cored amyloid deposition, regional differences in cerebral cortical uptake between [C-11]PIB and [F-18]FACT might be due to differences in regional distribution between diffuse and dense-cored amyloid plaque shown in the autoradiographic and histochemical assays of postmortem AD brain sections.

Since externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS) is one of the early molecular events during apoptosis, Annexin B1 (AnxB1), a member of Annexins family with high affinity toward the head group of PS, could be a potential positron emission tomography (PET) imaging probe for imaging cell death process after labeled by positron-emitting nuclides, such as F-18. In the present study, we investigated a novel PET probe, F-18-labeled Annexin B1 (F-18-AnxB1), for apoptosis imaging. F-18-AnxB1 was prepared reliably by conjugating AnxB1 with a F-18-tag, N-succinimidyl 4-[F-18]fluorobenzoate ([F-18]SFB), in a radiolabeling yield of about 20 % within 40 min. The in vitro binding of F-18-AnxB1 with apoptotic cells induced by anti-Fas antibody showed twofold increase compared to those without treatment, confirmed by flow cytometric analysis with AnxV-FITC/PI staining. Stability tests demonstrated F-18-AnxB1 was rather stable in vitro and in vivo without degradation. The serial F-18-AnxB1 PET/CT scans in healthy rats outlined its biodistribution and pharmacokinetics, indicating a rapid renal clearance and predominant accumulation into kidney and bladder at 2 h p.i. F-18-AnxB1 PET/CT imaging was successfully applied to visualize in vivo apoptosis sites in tumor induced by chemotherapy and in kidney simulated by ischemia-reperfusion injury. The high-contrast images were obtained at 2 h p.i. to delineate apoptotic tumor. Apoptotic region could be still identified by F-18-AnxB1 PET 4 h p.i., despite the high probe retention in kidneys. In summary, we have developed F-18-AnxB1 as a PS-specific PET probe for the apoptosis detection and quantification which could have broad applications from disease diagnosis to treatment monitoring, especially in the cases of cancer.

It has been reported that the PR3 protease from human neutrophil releases an alternate peptide of 13 amino acids, Met-Lys-BK-Ser-Ser, from high molecular weight kininogen. We have studied vascular actions of this kinin. Its affinity for recombinant B-1 and B-2 receptors is very low, as assessed by the binding competition of [H-3]Lys-des-Arg(9)-BK and [H-3]BK, respectively, but Met-Lys-BK-Ser-Ser effectively displaced a fraction of [H-3]enalaprilat binding to recombinant ACE. Mutant recombinant ACE constructions revealed that affinity gap between BK and Met-Lys-BK-Ser-Ser is larger for the N-terminal catalytic site than for the C-terminal one, based on competition for the substrate Abz-Phe-Arg-Lys(Dnp)-Pro-OH in an enzymatic assay. Met-Lys-BK-Ser-Ser is a low potency stimulant of the rabbit aorta (bioassay for B-1 receptors), but the human isolated umbilical vein, a contractile bioassay for the B-2 receptors, responded to Met-Lys-BK-Ser-Ser more than expected from the radioligand binding assay, this agonist being similar to 30-fold less potent than BK in the vein. Venous tissue treatment with the ACE inhibitor enalaprilat reduced the apparent potency of Met-Lys-BK-Ser-Ser by 15-fold, while not affecting that of BK. In the rabbit isolated jugular vein, Met-Lys-BK-Ser-Ser is nearly as potent as BK as a contractile stimulant of endogenous B-2 receptors (EC50 values of 16.3 and 10.5 nM, respectively), but enalaprilat reduced the potency of Met-Lys-BK-Ser-Ser 13-fold while increasing that of BK 5.3-fold. In vascular tissue, ACE assumes a paradoxical activating role for Met-Lys-BK-Ser-Ser. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The Alpha-1D Is the Predominant Alpha-1-Adrenergic Receptor Subtype in Human Epicardial Coronary Arteries	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY			English	Article						adrenergic; alpha and beta; arteries; coronary disease; receptors	BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERPLASIA; ALPHA(1)-ADRENERGIC RECEPTORS; CARDIAC MYOCYTES; MESSENGER-RNAS; ALPHA(1B); ALPHA(1B)-ADRENOCEPTOR; CONSTRICTION; EXPRESSION; CLONING; CELLS	Objectives The goal was to identify alpha-1-adrenergic receptor (AR) subtypes in human coronary arteries. Background The alpha 1-ARs regulate human coronary blood flow. The alpha 1-ARs exist as 3 molecular subtypes, alpha 1A, alpha 1B,and alpha 1D, and the alpha 1D subtype mediates coronary vasoconstriction in the mouse. However, the alpha 1A is thought to be the only subtype in human coronary arteries. Methods We obtained human epicardial coronary arteries and left ventricular (LV) myocardium from 19 transplant recipients and 6 unused donors (age 19 to 70 years; 68% male; 32% with coronary artery disease). We cultured coronary rings and human coronary smooth muscle cells. We assayed alpha 1-and alpha-AR subtype messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and subtype proteins by radioligand binding and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation. Results The alpha 1D subtype was 85% of total coronary alpha 1-AR mRNA and 75% of total alpha 1-AR protein, and alpha 1D stimulation activated ERK. In contrast, the alpha 1D was low in LV myocardium. Total coronary alpha 1-AR levels were one-third of beta-ARs, which were 99% the beta 2 subtype. Conclusions The alpha 1D subtype is predominant and functional in human epicardial coronary arteries, whereas the alpha 1A and alpha 1B are present at very low levels. This distribution is similar to the mouse, where myocardial alpha 1A-and alpha 1B-ARs mediate beneficial functional responses and coronary alpha 1Ds mediate vasoconstriction. Thus, alpha 1D-selective antagonists might mediate coronary vasodilation, without the negative cardiac effects of nonselective alpha 1-AR antagonists in current use. Furthermore, it could be possible to selectively activate beneficial myocardial alpha 1A-and/or alpha 1B-AR signaling without causing coronary vasoconstriction.

A plethora of morphological, cytological and functional studies describes hemispheric asymmetry in auditory and language areas. However, no study has reported cortical lateralization in the healthy human brain in vivo on the level of neurotransmitter receptors and in relation to functional organization so far. In this study, we assessed the distribution of the main inhibitory serotonergic receptor (the 5-HT1A receptor) and analyzed its regional binding with regard to hemisphere, sex and plasma levels of sex steroid hormones (testosterone, estradiol, progesterone). We quantified the 5-HT1A receptor binding potential by positron emission tomography (PET) using the highly selective and specific radioligand [carbonyl-C-11] WAY-100635 and measured hormone levels in thirty-four (16 females, 18 males) healthy right- handed subjects. The obtained data were analyzed in an automated region of interest (ROI) based approach investigating 14 auditory, language and limbic areas. We found significantly higher 5-HT1A receptor binding in the superior and middle frontal gyri of the right hemisphere, the triangular and orbital parts of the inferior frontal gyrus, the supramarginal gyrus, the superior gyrus of the temporal pole and the middle temporal gyrus. Regions of the primary and secondary auditory cortex (Heschl's gyrus and superior temporal gyrus) and the Rolandic operculum displayed significantly higher receptor binding in the left hemisphere. 5-HT1A receptor binding was 1.8-2.9% higher in right frontal ROIs and 2-3.6% higher in left primary and secondary auditory regions. There was no hemispheric difference in 5-HT1A receptor binding in the hippocampus, amygdala, and insula. Post-hoc testing suggested that lateralization of 5-HT1A receptor binding differed between the sexes in the triangular part of the inferior frontal gyrus. For the first time, this PET study shows lateralization of the main inhibitory receptor of the serotonergic system in functionally asymmetric organized regions of the healthy human brain in vivo.

Use of a Novel Arg-Gly-Asp Radioligand, <SUP>18</SUP>F-AH111585, to Determine Changes in Tumor Vascularity After Antitumor Therapy	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						RGD peptide; PET; integrin alpha(v)beta(3); integrin alpha(v)beta(5); tumor vasculature; molecular imaging	ALPHA-V INTEGRINS; BREAST-CANCER; ALPHA(V)BETA(3) EXPRESSION; RGD; ANGIOGENESIS; INHIBITOR; GROWTH; AZD2171; BIODISTRIBUTION; TISSUES	Despite the recent development of various radiolabeled Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptides for imaging the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin receptor, relatively little attention has been focused on the ability of these radiotracers. to monitor changes in tumor vascularity after antitumor therapies. This study describes the favorable in vivo kinetics and tumor-targeting properties of F-18-AH111585, a novel F-18-RGD peptide, and its ability to monitor tumor vascularity noninvasively. Methods: Mice bearing Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) tumors or Calu-6 non-small cell lung tumor xenografts were used for in vivo biodistribution and small-animal PET imaging studies. In addition, some animals were treated with either low-dose paclitaxel or the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor ZD4190. Tumor uptake of F-18-AH111585 and microvessel density were then assessed. Results: Biodistribution of F-18-AH111585 demonstrated rapid clearance from the blood and key background organs and good tumor accumulation, with 1.5 percentage injected dose per gram (%ID/g) present at 2 h after injection in LLC tumors. Small-animal PET imaging of Calu-6 tumors allowed visualization of tumors above background tissue, with mean baseline uptake of 2.2 %ID/g. Paclitaxel therapy reduced the microvessel density in LLC tumor-bearing mice and resulted in significantly reduced F-18-AH111585 tumor uptake (P < 0.05). ZD4190 therapy resulted in a significant (31.8%) decrease in F-18-AH111585 uptake in Calu-6 tumors, compared with the vehicle control-treated Calu-6 tumors, which had a 26.9% increase in F-18-AH111585 uptake over the same period (P < 0.01). Conclusion: F-18-AH111585 is a promising F-18-labeled RGD tracer that offers a new approach to noninvasively image tumor vasculature. This tracer may reveal important information in the assessment of the impact of antitumor therapies, in particular those that predominantly target tumor blood vessels.

In this study we characterized adenosine receptors in human colon cancer tissues and in colon cancer cell lines Caco2, DLDI, HT29. mRNA of all adenosine subtypes was detected in cancer tissues and cell lines. At a protein levels low amount of A(1), A(2A), and A(2B) receptors were detected, whilst the A(3) was the most abundant subtype in both cancer tissues and cells, with a pharmacological profile typical of the A(3) subtype. All the receptors were coupled to stimulation/inhibition of adenylyl-cyclase in cancer cells, with the exception of A(1) subtype. Adenosine increased cell proliferation with an EC50 of 3-12 mu M in cancer cells. This effect was not essentially reduced by adenosine receptor antagonists. However dypiridamol, an adenosine transport inhibitor, increased the stimulatory effect induced by adenosine, suggesting an action at the cell surface. Addition of adenosine deaminase makes the A(3) agonist 2-chloro-N6-(3-iodobenzyl)-N-methyl-5'-carbamoyladenosine (CI-IB-MECA) able to stimulate cell proliferation with an EC50 of 0.5-0.9 nM in cancer cells, suggesting a tonic proliferative effect induced by endogenous adenosine. This effect was antagonized by 5-N-(4-methoxyphenyl-carbamoyl)amino-8-propyl-2(2furyl)-pyrazolo-[4,3e]-1,2,4-triazolo [1,5-c] pyrimidine (MRE 3008F20) 10 nM. CI-IB-MECA-stimulated cell proliferation involved extracellular-signal-regulated-kinases (ERK1/2) pathway, as demonstrated by reduction of proliferation with 1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis-[2-amino-phenylthio]-butadiene (U0126) and by ERK1/2 phosphorylation. In conclusion this study indicates for the first time that in colon cancer cell lines endogenous adenosine, through the interaction with A(3) receptors, mediates a tonic proliferative effect.

BPy-RGD conjugate was successfully synthesized by coupling of 5-carboxylate-2,2'-bipyridine and c(RGDyK) peptide through EDC/SNHS in aqueous solution and was characterized by MADLI-TOF-MS (m/z = 802.72, C38H48N11O9). Tc-99m(CO)(3)-BPy-RGD was prepared by exchange reaction between [Tc-99m(H2O)(3)(CO)(3)](+) and BPy-RGD. Final product was purified by HPLC and tested for octanol/water partition coefficient. Cell-binding assays of BPy-RGD and unmodified c(RGDyK) were tested in MDA-MB-435 cells (I-125-echistatin as radioligand). Preliminary biodistribution of the Tc-99m(I)-labeled radiotracer in orthotopic MDA-MB-435 breast tumor xenograft model was also evaluated. The BPy-RGD conjugate had good integrin-binding affinity (50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) = 92.51 +/- 22.69 nM), slightly lower than unmodified c(RGDyK) (IC50 = 59.07 +/- 11.03 nM). The hydrophilic radiotracer also had receptor-mediated activity accumulation in MDA-MB-435 tumor (1.45 +/- 0.25 percentage of injected dose per gram (%ID/g) at 1.5 h postinjection (p.i.)), which is known to be integrin positive. After blocking with c(RGDyK), the tumor uptake was reduced from 0.71 +/- 0.01% ID/g to 0.33 +/- 0.18% ID/g at 4 h p.i. Tc-99m(I) tricarbonyl complex of cyclic RGD peptide is a promising strategy for integrin targeting. Further modification of the bipyridine-conjugated RGD peptide by using more potent RGD peptides and fine tuning of the tether group between the RGD moiety and Tc-99m(CO)(3)(+) core to improve the tumor targeting efficacy and in vivo kinetic profiles is currently in progress.

The peptidic urotensin-II receptor ligand GSK248451 possesses less intrinsic activity than the low-efficacy partial agonists SB-710411 and urantide in native mammalian tissues and recombinant cell systems	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						urotensin-II; UT receptor; G-protein-coupled receptor; vasoconstriction; radioligand binding; BacMam; urantide; GSK248451; SB-710411; operational model	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; VASCULAR-TONE; IN-VITRO; ANTAGONIST; RAT; VASOCONSTRICTOR; EXPRESSION; HEART; IDENTIFICATION	1 Several peptidic urotensin-II (UT) receptor antagonists exert 'paradoxical' agonist activity in recombinant cell- and tissue-based bioassay systems, likely the result of differential urotensin-II receptor (UT receptor) signal transduction/coupling efficiency between assays. The present study has examined this phenomenon in mammalian arteries and recombinant UT-HEK (human embryonic kidney) cells. 2 BacMam-mediated recombinant UT receptor upregulation in HEK cells augmented agonist activity for all four peptidic UT ligands studied. The nominal rank order of relative intrinsic efficacy was U-II > urantide ([Pen(5)-DTrp(7)-Orn(8)]hU-II4-11) > SB-710411 (Cpa-c[DCys-Pal-DTrp-Lys-Val-Cys]-Cpa-amide) >> GSK248451 (Cin-c[DCys-Pal-DTrp-Orn-Val-Cys]-His-amide) (the relative coupling efficiency of recombinant HEK cells was cat > human >> rat UT receptor). 3 The present study further demonstrated that the use of high signal transduction/coupling efficiency isolated blood vessel assays (primate > cat arteries) is required in order to characterize UT receptor antagonism thoroughly. This cannot be attained simply by using the rat isolated aorta, an artery with low signal transduction/coupling efficiency in which low-efficacy agonists appear to function as antagonists. 4 In contrast to the 'low-efficacy agonists' urantide and SB-710411, GSK248451 functioned as a potent UT receptor antagonist in all native isolated tissues studied (UT receptor selectivity was confirmed in the rat aorta). Further, GSK248451 exhibited an extremely low level of relative intrinsic activity in recombinant HEK cells (4-5-fold less than seen with urantide). Since GSK248451 (1 mg kg(-1), i.v.) blocked the systemic pressor actions of exogenous U-II in the anaesthetized cat, it represents a suitable peptidic tool antagonist for delineating the role of U-II in the aetiology of mammalian cardiometabolic diseases.

However, the mechanisms by which pregabalin exerts its therapeutic effects are not yet completely understood. In vitro studies have shown that pregabalin binds with high affinity to the alpha(2)-delta (alpha(2)-delta) subunits (Type 1 and 2) of voltage-gated calcium channels. To assess whether alpha(2)-delta Type 1 is the major central nervous system (CNS) binding protein for pregabalin in vivo, a mutant mouse with an arginine-to-alanine mutation at amino acid 217 of the alpha(2)-delta Type 1 protein (R217A mutation) was generated. Previous site-directed mutagenesis studies revealed that the R217A mutation dramatically reduces alpha(2)-delta 1 binding to pregabalin in vitro. In this autoradiographic analysis of R217A mice, we show that the mutation to alpha(2)-delta Type 1 substantially reduces specific pregabalin binding in CNS regions that are known to preferentially express the alpha(2)-delta Type 1 protein, notably the neocortex, hippocampus, basolateral amygdala and spinal cord. In mutant mice, pregabalin binding was robust throughout regions where the alpha(2)-delta Type 2 subunit mRNA is abundant, such as cerebellum. These findings, in conjunction with prior in vitro binding data, provide evidence that the alpha(2)-delta Type 1 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels is the major binding protein for pregabalin in CNS. Moreover, the distinct localization of alpha(2)-delta Type 1 and mutation-resistant binding (assumed to be alpha(2)-delta Type 2) in brain areas subserving different functions suggests that identification of subunit-specific ligands could further enhance pharmacologic specificity.

The non-asthmatic lung possessed 3.2-fold more P-adrenergic receptors than bronchi (496 +/- 19.4 vs. 155.1 +/- 19.6 fmol/mg protein; P < 0.01) and 6.2-fold higher than in the trachea (79.8 +/- 12.6 fmol/mg protein; P < 0.001) (assessed by radioligand binding assays using (-)-[I-125]- iodocyanopindolol, ICYP) and in all tissues a greater proportion of the beta(2)- than the beta(1)-subtype (75-80%). The receptor density (B-max) in lung parenchyma and bronchial membranes was 33 and 42%, respectively, lower (P < 0.001) in RAO than in control animals, attributable to a decrease in the beta(2)-subtype. This receptor down-regulation was accompanied with an attenuated coupling efficiency of the receptor to the stimulatory G(S)-protein (P < 0.05 vs. control). Concomitantly, activation of adenylate cyclase evoked by isoproterenol was significantly reduced in lung and bronchial membranes of animals with RAO, whereas effects of 10 mu M GTP, 10 mM NaF, 10 mu M forskolin and 10 mM Mn2+ were not altered. There was no difference in beta-adrenergic receptor density, G(S)-protein or adenylate cyclase coupling in the trachea between asthmatic and control animals. In conclusion, in stable asthma the pulmonary P-adrenergic receptor-G(S)-protein-adenylate cyclase system is impaired, thus the pathologic process involves all signaling components, and due to its close similarity, this animal model seems to serve as a suitable model, at least partly, of chronic asthmatic patients.

The unique effects of clozapine on cannabis use could, therefore, be due to an as yet unidentified interaction between clozapine and the endogenous cannabinoid system. To address this hypothesis, we used in situ radioligand binding and quantitative autoradiography with the selective cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonist, (-)-cis-3-[2-hydroxy-4-(1,1-dimethylheptyl)phenyl]-trans-4-(3-hydroxypropyl)cyclohexanol (side chain-2,3,4(N)-H-3) ([H-3]CP 55940) to measure the density of the CB1 receptor in frontal cortex, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens and striatum from rats treated with a variety of antipsychotic drugs. Clozapine significantly decreased [ 3H] CP 55940 binding in the nucleus accumbens compared with vehicle after 1 (35.0 +/- 14.0 vs. 71.2 +/- 8.5 fmol/mg estimated tissue equivalent (ete); P=0.03) and 3 months (42.3 +/- 4.0 vs. 71.1 +/- 16.3 fmol/mg ete; P < 0.04) of treatment, an effect not observed with haloperidol, chlorpromazine or olanzapine. In rats treated with clozapine for 3 months and then left for 1 month without treatment, [3H] CP 55940 binding was not different in the nucleus accumbens (100.5 +/- 22.2 vs. 100.9 +/- 25.4 fmol/mg ete; P > 0.10). By contrast, there were significant increases in accumbal [H-3] CP 55940 binding in rats treated with haloperidol (136.5 14.2 fmol/mg ete; P < 0.05), chlorpromazine (137.4 +/- 12.7 fmol/mg ete; P < 0.05) and olanzapine (144.7 +/- 10.1 fmol/mg ete; P < 0.01). These data indicate that in the nucleus accumbens clozapine differs from other antipsychotic drugs in its effects on [3H] CP 55940 binding. If these results can be extrapolated into humans, then this effect of clozapine on the CB1 receptor may be a mechanism that makes it uniquely effective in schizophrenia and comorbid cannabis use.

We recently identified Ser(1115) in IIIS5-S6 linker of alpha(1C) subunit as a critical determinant of the action of 1,4-dihydropyridine agonists. In this study, we applied alanine-scanning mutational analysis in IIIS5-S6 linker of rat brain alpha(1C) subunit (rbCII) to illustrate the role of pore-forming IIIS5-S6 linker in the action of Ca2+ channel modulators. Ca2+ channel currents through wild-type (rbCII) or mutated alpha(1C) subunits, transiently expressed in BHK6 cells with beta(1a) and alpha(2)/delta subunits, were analyzed. The replacement of Phe(1112) by Ala (F1112A) significantly impaired the sensitivity to Ca2+ channel agonists (S)-(-)-Bay k 8644 and FPL-64176, and modestly to 1,4-dihydropyridine (DHP) antagonists. The low sensitivity of F1112A and S1115A to DHP antagonists was consistent with the reduced binding affinity for [H-3](+)PN200-110. The replacement of Phe(1112) by Tyr, but not by Ala, restored the long openings produced by FPL-64176, thus indicating the critical role of aromatic ring of Phe(1112) in the Ca2+ channel agonist action. Interestingly, double-mutant Ca2+ channel (F1112A/S1115A) failed to discriminate between Ca2+ channel agonist (S)-(-)-1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-5-nitro-4-(2-[trifluoromethyl] phenyl)-3-pyridine carboxylic acid methyl ester (Bay k 8644) and antagonist (R)-(+)-Bay k 8644 and was blocked by the two enantiomers in an identical manner. These results indicate that both Phe(1112) and Ser(1115) in linker IIIS5-S6 are required for the action of Ca2+ channel agonists. A model of the DHP receptor is proposed to visualize possible interactions of Phe(1112), Ser(1115), and other DHP-sensing residues with a typical DHP ligand nifedipine.

In this study we aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of using ultra-high-resolution SPET to measure the occupancy of dopamine D-2 receptors by a competing drug, using the dopamine D-2 receptor-specific radioligand iodine-123 5-iodo-7-N-[(1-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinyl) methyl] carboxamido-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran ([I-123]IBF). Fourteen normal male mice (CD-1) were jugular vein-cannulated and a bolus infusion protocol was used to deliver 360 MBq [I-123]IBF into the mouse (bolus-to-infusion ratio 1.8:1). The mice were scanned using an ultra-high-resolution triple-headed SPET system equipped with pinhole collimators. After sustained equilibrium had been achieved, varying doses of raclopride, a potent dopamine D-2 receptor antagonist, were injected through the tail vein and the tracer was allowed to regain equilibrium. A simple equilibrium ratio of striatum to cerebellum provided a measure of D2 receptor binding both before and after injection of raclopride. Following raclopride administration, the system returned to equilibrium with lower specific binding in the striatum, while the counts in the cerebellum were unaffected. Receptor occupancy was 5.2%+/-2.9% (control), 52.1%+/-11.1% (0.3 mg/kg), 79.3%+/-4.8% (1.0 mg/kg), and 94.7%+/-2.2% (3.0 mg/kg), which gave an ED50=0.26+/-0.03 mg/kg using a single receptor site saturation model. This study has demonstrated clearly that ultra-high-resolution SPET of small animals is capable of measuring displacement and occupancy of dopamine D-2 receptors, by competing ligands.

However, effects of moderate MDMA use on serotonin neurons have not been studied, and sex differences and the longterm effects of MDMA use on serotonin neurons have not been identified. We investigated the effects of moderate and heavy MDMA use, sex differences, and long-term effects of MDMA use on serotonin neurons in different brain regions. Methods By means of flyers posted in "rave" venues in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, we recruited 15 moderate MDMA users, 23 heavy MDMA users, 16 ex-MDMA users who had stopped using MDMA for more than 1 year, and 15 controls who claimed never to have used MDMA. We studied the effects of MDMA on brain serotonin neurons using (123)iodine-2 beta -carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-iodophenyl) tropane ([I-123][beta -CIT)-a radioligand that binds with high affinity to serotonin transporters. Density of binding (expressed as a ratio of region-of-interest binding over binding in the cerebellum) was calculated by single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPELT). Findings We saw significant effects of group and group by sex (p=0.041 and p=0.022, respectively) on overall [I-123])beta -CIT binding ratios. In heavy MDMA users, significant decreases in overall binding ratios were seen in women (p<0.01) but not men (p=0.587). In female ex-MDMA users, overall densities of serotonin transporters were significantly higher than in heavy MDMA users (p=0.004), but not higher than in controls (p=0.524). Interpretation Our results indicate that heavy use of MDMA is associated with neurotoxic effects on serotonin neurons, that women might be more susceptible than men, and that MDMA-induced neurotoxic changes in several brain regions of female ex-MDMA users are reversible.

In competition binding studies AP91-131 was about 3-fold less potent than the natural agonist alpha -melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha -MSH) in displacing the radioligand [I-125]-[Nle(4), D-Phe(7)]-alpha -MSH (K-i 6.5 +/-0.8 nmol/l). alpha -MSH-induced tyrosinase activation and melanin production were completely inhibited by a 100-fold higher concentration of AP(91-131); the IC50 values for AP(91-131) in the two assay systems were 91 +/- 22 nM and 95 +/- 15 nM respectively. Basal melanin production and adenylate cyclase activity in the absence of agonist were decreased by AP(91-131) with IC50 values of 9.6 +/-1.8 nM and 5.0 +/-2.4 nM, respectively. This indicates inverse agonist activity of AP(91-131) Similar to that of native AR The presence of 10 nM melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) slightly potentiated the inhibitory activity of AP91-131 in the adenylate cyclase and melanin assays. On the other hand, AP91-131 inhibited cell growth similar to alpha -MSH (IC50 11.0 +/-2.1 nM; maximal inhibition 1.8-fold higher than that of alpha -MSH). Furthermore, MC1-R was down-regulated by AP91-131 with about the same potency and time-course as with alpha -MSH. These results demonstrate that AP(91-131) displays both agonist and antagonist activities at the MC1-R and hence that it is the cysteine-rich region of agouti protein which inhibits and mimics the different alpha -MSH functions, most likely by simultaneous modulation of different intracellular signalling pathways.

In recent in vivo studies using positron emission tomography (PET) our group demonstrated that: the myocardial beta adrenoceptor (PAR) density is reduced in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) and idiopathic right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia (RVO-VT) associated with an increased presynaptic catecholamine washout. It was hypothesised that the reduction of myocardial PAR density is secondary to an increase of local catecholamines in the myocardium resulting from the presynaptic dysfunction since circulating plasma catecholamines were demonstrated to be unchanged in these conditions. To further prove this hypothesis of an organ-limited adrenergic nervous dysfunction of the heart, this study aimed to investigate PAR density in another thoracic organ, the lung. Methods. Pulmonary and myocardial PAR density was measured in 7 ARVC patients, 8 RVO-VT patients and in a group of healthy controls (n = 13) using the non-selective beta -blocker [C-11]-CGP 12177 and PET. Results. Pulmonary PAR density was similar in controls (12.4 +/- 1.7 pmol/g tissue), ARVC (11.6 +/- 1.7 pmol/g tissue, p = ns) and RVO-VT (12.8 +/- 2.0 pmol/g tissue, p = ns), whereas myocardial PAR density was significantly reduced in ARVC (6.3 +/- 1.1 pmol/g tissue, p = 0.006) and RVO-VT (6.8 +/- 1.2 pmol/g tissue, p=0.02) as compared to controls (8.8+/-1.5 pmol/g tissue). Conclusion. The unchanged pulmonary PAR density in the presence of a previously described significant reduction in myocardial PAR density in the same patient principally supports our pathophysiological hypothesis that the myocardial PAR density may be reduced in ARVC and RVO-VT because of an increase in local synaptic catecholamine levels due to an organ-limited presynaptic adrenergic dysfunction of the heart. Since in the present study only pulmonary PAR density was measured, future functional studies excluding pulmonary PAR desensitisation are required to finally prove the unchanged pulmonary sympathetic innervation in ARVC and RVO-VT.

As compared with the FPA isoform, the FPB isoform lacks the last 46 amino acids of the carboxyl terminus and, therefore, represents a truncated version of the FPA. We recently found (Pierce, K. L,, Fujino, H., Srinivasan, D., and Began, J. W. (1999) J, Biol; Chem. 274, 35944-35949) that stimulation of both isoforms with PGF(2 alpha) leads to activation of a Rho signaling pathway, resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of p125 focal adhesion kinase, formation of actin stress fibers, and cell rounding, Although the activation of Rho and subsequent cell rounding occur at a similar rate for both isoforms, we now report that following the removal of PGF(2 alpha) the reversal of cell rounding is much slower for cells expressing the FPB isoform as compared with the FPA isoform, Thus, in HEK-293 cells that stably express the FPA isoform, the reversal of cell rounding appears to be complete after 1 h, whereas for FPB-expressing cells there is essentially no reversal even after 2 h, Similarly, the disappearance of stress fibers and dephosphorylation of p125 focal adhesion kinase following removal of agonist are much slower in FPB-expressing cells than in FPA-expressing cells. The mechanism of this differential reversal appears to involve a difference in receptor resensitization following the removal of agonist, Based upon whole cell radioligand binding, agonist-induced stimulation of inositol phosphate formation, and mobilization. of intracellular Ca2+, the FPB isoform resensitizes more slowly than the FPA isoform, These findings suggest that the carboxyl terminus of the FPA is critical for resensitization and that the slower resensitization of the FPA isoform leads to prolonged signaling. This differential signaling distinguishes the FPA and FPB receptor isoforms and could be important toward understanding the physiological actions of PGF(2 alpha).

In the presence of 10 mu M agmatine, the prostaglandin E-2(PGE(2))-induced EP3-receptor-mediated inhibition of [H-3]-noradrenaline release was not modified, whereas the alpha(2D)-adrenoceptor-mediated inhibition of [H-3]-noradrenaline release induced by noradrenaline, moxonidine or clonidine was more pronounced than in the absence of agmatine. However, 1 mM agmatine antagonized the moxonidine-induced inhibition of [H-3]-noradrenaline release. 3 Agmatine concentration-dependently inhibited the binding of [H-3]-clonidine and [H-3]-rauwolscine to rat brain cortex membranes (K-i values 6 mu M and 12 mu M, respectively). In addition, 30 and 100 mu M agmatine increased the rate of association and decreased the rate of dissociation of [H-3]-clonidine resulting in an increased affinity of the radioligand for the alpha(2D)-adrenoceptors. 4 [C-14]-agmatine labelled specific binding sites on rat brain cortex membranes. In competition experiments. [C-14]-agmatine was inhibited from binding to its specific recognition sites by unlabelled agmatine, but not by rauwolscine and moxonidine. 5 In conclusion, the present data indicate that agmatine both acts as an antagonist at the ligand recognition site of the alpha(2D)-adrenoceptor and enhances the effects of alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonists probably by binding to an allosteric binding site of the alpha(2D)-adrenoceptor which seems to be labelled by [C-14]-agmatine.

As their pharmacology is not well characterized, we examined in vitro pharmacology and structure-activity relationships of 22 substituted fentanyls with modifications of the fentanyl propyl group, and conducted in silico receptor/ligand modeling. Affinities for mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors (MOR, KOR, and DOR, respectively) heterologously expressed in mammalian cells were assessed in agonist radioligand binding assays. At MOR, furanyl fentanyl had higher affinity than fentanyl, while acryl, isobutyryl and cyclopropyl fentanyls had similar affinities. Comparing affinities, thiophene and methoxyacetyl fentanyls had highest selectivity for MOR (2520- and 2730-fold compared to KOR and DOR, respectively). Functional activities were assessed using [S-35]GTP gamma S binding assays. At MOR, furanyl fentanyl had higher potency and 11 substituted fentanyls had similar high potencies compared to fentanyl. Eight compounds were full agonists of MOR and twelve compounds were partial agonists, with efficacies from 8.8% (phenyl fentanyl) to 60.2% (butyryl fentanyl). All efficacious compounds had selective functional potency for MOR. The predicted binding poses of flexible fentanyl and rigid morphine against MOR show partially overlapping binding pockets, with fentanyl maintaining additional interaction with the transmembrane (TM) 2 helix. Subsequent molecular dynamics simulations revealed a predominant fentanyl binding pose involving various TM interactions. The piperidine nitrogen of substituted fentanyls establishes a salt-bridge with the conserved D-147(3.32) residue and the propanamide carbonyl group establishes a hydrogen bond with the indole side-chain (-NH) of W-3187.35. The simulation suggests the N-linked phenethyl group may regulate the rotameric switch of W-293(6.48). The predicted binding pose, in conjunction with in vitro binding affinity, clarified the molecular basis of the binding/selectivity profile of furanyl fentanyl and other derivatives at the sequence level. In summary, substituted fentanyls with high MOR potencies, selectivities, and efficacies are likely to have abuse and overdose potential. The work presented here is a prototype to investigate fentanyl derivatives and their abuse potential.

The effects of AT1 antagonists are not limited to cardiovascular diseases. AT1 receptor blockers may be used as potential anti-cancer agents - due to the inhibition of cell proliferation stimulated by A-II. Therefore, AT1 receptors and the A-II biosynthesis mechanisms are targets for the development of new synthetic drugs and therapeutic treatment of various cardiovascular and other diseases. In this work, multi-scale molecular modeling approaches were performed and it is found that oxazolone and imidazolone derivatives reveal similar/better interaction energy profiles compared to the FDA approved sartan molecules at the binding site of the AT1 receptor. In silico-guided designed hit molecules were then synthesized and tested for their binding affinities to human AT1 receptor in radioligand binding studies, using [I-125-Sar(1)-Ile(8)] AngII. Among the compounds tested, 19d and 9j molecules bound to receptor in a dose response manner and with relatively high affinities. Next, cytotoxicity and wound healing assays were performed for these hit molecules. Since hit molecule 19d led to deceleration of cell motility in all three cell lines (NIH3T3, A549, and H358) tested in this study, this molecule is investigated in further tests. In two cell lines (HUVEC and MCF-7) tested, 19d induced G2/M cell cycle arrest in a concentration dependent manner. Adherent cells detached from the plates and underwent cell death possibly due to apoptosis at 19d concentrations that induced cell cycle arrest. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

We investigated the biodistribution and biokinetics of [C-11]choline and provide estimates of radiation doses in humans. The distribution of [C-11]choline was evaluated ex vivo in healthy rats (n=9) by measuring the radioactivity of excised organs, and in vivo in tumour-bearing rats (n=4) by PET. In addition to estimates of human radiation doses extrapolated from rat data, more accurate human radiation doses were calculated on the basis of PET imaging of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (n=6) primarily participating in a synovitis imaging project with [C-11]choline. Dynamic data were acquired from the thorax and abdomen after injection of 423 +/- 11 MBq (mean +/- SD) of tracer. Following PET imaging, the radioactivity in voided urine was measured. The experimental human data were used for residence time estimations. Radiation doses were calculated with OLINDA/EXM. In rats, the radioactivity distributed mainly to the kidneys, lungs, liver and adrenal gland. The effective dose in a human adult of about 70 kg was 0.0044 mSv/MBq, which is equivalent to 2.0 mSv from 460 MBq of [C-11]choline PET. The highest absorbed doses in humans were 0.021 mGy/MBq in the kidneys, 0.020 mGy/MBq in the liver and 0.029 mGy/MBq in the pancreas. Only 2.0% of injected radioactivity was excreted in the urine during the 1.5 h after injection. The absorbed radiation doses after administration of 460 MBq of [C-11]choline were low. Except for the pancreas, biodistribution in the rat was in accordance with that in humans, but rat data may underestimate the effective dose, suggesting that clinical measurements are needed for a more detailed estimation. The observed effective doses suggest the feasibility of [C-11]choline PET for human studies.

For each dataset, three methods of alignment were employed: a receptor-docked alignment derived from the structure-based docking algorithm GOLD, another from the ligand-based alignment algorithm FlexS, and a rigid realignment of the poses from the receptor-docked alignment. The receptor-docked alignment produced statistically superior results compared to either the FlexS alignment or the realignment in both datasets. The [I-125]IOXY set (Model 1) and [H-3]diprenorphine set (Model 2) gave q(2) values of 0.592 and 0.620, respectively, using the receptor-docked alignment, and both models produced similar CoMFA contour maps that reflected the stereoelectronic features of the receptor model from which they were derived. Each model gave significantly predictive CoMFA statistics (Model 1 PSET r(2) = 0.833; Model 2 PSET r(2) = 0.813). Based on the CoMFA contour maps, a binding mode was proposed for amine-containing Salvinorin A analogs that provides a rationale for the observation that the beta-epimers (R-configuration) of protonated amines at the C-2 position have a higher affinity than the corresponding alpha-epimers (S-configuration).

Imaging serotonergic transmission with [<SUP>11</SUP>C]DASB-PET in depressed and non-depressed patients infected with HIV	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						NeuroAIDS; Serotonin; 5-HTT; Positron emissions tomography; Molecular imaging	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; STRUCTURED CLINICAL INTERVIEW; ACUTE-TRYPTOPHAN-DEPLETION; PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; REFERENCE TISSUE MODEL; TRANSPORTER BINDING; HUMAN BRAIN; PROMOTER REGION; HEALTHY HUMANS; TEST-RETEST	Introduction Site-selective imaging can provide significant insight into the mechanism of HIV-associated neurological disease. The goal of this study was to evaluate the involvement of serotonergic transmission in HIV-associated depression using [C-11]DASB, a serotonin transporter (5-HTT)-specific radiopharmaceutical for positron emission tomography (PET) Methods Nine depressed HIV+ subjects (HIV-D), 9 non-depressed HIV+ subjects (HIV-ND) and 7 healthy controls (HC) underwent and MRI scan and a [C-11]DASB-PET scan The outcome measure was 5-HT binding potential normalized to non-displaceable tissue radioligand (BPND) RESULTS HIV-ND subjects had lower mean regional 5-HTT BPND estimates across regions compared to HC, while HIV-D subjects demonstrated higher mean regional binding values than HIV-ND subjects in most regions. Prior to correction for the false discovery rate, HIV-ND had significantly lower BPND values compared to HC subjects in two regions (insula and anterior cingulate) and all HIV+ subjects compared to HC (P < 0.0045) Despite a significant difference in the duration of illness between the HIV-D and HIV-ND groups, there was no definite correlation between the duration of illness and BPND. Conclusion: Lower [C-11]DASB binding in HIV+ patients compared to HC any reflect serotonergic neuronal loss as a component of genearalized HIV-associated neurodegeneration. Higher mean regional BPND values in HIV-D compared to HIV-ND subjects could reflect increased density of 5-HTT, leading to increased clearance of serotinin from the synapse, which could account, in part, for symptoms of depression. The lack of correlation between duration of illness and binding argues against these findings being the result of differential neurodegeneration only. Our findings suggest a possible role of dysregulated serotonergic transmission in HIV-associated depression. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

In vivo effects of 3-iodocytisine: Pharmacological and genetic analysis of hypothermia and evaluation of chronic treatment on nicotinic binding sites	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors; Null mutant mice; 3-iodocytisine; Hypothermia; Epibatidine; alpha-Bungarotoxin	ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR SUBUNIT; HALOGENATED CYTISINE DERIVATIVES; ALPHA-BUNGAROTOXIN BINDING; MOUSE-BRAIN; AUTORADIOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS; CHOLINERGIC RECEPTORS; MICE LACKING; RAT-BRAIN; UP-REGULATION; BETA-2	Several cytisine derivatives have been developed in the search for more selective drugs at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR). Binding experiments in transfected cell lines showed that the iodination of cytisine in the position 3 of the pyridone ring increased potency at alpha 7-nAChR and to a lesser extent at the alpha 4 beta 2 subtypes, both of which are widely expressed in the brain. However, no in vivo studies have been published on this compound. Inhibition curves presented here using wild type, beta 2, and beta 4-null mutant mice confirm that 3-IC binds to alpha 4 beta 2*, alpha 7* and alpha 3 beta 4* receptors with higher affinity than cytisine (asterisk indicates the receptor may contain additional subunits, Lukas et al., 1999). Intraperitoneal injection of 3-iodocytisine (3-IC) induced considerable dose-dependent hypothermia in DBA/2J and C57BL/6J mice. This response was blocked by mecamylamine and partially inhibited by hexamethonium. M-null mice displayed significantly less 3-IC-induced hypothermia than wild-type mice, beta 2-null mice were somewhat less affected than wild types, while responses of alpha 7*-null mice were similar to wild types. Mice treated chronically with 3-IC display a marked increase in alpha 7* and alpha 4 beta 2* binding sites determined by radioligand binding in membrane preparations from cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Quantitative autoradiographic analysis of 28 brain regions of mice treated with 3-IC was consistent with the membrane binding, detecting an increase of cytisine-sensitive [I-125]epibatidine binding sites, while cytisine-resistant [I-125]epibatidine sites were unchanged. [I-125]alpha-Bungarotoxin binding sites also exhibited up-regulation. These results give a first evaluation of in vivo consequences of 3-IC as a potent agonist with marked effects on mice.

Substituted 2-phenyl imidazopyridine-3-acetamides with high affinity and selectivity for PBRs have been prepared that are suitable for radiolabelling with a number of positron emission tomography and single-photon emission computed tomography ( SPECT) isotopes. In this investigation, the newly developed high-affinity PBR ligand 6-chloro-2-(4'-iodophenyl)-3-(N,N-diethyl)imidazo[ 1,2-a] pyridine-3-acetamide, or CLINDE, was radiolabelled with I-123 and its biodistribution in the central nervous system (CNS) of rats with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) evaluated. Methods: EAE was induced in male Lewis rats by injection of an emulsion of myelin basic protein and incomplete Freund's adjuvant containing Mycobacterium butyricum. Biodistribution studies with I-123-CLINDE were undertaken on EAE rats exhibiting different clinical disease severity and compared with results in controls. Disease severity was confirmed by histopathology in the spinal cord of rats. The relationship between inflammatory lesions and PBR ligand binding was investigated using ex vivo autoradiography and immunohistochemistry on rats with various clinical scores. Results: I-123-CLINDE uptake was enhanced in the CNS of all rats exhibiting EAE when compared to controls. Binding reflected the ascending nature of EAE inflammation, with lumbar/sacral cord > thoracic cord > cervical cord > medulla. The amount of ligand binding also reflected the clinical severity of disease. Ex vivo autoradiography and immunohistochemistry revealed a good spatial correspondence between radioligand signal and foci of inflammation and in particular ED-1(+) cells representing macrophages and microglia. Conclusion: These results demonstrate the ability of I-123-CLINDE to measure in vivo inflammatory events represented by increased density of PBRs and suggest that I-123-CLINDE warrants further investigation as a potential SPECT marker for imaging of CNS inflammation.

NR1-2a(c-Myc)/NR2A receptors when expressed in mammalian cells are not trafficked to the cell surface nor do they yield cell cytotoxicity post-transfection. NR1-2a(c-Myc) was, however, shown to assemble with NR2A subunits by immunoprecipitation and [H-3] MK801 radioligand binding assays. Immunoblots of cells co-transfected with wild-type NR1-2a/ NR2A subunits yielded two NR1-2a immunoreactive species with molecular masses of 115 and 226 kDa. Two-dimensional electrophoresis under non-reducing and reducing conditions revealed that the 226-kDa band contained disulfide-linked NR1-2a subunits. Only the 115-kDa NR1-2a species was detected for NR1-2a(c-Myc)/NR2A. The c-Myc epitope is inserted adjacent to cysteine 79 of the NR1-2a subunit; therefore, it is possible that the tag may prevent the formation of NR1 disulfide bridges. A series of cysteine --> alanine NR1-2a mutants was generated, and the NR1-2a mutants were co-expressed with NR2A or NR2B subunits in mammalian cells and characterized with respect to cell surface expression, cell cytotoxicity post-transfection, co-association by immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting following SDS-PAGE under both reducing and non-reducing conditions. When co-expressed with NR2A in mammalian cells, NR1-2a(C79A)/NR2A displayed similar properties to NR1-2a(c-Myc)/NR2A in that the 226-kDa NR1 immunoreactive species was not detectable, and trafficking to the cell surface was impaired compared with wild-type NR1/NR2 receptors. These results provide the first biochemical evidence for the formation of NR1-NR1 intersubunit disulfide-linked homodimers involving cysteine 79. They suggest that disulfide bridging and structural integrity within the NR1 N-terminal domain is requisite for cell surface N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor expression.

Through interactions with opioid receptors (ORs) on submucosal neurones, opioids suppress active ion transport evoked by transmural electrical stimulation (TES) in mucosa submucosa sheets from the porcine ileum. In this study, we examined the pharmacological characteristics of the previously described OR, which is sensitive to the delta(1)-OR antagonist 7-benzylidenenaltrexone and modulates neurogenic transepithelial ion transport in this tissue preparation. 2 Increases in short-circuit current (I-sc, a measure of active anion transport) evoked by TES in ileal mucosa-submucosa sheets were inhibited by opioid agonists possessing high selectivity for either delta- or mu-ORs including [D-Pen(2,5)] enkephalin (DPDPE), [D-Ala(2), Glu(4)]deltorphin II, and [D-Ala(2), N-Me-Phe(4), Gly(5)-ol] enkephalin (DAMGO). 3 As determined by the Schild analysis, the actions of these agonists were competitively inhibited by 7-benzylidenenaltrexone. The nonequilibrium mu-OR antagonist beta-funaltrexamine inhibited the actions of DAMGO only at a high concentration (1 muM) but did not alter DPDPE or deltorphin II action. At concentrations up to 10 muM, the nonequilibrium delta-OR antagonist naltrindole 5'-isothiocyanate did not alter the actions of delta- or mu-OR agonists. 4 Radioligand binding analyses of neuronal homogenates from the ileal submucosa revealed that the nonselective OR ligand [H-3] diprenorphine bound to two populations of specific binding sites. One of these sites possessed binding characteristics similar to the delta-OR. 5 In summary, neurogenic ion transport in the porcine intestine is modulated by an OR which shares pharmacological characteristics of both mu- and delta-ORs and may represent a novel receptor entity.

In a mutagenicity study, 5-I-A-85380 produced positive effects in one of five bacterial strains in the bacterial reverse mutation assay only with metabolic activation. The ED50 for 5-I-A-85380 to elicit tonic-clonic convulsions in mice, 7.1 mumol/kg, i.v., was five times that of nicotine (ED50 = 1.4 mumol/kg, i.v.). A 2-day acute toxicity study (0.03-150 nmol/kg, i.v.) and a 14-day chronic toxicity study (0.3-30 nmol/kg, s.c.) in mice revealed no evidence of gross pathology or histopathological changes. Biodistribution and dosimetry studies revealed that the urinary bladder wall and the thyroid gland were the critical organs with respect to radiation exposure. In unanesthetized rats, 5-I-A-85380 (5.2-174 nmol/kg, i.v.) and nicotine (20-400 nmol/kg, i.v.) produced similar increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and locomotor activity. Doses of 5-I-A-85380 that elevated blood pressure and heart rate by 10% ranged from 5-10 nmol/kg, i.v. The highest doses tested, which produced near maximal increases in blood pressure and heart rate, did not affect the PR, QRS, or QTc intervals of the electrocardiogram. Based on these preclinical data, initial SPECT imaging studies in humans (Fujita et al. [2002] Eur J Nucl Med 29:183-190) used a mass dose of 8.6 pmol/kg [I-123]5-1-A-8380, estimated to be 1/580th of the dose that elevates blood pressure and heart rate by 10%. Importantly, no clinical pharmacological effects were observed.

Different PSMA-analogues labeled with [Ga-68]gallium have been investigated, showing excellent imaging properties; however, only small amounts can be produced for each radiolabeling. Recently, a [F-18]fluoride labeled PSMA-inhibitor, [F-18]PSMA-1007, has been introduced, and it has ensured large-scale productions, overcoming this limitation of [Ga-68]PSMAs. In this study, PSMA-1007 has been labeled with low (A), medium (B) and high (C) starting activities of [F-18]fluoride, in order to verify if radiochemical yield, radiochemical purity and stability of [F-18]PSMA-1007 were affected. These parameters have been measured in sixty-five consecutive batches. In addition, the estimation of [F-18]PSMA-1007 production costs is provided. Results The radiochemical yield for low and medium activities of [F-18]fluoride was 52%, while for the high one it decreased to 40%. The radiochemical purity was 99% for all three activities. [F-18]PSMA-1007 did not show radiolysis up to 8 h after the end of synthesis, confirming that the radiopharmaceutical is stable and suitable to perform diagnostic studies in humans for a long period of time after the end of radiolabeling. Furthermore, radiochemical stability was demonstrated in fetal bovine serum at 4 degrees C and 37 degrees C for 120 '. Conclusions A starting activity of [F-18]fluoride of 90 GBq (B) seems to be the best option enabling a final amount of about of 50 GBq of [F-18]PSMA-1007, which is promising as it allows to: (a) perform a large number of scans, and/or (b) supply the radiopharmaceutical to any peripheral diagnostic centers in need.

Altanserin (ALT) and 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) act as 5-HT2AR antagonist and agonist, respectively. In the present study, we assessed the effects of ALT and DOI on motor and exploratory behaviors and on D2/3R binding in the rat brain with in vivo imaging methods. Methods: D2/3R binding was determined after systemic application of ALT (10 mg/kg) or DOI (0.5 mg/kg) and the respective vehicles [dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 0.9% saline (SAL)] with [I-123]IBZM as a single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) radioligand. Anatomical information for the delineation of the target regions was obtained with dedicated small animal MRI. Immediately after 5-HT2AR antagonistic or agonistic treatment, motor/exploratory behaviors were assessed for 45 (ALT) or 30 min (DOI) in an open field. Additional rats underwent behavioral measurements after injection of DMSO or SAL. Results: ALT increased D2/3R binding in the ventral hippocampus relative to vehicle, while DOI augmented D2/3R binding in caudate putamen, frontal cortex, motor cortex, and ventral hippocampus. The 5-HT2AR agonist as well as antagonist decreased parameters of motor activity and active exploration. However, ALT, in contrast to DOI, decreased explorative head-shoulder motility and increased sitting. Conclusions: The regional increases of D2/3R binding after ALT and DOI (90 and 75 min post-challenge) may be conceived to reflect decreases of synaptic DA. The reductions of motor/exploratory activities (min 1-45 and min 1-30 after challenge with ALT and DOI, respectively) contrast the regional reductions of D2/3R binding, as they indicate elevated DA levels at the time of behavioral measurements. It may be concluded that ALT and DOI modulate DA in the individual regions of the nigrostriatal and mesolimbocortical pathways differentially and in a time-dependent fashion.

Systematic evaluation of a panel of 30 synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists structurally related to MMB-4en-PICA, MDMB-4en-PINACA, ADB-4en-PINACA, and MMB-4CN-BUTINACA using a combination of binding and different CB<sub>1</sub> receptor activation assays: Part I-Synthesis, analytical characterization, and binding affinity for human CB<sub>1</sub> receptors	DRUG TESTING AND ANALYSIS			English	Article						4en; ADB; cannabinoid; MDMB; PINACA	PHARMACOLOGICAL EVALUATION; POTENT; CONSTITUENTS; INDAZOLE; FUBINACA; INDOLE; DRUGS	Synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists (SCRAs) are one of the largest and most structurally diverse classes of new psychoactive substances (NPS). Despite this, pharmacological data are often lacking following the identification of a new SCRA in drug markets. In this first of a three-part series, we describe the synthesis, analytical characterization, and binding affinity of a proactively generated, systematic library of 30 indole, indazole, and 7-azaindole SCRAs related to MMB-4en-PICA, MDMB-4en-PINACA, ADB-4en-PINACA, and MMB-4CN-BUTINACA featuring a 4-pentenyl (4en-P), butyl (B/BUT), or 4-cyanobutyl (4CN-B/BUT) tail and a methyl l-valinate (MMB), methyl l-tert-leucinate (MDMB), methyl l-phenylalaninate (MPP), l-valinamide (AB), l-tert-leucinamide (ADB), l-phenylalaninamide (APP), adamantyl (A), or cumyl head group. Competitive radioligand binding assays demonstrated that the indazole core conferred the highest CB1 binding affinity (K-i = 0.17-39 nM), followed by indole- (K-i = 0.95-160 nM) and then 7-azaindole-derived SCRAs (K-i = 5.4-271 nM). Variation of the head group had the greatest effect on binding, with tert-leucine amides and methyl esters (K-i = 0.17-14 nM) generally showing the greatest affinities, followed by valine derivatives (K-i = 0.72-180 nM), and then phenylalanine derivatives (K-i = 2.5-271 nM). Adamantyl head groups (K-i = 8.8-59 nM) were suboptimal for binding, whereas the cumyl analogues consistently conferred high affinity (K-i = 0.62-36 nM). Finally, both butyl (K-i = 3.1-163 nM) and 4-cyanobutyl (K-i = 5.5-44 nM) tail groups were less favorable for CB1 binding than their corresponding 4-pentenyl counterparts (K-i = 0.72-25 nM).

CAA is also associated with strokes due to lobar intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). F-18-flutemetamol amyloid ligand PET may improve the early detection of CAA. We performed pharmacokinetic modelling using both full (0-30, 90-120 min) and reduced (30 min) F-18-flutemetamol PET-MR acquisitions, to investigate regional cerebral perfusion and amyloid deposition in ICH patients. Methods: Dynamic F-18-flutemetamol PET-MR was performed in a pilot cohort of sixteen ICH participants; eight lobar ICH cases with probable CAA and eight deep ICH patients. A model-based input function (mIF) method was developed for compartmental modelling. mIF 1-tissue (1-TC) and 2-tissue (2-TC) compartmental modelling, reference tissue models and standardized uptake value ratios were assessed in the setting of probable CAA detection. Results: The mIF 1-TC model detected perfusion deficits and F-18-flutemetamol uptake in cases with probable CAA versus deep ICH patients, in both full and reduced PET acquisition time (all P < 0.05). In the reduced PET acquisition, mIF 1-TC modelling reached the highest sensitivity and specificity in detecting perfusion deficits (0.87, 0.77) and F-18-flutemetamol uptake (0.83, 0.71) in cases with probable CAA. Overall, 52 and 48 out of the 64 brain areas with F-18-flutemetamol-determined amyloid deposition showed reduced perfusion for 1-TC and 2-TC models, respectively. Conclusion: Pharmacokinetic (1-TC) modelling using a 30 min PET-MR time frame detected impaired haemodynamics and increased amyloid load in probable CAA. Perfusion deficits and amyloid burden co-existed within cases with CAA, demonstrating a distinct imaging pattern which may have merit in elucidating the pathophysiological process of CAA.

Therefore, we designed a novel positron emission tomography (PET) tracer based on a tropane derivative through C-2 modification to conjugate NOTA for chelating Ga-68, a radioisotope derived from a Ge-68/Ga-68 generator. Methods: IPCAT-NOTA 22 was synthesized and labeled with [Ga-68]GaCl4- at room temperature. Biological studies on serum stability, LogP, and in vitro autoradiography (binding assay and competitive assay) were performed. Furthermore, ex vivo autoradiography, biodistribution, and dynamic PET imaging studies were performed in Sprague Dawley rats. Results: [ 68 Ga]IPCAT-NOTA 24 obtained had a radiochemical yield of >= 90% and a specific activity of 4.25 MBq/nmol. [Ga-68]IPCAT-NOTA 24 of 85% radiochemical purity (RCP%) was stable at 37 degrees C for up to 60 minutes in serum with a lipophilicity of 0.88. The specific binding ratio (SBR%) reached 15.8 +/- 6.7 at 60 minutes, and the 85% specific uptake could be blocked through co-injection at 100- and 1000-fold of the cold precursor in in vitro binding studies. Tissue regional distribution studies in rats with [Ga-68]IPCAT-NOTA 24 showed striatal uptake (0.02% at 5 minutes and 0.007% at 60 minutes) with SBR% of 6%, 25%, and 62% at 5-15, 30-40, and 60-70 minutes, respectively, in NanoPET studies. The RCP% of [Ga-68]IPCAT-NOTA 24 at 30 minutes in vivo remained 67.65%. Conclusion: Data described here provide new information on the design of PET probe of conjugate/pendent approach for DAT imaging Another chelator or another direct method of intracranial injection must be used to prove the relation between [Ga-68]IPCAT-NOTA 24 uptake and transporter localization.

In this study, we investigated the spatial distribution of neuroinflammation in MCI subjects, using spectral analysis (SA) to generate parametric maps and quantify C-11-PBR28 PET, and compared these with compartmental and other kinetic models of quantification. Methods Thirteen MCI and nine healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Subjects underwent C-11-PBR28 PET scans with arterial cannulation. Spectral analysis with an arterial plasma input function was used to generate C-11-PBR28 parametric maps. These maps were then compared with regional C-11-PBR28 V-T (volume of distribution) using a two-tissue compartment model and Logan graphic analysis. Amyloid load was also assessed with F-18-Flutemetamol PET. Result With SA, three component peaks were identified in addition to blood volume. The C-11-PBR28 impulse response function (IRF) at 90 min produced the lowest coefficient of variation. Single-subject analysis using this IRF demonstrated microglial activation in five out of seven amyloid-positive MCI subjects. IRF parametric maps of C-11-PBR28 uptake revealed a group-wise significant increase in neuroinflammation in amyloid-positive MCI subjects versus HC in multiple cortical association areas, and particularly in the temporal lobe. Interestingly, compartmental analysis detected group-wise increase in C-11-PBR28 binding in the thalamus of amyloid-positive MCI subjects, while Logan parametric maps did not perform well. Conclusions This study demonstrates for the first time that spectral analysis can be used to generate parametric maps of C-11-PBR28 uptake, and is able to detect microglial activation in amyloid-positive MCI subjects. IRF parametric maps of C-11-PBR28 uptake allow voxel-wise single-subject analysis and could be used to evaluate microglial activation in individual subjects.

J	Grafström, J; Stone-Elander, S				Grafstrom, Jonas; Stone-Elander, Sharon			Comparison of methods for evaluating radiolabelled Annexin A5 uptake in pre-clinical PET oncological studies	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Positron emission tomography; AnnexinA5; Logan method; Distribution volume ratio; Enhanced permeability and retention effects	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; TUMOR VASCULAR-PERMEABILITY; BRAIN TRANSFER CONSTANTS; GRAPHICAL ANALYSIS; BINDING; MODEL; APOPTOSIS; CANCER; SPECT	Purpose: The uptakes of radiolabel led AnnexinA5 (AnxA5) and a size-matched control protein in experimental tumours were evaluated by kinetic analyses and compared with standard uptake values (SUVs) to investigate whether the method of analysis may impact on the conclusions that can be drawn. Procedures: PET scans of the C-11-labelled proteins performed in untreated and doxorubicin-treated mice with head and neck carcinoma xenografts were retrospectively analysed. The appropriateness of using the Logan graphical analyses for reversibly binding radiotracers in these models was evaluated and confirmed. Distribution volume ratios (DVRs) of the regions of interest to reference muscle tissue were compared to those based on the image-derived input function from arterial blood. SUVs were calculated in the same individuals. Results: DVRs based on reference muscle tissue gave results similar to those based on the arterial blood and may be preferred since they are simpler to calculate. In the inter-group comparisons of baseline versus chemotherapy treatment or AnxA5 versus control protein, differences in DVR quantifications had a 20- to 40-fold higher statistical significance than differences in SUVs. As quantified using the control protein, the amount of free ligand in the vascular space of tumours may be large due to enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) contributions at baseline and affected during treatment, which has implications for quantifications of the specifically bound radioligand. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that the quantification method as well as the controls used can be important for interpreting the uptake in tumours of the medium-sized protein ligand AnxA5 and its use in monitoring the effects of therapy on cell death in the tumours. Advances in knowledge and implications for patient care: These results provide additional support for the recognition that more detailed investigations on the effects of the tumour microenvironment on the targeting capability of imaging radiopharmaceuticals are needed.

Analgesic latencies were assessed in mouse tail-flick assays after intrathecal administration. In vitro receptor autoradiography, binding and ligand-stimulated [(35)S]GTP gamma S functional assays were performed in the presence of putative delta(1)-(DPDPE: agonist, BNTX: antagonist), delta(2)-(agonist: deltorphin II, IIe(5.6)-deltorphin II, antagonist: naltriben) and mu-(DAMGO: agonist) opioid ligands. The examined antagonist inhibited the effect of DPDPE by 60%, but did not antagonize delta(2)- and mu-agonist induced analgesia. The radiolabeled form identified binding sites with K(D) = 0.18 nM and receptor densities of 102.7 fmol/mg protein in mouse brain membranes. The binding site distribution of the [[(3)H]Tyr-Tic-(25,3R)-beta-MePhe-Phe-OH agreed well with that of [(3)H]Ile(5,6)-deltorphin 11 as revealed by receptor autoradiography. Tyr-Tic-(2S,3R)-beta-MePhe-Phe-OH displayed 2.49 +/- 0.06 and 0.30 +/- 0.01 nM potency against DPDPE and deltorphin 11 in the [(35)S]GTP gamma S functional assay, respectively. The rank order of potency of putative delta(1)- and delta(2)-antagonists against DPDPE and deltorphin was similar in brain and CHO cells expressing human delta-opioid receptors. Deletion of the DOR-1 gene resulted in no residual binding of the radioligand and no significant DPDPE effect on G-protein activation. Tyr-Tic-(2S,3R)-beta-MePhe-Phe-OH is a highly potent and delta-opioid specific antagonist both in vivo and in vitro. However, the putative delta(1)- and delta(2)-opioid receptors could not be unequivocally distinguished in vitro. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In-vivo imaging characteristics of two fluorinated flumazenil radiotracers in the rat	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						Radioligand; Flumazenil; PET; Rat; GABA(A)/cBZ receptor	PET; <F-18>FLUOROETHYLFLUMAZENIL; BIODISTRIBUTION	[C-11]Flumazenil shows promise as a clinical and research PET radiotracer to image changes in GABA(A) central benzodiazepine receptor (cBZR), but its widespread use has been limited by practical limitations of [C-11]. This study evaluated the imaging characteristics of two fluorinated PET radiotracers in rats in vivo: [F-18]fluoroflumazenil ([F-18]FFMZ) and [F-18]flumazenil ([F-18]FMZ). PET acquisitions were performed on a small-animal scanner following injection of [F-18]FFMZ in nine rats and [F-18]FMZ in eight rats. The following treatments were investigated: (1) injection of the tracer dose, (2) presaturation then injection of the tracer dose, and (3) injection of the tracer dose followed by a displacement injection. Unchanged tracer was measured in plasma and brain structures in four animals 10 and 30 min after injection, and ex-vivo autoradiography was also performed. For both [F-18]FFMZ and [F-18]FMZ maximal brain activity peaked rapidly, and was highest in the hippocampus (1.12 +/- 0.06 SUV, 1.24 +/- 0.10 SUV, respectively), and lowest in the pons (1.00 +/- 0.07 SUV, 1.03 +/- 0.09 SUV, respectively). By 50 min after injection, maximal uptake for [F-18]FFMZ and [F-18]FMZ had decreased in the hippocampus to 18 +/- 3% and 80 +/- 1% (p < 0.01), respectively. The presaturation and displacement studies showed a higher nonspecific component for [F-18]FFMZ than for [F-18]FMZ. Metabolite studies showed that at 30 min only 10% of the signal was from [F-18]FFMZ in the brain. This nonspecific binding was apparent on autoradiography. In contrast, [F-18]FMZ accounted for > 70% of the signal in the brain, which resulted in well-defined regional binding on autoradiography. These results demonstrate that [F-18]FMZ is a superior radiotracer to [F-18]FFMZ for in-vivo PET imaging of the GABA(A)/cBZR, having slower metabolism and leading to lower concentrations of metabolites in the brain that results in a substantially better signal-to-noise ratio.

We have recently shown that AT(1)R density in the acute phase of MI determines post-MI ventricular remodeling at discharge (8 days). The aim of this study was to test whether this correlation is retained in a longer follow-up (6 months), in the same group of patients. Methods: In 48 patients with first acute MI who did not undergo reperfusion therapy, angiotensin AT(1)R density on blood platelets (a presumable marker of cardiovascular AT(1)R density) was assessed 13 +/- 5 h after the onset of MI, using radioligand binding assay. Echocardiographic indices of left ventricular function and dimensions were used as measures of ventricular remodeling. Results: 6 months after the infarction patients who at baseline had AT(1)R density above median (N=17) as compared to those with AT(1)R density below median (N=20) had higher left ventricular end-systolic volume index (LVESVI, 41.3 +/- 2.7 vs. 33.2 +/- 2.3) and lower ejection fraction (LVEF 48.1 +/- 1.8 vs. 54.7 +/- 2.0). Moreover LVESVI positively and LVEF negatively correlated with AT(1)R density although the strength of these correlations was weaker than at discharge. Infarct size as reflected by a single troponin T measurement and post-MI therapy did not differ between high-and low-AT(1)R groups: over 85% patients received ACE-inhibitor, beta-blocker and statin. Conclusions: High AT(1)R density on blood platelets (a presumable marker of cardiovascular AT(1)R density) drawn in the acute phase of MI predicts poorer left ventricular systolic function in 6-month follow up. This suggests that modern therapy offers suboptimal blockade of renin-angiotensin system activity in the setting of MI. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The binding potential (BP), a parameter for the regional cerebral opioid receptor availability, was computed using the occipital cortex as reference region. The following regions of interest (ROIs) were defined on individual MR images: thalamus, sensor), motor strip (SI/MI area), frontal operculum, parietal operculum, anterior insular cortex, posterior insular cortex, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; peri- and subgenual part of "classical ACC" only), midcingulate cortex (MCC, posterior part of "classical ACC"), putamen, caudate nucleus and the amygdala. BP for [F-18]fluoroethyl-diprenorphine was lowest in the sensory motor strip (0.30). Highest BP was found in thalamus (1.36), basal ganglia (putamen 1.22, caudate 1.16) and amygdala (1.21). In the cingulate cortex, ACC (1.11) had higher BP than MCC (0.86). In the operculo-insular region, we found high BPs in all ROIs: anterior insula (1.16), posterior insula (1.05), frontal operculum (0.99) and parietal operculum (0.77). Factor analysis of interindividual variabilitv of opiate receptor BP revealed four factors (95% explained variance): (1) operculo-insular areas, ACC, MCC and putamen, (2) amygdala and thalamus, (3) caudate and thalamus, (4) SUMI and MCC. Nociceptive areas of the lateral pain system (frontoparietal operculum and insula) have opiate receptor BPs significantly higher than SI/Ml, comparable to anterior and miticingulate areas of the medial pain system. These findings suggest that the cortical antinociceptive effects of opiates are not only mediated by ACC and MCC, but also by the operculo-insular cortex, if it can be assumed that opioid binding mediates anti-nociception in those structures.

Design: A 23-month case-control study. Setting: Small social groups in the laboratory. Subjects: Seventeen adult female cynomolgus monkeys. Main Outcome Measures: Serotonin 1A receptor BP was examined by positron emission tomography using the radioligand 4,2'-(methoxyphenyl)-1-[2'-(N-2'-pyridinyl)-p-fluorobenzamido] ethylpiperazine in the raphe, amygdala, hippocampus, and anterior cingulate cortex in monkeys characterized by behavioral observation as depressed or not depressed. Aggression, submission, affiliation, pathologic behaviors, and activity levels were determined by behavioral observation. Heart rate and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function were also determined. Results: Throughout the brain areas examined, there was a reduction in 5-HT1A BP in depressed monkeys. The 5-HT1A BP in the amygdala and hippocampus was associated with aggression and submission. Friendly interaction, grooming, and locomotion were associated with 5-HT1A BP in the left cingulate cortex, whereas attention directed toward the environment was associated with 5-HT1A BP in the right cingulate cortex. The 5-HT1A receptor BP was inversely associated with heart rate in the raphe, left cingulate, and right amygdala. Conclusions: This is the fourth in a series of studies that suggest that depressive behavior in adult female cynomolgus monkeys is similar to that observed in humans. It has been observed in 2 large groups of monkeys randomly selected from feral populations, suggesting that the capacity for depression is inherent in the species. This animal model holds promise to further our understanding of the basic mechanisms of affective behavior, the neuropathophysiologic characteristics of depression and the cognitive dysfunction that accompanies them, genetic and environmental factors that may affect depression risk, and the role of reproductive function in the excess depression risk in women.

This work was conducted to evaluate the specific effects of NO on mu-opioid receptor activity. To investigate the effects of morphine- and L-arginine (the NO precursor)-induced increases in NO, five groups of rats were treated with saline, L-arginine (100-, 300-, or 500-mg/kg/h), or morphine 3-mg/kg/h for 8 It on Day 1; brain tissue was collected on Day 2. To evaluate the effects of additional increases in NO on morphine-induced alterations of the mu-opioid receptor, six groups of rats were treated with 8-h intravenous infusions for two consecutive days as per the following scheme (Day I:Day 2): saline:saline (control); saline:morphine 3-mg/kg/h (tolerant); L-arginine 500-mg/kg/h: saline (NO control); L-arginine 100-mg/kg/h: morphine 3-mg/kg/h; L-arginine 300-mg/kg/h: morphine 3-mg/kg/h; and L-arginine 500-mg/kg/h:morphine 3-mg/kg/h (supertolerant). Brain tissue was collected at the end of Day 2. The time course of effects on morphine-induced receptor alterations due to increased NO also was evaluated. Brain tissue was analyzed for changes in radioligand (agonist and antagonist) binding and [S-35]GTPgammaS binding (agonist and antagonist). In the absence of agonist exposure, NO produced an alteration in the R-opioid receptor that increased receptor activity. In the presence of agonist, NO increased constitutive activation of the mu-opioid receptor and reduced the ability of a selective mu-opioid agonist to activate the mu-opioid G-protein-coupled receptor; these molecular effects occurred in a time course consistent with the development of antinociceptive tolerance. This work establishes important NO-induced alterations in L-opioid receptor functionality, which directly lead to the development of opioid antinociceptive tolerance. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Although environmental contaminants (xenoestrogens) which interfere with estrogen signaling are of increasing concern, there is only limited information about their ability to interact with estrogen-binding proteins (SHBG) or receptors (ER). Recombinant ERalpha and beta were obtained after transient transfection of COS-7 cells with channel catfish ER cDNA. Plasma from adult female channel catfish was the source of SHBG. Tritiated estradiol (H-3-E-2) was used in standard radioligand-binding assays to characterize the binding properties of channel catfish SHBG (ccfSHBG) and to estimate the inhibition constants for various estrogenic compounds. Binding of H-3-E-2 to ccfSHBG was saturable and of high affinity with a K-d (+/-SE) of 1.9 +/- 0.14 nM and a B-max of 14.3 +/- 2.4 pmol/mg protein (n = 3 assays). Additionally, ccfSHBG displayed binding specificity for androgens and estrogens. Endosulfan, 4-nonylphenol, and 4-octylphenol displaced H-3-E-2 binding to ccfSHBG albeit only at very high concentrations, whereas dieldrin and atrazine showed little displacement activity even at the highest concentrations used. The synthetic estrogen ethynylestradiol had higher affinity than E, for ccfSHBG. This finding differs from results with human and rainbow trout SHBG. The alkylphenolic compounds (4-octylphenol and 4-nonylphenol) displayed some ability to displace H-3-E-2 binding from ERalpha and beta at high concentrations, but dieldrin and atrazine had little binding activity for both ER subtypes and endosulfan for ERbeta. The xenobiotics tested generally showed equivalent or greater affinity for ERalpha than ERbeta, whereas natural estrogens had much greater affinity for ERbeta than ERalpha. These observations suggest that results of studies using fish tissue ER extracts must be interpreted with caution, since both ER subtypes may be present, and that the binding of xenoestrogens to SHBG must be taken into account for proper assessment of endocrine disruption caused by environmental contaminants.

In contrast to the prototypical mAChR allosteric modulator, heptane 1,7-bis-(dimethyl-3'-phthalimidopropyl)-ammonium bromide (C-7/3-phth), SCH-202676 had no effect on the dissociation kinetics of [H-3] N-methylscopolamine ([H-3]NMS) at M-1 mAChRs stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell membranes. However, SCH-202676 completely inhibited the binding of [H-3] NMS in membrane preparations, with a Hill slope significantly greater than unity, indicative of positive cooperativity in the binding of the inhibitor. Moreover, SCH-202676 caused dextral shifts of the [H-3] NMS saturation binding curve that were greater than expected for a competitive interaction. The addition of C-7/3-phth (100 muM) had no significant effect on the inhibitory potency of SCH-202676. In contrast to the findings in cell membranes, the interaction between SCH-202676 and [H-3] NMS in intact M-1 CHO cells yielded saturation and inhibition isotherms that were compatible with the predictions for a competitive interaction. Intact cell assays of acetylcholine-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis in the absence or presence of SCH-202676 revealed a mixed competitive/noncompetitive mode of interaction that was dependent on the concentration of SCH-202676. These data reveal that the nature of the interaction between SCH-202676 and the M-1 mAChR is dependent on whether it is studied using intact versus broken cell preparations. It is proposed that SCH-202676 uses a dual mode of ligand-receptor interaction involving both extra-and intracellular attachment points on the M-1 mAChR that are distinct from the allosteric binding site recognized by prototypical mAChR modulators such as C-7/3-phth.

Study design Prospective experimental study. Animals Three dogs (3 years of age) and three horses (2-5 years of age). Animals were opioid- and alpha-2 agonist-free at the time of euthanasia. Methods Brain tissue was obtained at 126 days post-surgery from dogs and 72 days post-surgery from horses. The brains were removed, sectioned coronally into 1-cm slabs, frozen in methylbutane, which was cooled by liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70degreesC. Receptor autoradiography was performed using established techniques. [H-3]DAMGO, [H-3]U-69593, and [H-3]RX821.002 were used for mu (mu)-opioid, kappa (kappa)-opioid, and alpha-2 adrenergic-binding assays, respectively. Species differences were analyzed separately for each major brain region by repeated measures ANOVA for subregions followed by Fisher's protected Latin square design (LSD). p < 0.05 was considered significant. Results There was higher binding of mu-opioid receptors in the frontal cortex. left somatosensory cortex. colliculus (mid-brain), and granule cell layer of the cerebellum of horses than that of dogs. There was higher binding to kappa-opioid receptors in the frontal cortex of dogs compared to horses, whereas binding to kappa-Opioid receptors in the cerebellum was higher in horses. Binding to alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in the mid-brain was significantly higher in dogs than in horses. There was higher binding of alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in the dorsomedial and dorsolateral peria-queductal grey of dogs as compared to that of horses. Conclusion The results of this study show that the distribution of these receptors is different between horses and dogs. Further work is needed to understand the relevance of these differences to clinical responses to opioids and alpha-2 adrenergic agonists in these species.

Tachyphylaxis to SST analogues is not documented in acromegaly. We describe such a phenomenon. Design and methods: A 74-year-old female with acromegaly previously treated with Y-90 implant, external radiotherapy and thrice daily s.c. octreotide had stable GH levels of 19 mU/l. GH progressively rose following switches to lanreotide and depot octreotide as Sandostatin LAR: from 29 to 126 mU/l. Magnetic resonance imaging and In-111-pentetreotide scanning revealed no tumour growth or alteration in SST receptor (SSTR) status. Tachyphylaxis to SST analogues was considered. Therapy was discontinued and re-introduced in daily 200 mug/24 h increments by continuous s.c. infusion, to a maximum of 1000 mug/24 h, and maintained over 3 weeks with daily, followed by weekly, GH profiles. Competitive I-125-octreotide radioligand binding assays measured in vitro bio-activity of anti-SST analogue antibodies. In vitro SSTR binding studies utilised SSTR-expressing rat cortex membrane. Results: Median GH fell by 93% from 504 to 39.5 mU/l and rose reproducibly on continued infusion to 120 mU/l. Octreotide withdrawal for 16 h produced a 64% increase in sensitivity. High-affinity IgG anti-lanreotide (IC50 = 18 7 pmol/l) and anti-octreotide (IC50 = 82 nmol/l) antibody, with no cross-reactivity with natural SST, was demonstrated. In vitro inhibition of 125 I-octreotide SSTR binding by anti-SST analogue crossreacting antibody was observed at 1:1 serum dilution. Conclusions: This is the first report of tachyphylaxis to SST analogues in acromegaly. We believe that the short time course of resensitisation following acute octreotide withdrawal is suggestive of an effect(s) on receptor function or on the receptor signal transduction cascade at sites further downstream, rather than an immune-mediated phenomenon.

J	Bücheler, MM; Hadamek, K; Hein, L				Bücheler, MM; Hadamek, K; Hein, L			Two α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor subtypes, α<sub>2A</sub> and α<sub>2C</sub>, inhibit transmitter release in the brain of gene-targeted mice	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						adrenergic receptors; presynaptic receptor; dopamine; norepinephrine; transgenic mouse	PRESYNAPTIC ALPHA(2)-AUTORECEPTORS; ALPHA-2-ADRENERGIC RECEPTORS; DOPAMINE RELEASE; RAT; MODULATION; PHARMACOLOGY; ALPHA-2C10; SLICES; PULSES	alpha(2)-Adrenergic receptors play an essential role in regulating neurotransmitter release from sympathetic nerves and from adrenergic neurons in the CNS. However, the role of each of the three highly homologous alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor subtypes (alpha(2A), alpha(2B), alpha(2C)) in this process has not been determined unequivocally. To address this question, the regulation of norepinephrine and dopamine release was studied in mice carrying deletions in the genes encoding the three alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor subtypes. Autoradiography and radioligand binding studies showed that alpha(2)-receptor density in alpha(2A)-deficient brains was decreased to 9 +/- 1% of the respective wild-type value, whereas alpha(2)-receptor levels were reduced to 83 +/- 4% in alpha(2C)-deficient mice. These results indicate that approximately 90% of mouse brain alpha(2)-receptors belong to the alpha(2A) subtype and 10% are alpha(2C)-receptors, In isolated brain cortex slices from wild-type mice a non-subtype-selective alpha(2)-receptor agonist inhibited release of [H-3]norepinephrine by maximally 96%. Similarly, release of [H-3]dopamine from isolated basal ganglion slices was inhibited by 76% by an alpha(2)-receptor agonist. In alpha(2A)-receptor-deficient mice, the inhibitory effect of the alpha(2)-receptor agonist on norepinephrine and dopamine release was significantly reduced but not abolished. Only in tissues from mice lacking both alpha(2A)- and alpha(2C)-receptors was no alpha(2)-receptor agonist effect on transmitter release observed. The time course of onset of presynaptic inhibition of norepinephrine release was much faster for the alpha(2A)-receptor than for the alpha(2C)-subtype. After prolonged stimulation with norepinephrine, presynaptic alpha(2C)-adrenergic receptors were desensitized. From these data we suggest that two functionally distinct alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor subtypes, alpha(2A) and alpha(2C), operate as presynaptic inhibitory receptors regulating neurotransmitter release in the mouse CNS.

Binding of the ligand was studied in membranes from human embryonic kidney cells transfected with the sulphonylurea receptor isoforms, SUR2B and SURA, respectively. 2 PKF217-744 was confirmed as being a K-ATP channel opener by its ability to open the Kir6.1/ SUR2B channel, the recombinant form of the vascular K-ATP channel, and to inhibit binding of the pinacidil analogue, [H-3]-P1075, to SUR2B (K-t = 26 nM). 3 The kinetics of [H-3]-PKF217-744 binding to SUR2B was described by rate constants of association and dissociation of 6.9 x 10(6) M-1 min(-1) and 0.09 min(-1), respectively. 4 Binding of [H-3]-PKF217-744 to SUR2B/2A was activated by MgATP (EC50 approximate to 3 muM) and inhibited (SUR2B) or enhanced (SUR2A) by MgADP. 5 Binding of [H-3]-PKF217-744 to SUR2B was inhibited by representatives of the different structural classes of openers and sulphonylureas. K-t values were identical with those obtained using the opener [H-3]-P1075 as the radioligand. 6 Glibenclamide accelerated dissociation of the SUR2B-[H-3]-PKF217-744 complex. 7 The data show that the affinity of [H-3]-PKF217-744 binding to SUR2B is approximate to 6 times lower than that of [H-3]-P1075. This is due to a surprisingly slow association rate of the benzopyran-type ligand, suggesting a complex mechanism of opener binding to SUR. The other pharmacological properties of the two opener radioligands are identical.

This study evaluated the effects of dietary sodium manipulation in dogs on the regulation of canine angiotensin receptors (cAT(1) and cAT(2)) in the kidney and adrenal. Methods. Isolated glomeruli and membranes from renal medulla and the adrenal gland were used in radioligand binding assays from two groups of dogs: dogs maintained on low-sodium diet for two weeks followed by a high-sodium diet for two weeks (H), and dogs were maintained on the reverse schedule (L). Results. Analysis of the binding data showed that dietary sodium manipulation had no significant effects on cAT(1) and cAT(2) receptor binding affinities in glomeruli, renal medulla, and adrenal tissues. In contrast, dietary sodium loading induced a marked increase in cAT(1) receptor expression in both the glomeruli and adrenal compared with receptor expression in salt-restricted animals [H/L ratio: glomeruli (1.5), renal medulla (1.1), adrenal (1.6)] that inversely correlated with the activity of the plasma renin angiotensin system. Conversely, adrenal cAT(2) receptor expression was regulated in an inverse manner in the H and L animal groups [H/L ratio: 0.7]. Conclusions. This study demonstrates that renal glomerular and adrenal AT(1) receptors in the dog are coordinately downregulated by dietary sodium restriction compared with sodium loading, which is distinctly different from the reciprocal regulation observed for rat AT(1) receptors in these tissues. Collectively, these data suggest that postreceptor events in dogs are determinants of the aldosterone response observed during sodium restriction. These findings have important implications for the regulation of the renin-angiotensin system in humans, and suggest that coordinate regulation of AT(1) receptors in the adrenal and glomeruli represent a negative feedback mechanism that when functioning normally prevents fluctuations of arterial blood pressure and development of arterial hypertension in response to changes ill dietary sodium.

It acts upon cells of the osteoblastic Lineage via the G protein-coupled type-1 PTH/PTH-related peptide receptor (PTH1R). Carboxyl fragments of intact PTH(1-84) (C-PTH fragments) are cosecreted with it by the parathyroid glands in a calcium-dependent manner and also are generated via proteolysis of the hormone in peripheral tissues. Receptors that recognize C-PTH fragments (CPTHRs) have been described previously in osteoblastic and chondrocytic cells. To directly study CPTHRs in bone cells, we isolated clonal, conditionally transformed cell lines from fetal calvarial bone of mice that are homozygous for targeted ablation of the PTH1R gene and transgenically express a temperature-sensitive mutant SV40 T antigen. Cells with the highest specific binding of the CPTHR radio-ligand I-125-[Tyr(34)]hPTH(19-84) exhibited a stellate, dendritic appearance suggestive of an osteocytic phenotype and expressed 6- to 10-fold more CPTHR sites/cell than did osteoblastic cells previously isolated from the same bones. In these osteocytic (OC) cells, expression of mRNAs for CD44, connexin 43, and osteocalcin was high, whereas that for alkaline phosphatase and cbfa-1/osf-2 was negligible. The CPTHR radioligand was displaced completely by hPTH(1-84), hPTH(19-84) and hPTH(24-84) (IC(50)s = 20-50 nM) and by kPTH(39-84) (IC50 = 500 nM) but only minimally (24%) by 10,000 nM hPTH(1-34). CPTHR binding was down-regulated dose dependently by hPTH(1-84), an effect mimicked by ionomycin and active phorbol ester. Human PTH(1-84) and hPTH(39-84) altered connexin 43 expression and increased apoptosis in OC cells. Apoptosis induced by PTH(1-84) was blocked by the caspase inhibitor DEVD, We conclude that osteocytes, the most abundant cells in bone, may be principal target cells for unique actions of intact PTH(1-84) and circulating PTH C-fragments that are mediated by CPTHRs.

Animal experiments have shown that 4-(2'-methoxyphenyl)-1-[2'-(N-2 " -pyridinyl)-p-[F-18]fluorobenzamido]ethylpiperazine ([F-18]MPPF) may be suitable for 5-HT1A receptor imaging in humans. The aim of this study was to determine if [F-18]MPPF can be used for the quantitative analysis of 5-HT1A receptor densities in brain regions of healthy human volunteers. Methods: [O-15]H2O perfusion scanning was performed before intravenous injection of [F-18]MPPF to obtain anatomic information. Cerebral radioactivity was monitored using a PET camera. Plasma metabolites of [F-18]MPPF were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Binding potentials were calculated using the metabolite-corrected arterial input function and a linear graphic method (Logan-Patlak analysis). Results: The highest levels of radioactivity were observed in the medial temporal cortex, especially in the hippocampal area. In contrast, the cerebellum and basal ganglia showed low uptake of F-18, in accordance with known 5-HT1A receptor distribution. The calculated binding potentials correlated well with literature values for 5-HT1A receptor densities. The binding potentials for [F-18]MPPF were 4-6 times lower than those that have been reported for [carbonyl-C-11]-(N-(2-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl)ethyl)-N-(2-pyridyl) cyclohexane-carboxamide (WAY 100635), indicating that [F-18]MPPF has a lower in vivo affinity for 5-HT1A receptors. Conclusion: These results confirm that [F-18]MPPF can be used for the quantitative analysis of 5-HT1A receptor distribution in the living human brain. The:rapid dissociation from the receptor makes this ligand a possible candidate to monitor changes in endogenous serotonin levels.

It is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, but it can also activate the G-protein coupled receptor 35 (GPR35), which shares several structural and functional properties with cannabinoid receptors. Previously our group demonstrated that systemic chronic KYNA treatment altered opioid receptor G-protein activity. Opioid receptors also overlap in many features with cannabinoid receptors. Thus, our aim was to examine the direct in vitro and systemic, chronic in vivo effect of KYNA on type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1R) binding and G-protein activity. Based on competition and [S-35]GTP gamma S G-protein binding assays in rat brain, KYNA alone did not show significant binding towards the CB1R, nor did it alter CB1R ligand binding and agonist activity in vitro. When rats were chronically treated with KYNA (single daily, i.p., 128 mg/kg for 9 days), the KYNA plasma and cerebrospinal fluid levels significantly increased compared to vehicle treated group. Furthermore, in G-protein binding assays, in the whole brain the amount of G-proteins in basal and in maximum activity coupled to the CB1R also increased due to the treatment. At the same time, the overall stimulatory properties of the receptor remained unaltered in vehicle and KYNA treated samples. Similar observations were made in rat hippocampus, but not in the cortex and brainstem. In saturation binding assays the density of CB(1)Rs in rat whole brain and hippocampus were also significantly enhanced after the same treatment, without significantly affecting ligand binding affinity. Thus, KYNA indirectly and brain region specifically increases the abundance of functional CB(1)Rs, without modifying the overall binding and activity of the receptor. Supposedly, this can be a compensatory mechanism on the part of the endocannabinoid system induced by the long-term KYNA exposure.

Objectives To explore the usefulness of [C-11]pyridinyl-butadienyl-benzothiazole 3/PET in assessing characteristic distributions of tau pathologies and their association with clinical symptoms in the brains of living PSP patients. Methods We assessed 13 PSP patients and 13 age-matched healthy control subjects. Individuals negative for amyloid beta PET with [C-11]Pittsburgh compound B underwent clinical scoring, MR scans, and [C-11]pyridinyl-butadienyl-benzothiazole 3/PET. Results There were significant differences in binding potential for [C-11]pyridinyl-butadienyl-benzothiazole 3 between PSP patients and healthy control subjects (P = 0.02). PSP patients exhibited greater radioligand retention than healthy control subjects in multiple brain regions, including frontoparietal white matter, parietal gray matter, globus pallidus, STN, red nucleus, and cerebellar dentate nucleus. [C-11]pyridinyl-butadienyl-benzothiazole 3 deposition in frontoparietal white matter, but not gray matter, was correlated with general severity of parkinsonian and PSP symptoms, whereas both gray matter and white matter [C-11]pyridinyl-butadienyl-benzothiazole 3 accumulations in the frontoparietal cortices were associated with nonverbal cognitive impairments. Autoradiographic and fluorescence labeling with pyridinyl-butadienyl-benzothiazole 3 was observed in gray matter and white matter of PSP motor cortex tissues. Conclusions Our findings support the in vivo detectability of tau fibrils characteristic of PSP by [C-11]pyridinyl-butadienyl-benzothiazole 3/PET, and imply distinct and synergistic contributions of gray matter and white matte tau pathologies to clinical symptoms. [C-11]pyridinyl-butadienyl-benzothiazole 3/PET potentially provides a neuroimaging-based index for the evolution of PSP tau pathologies promoting the deterioration of motor and cognitive functions.

Positive N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor Modulation by Rapastinel Promotes Rapid and Sustained Antidepressant-Like Effects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						rapastinel; NMDA receptor; depression	MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL PARTIAL AGONIST; MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; SITE PARTIAL AGONIST; METAPLASTICITY PROCESS; NMDA RECEPTORS; KETAMINE; GLYX-13; GLUTAMATE; MECHANISMS	Background: Modulation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors can produce rapid and sustained antidepressant effects. Rapastinel (GLYX-13), initially described as a N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor partial glycine site agonist, exhibits rapid antidepressant effect in rodents without the accompanying dissociative effects of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists. Methods: The relationship between rapastinel's in vitro N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor pharmacology and antidepressant efficacy was determined by brain microdialysis and subsequent pharmacological characterization of therapeutic rapastinel concentrations in N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-specific radioligand displacement, calcium mobilization, and medial prefrontal cortex electrophysiology assays. Results: Brain rapastinel concentrations of 30 to 100 nM were associated with its antidepressant-like efficacy and enhancement of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-dependent neuronal intracellular calcium mobilization. Modulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors by rapastinel was independent of D-serine concentrations, and glycine site antagonists did not block rapastinel's effect. In rat medial prefrontal cortex slices, 100 nM rapastinel increased N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents and enhanced the magnitude of long-term potentiation without any effect on miniature EPSCs or paired-pulse facilitation responses, indicating postsynaptic action of rapastinel. A critical amino acid within the NR2 subunit was identified as necessary for rapastinel's modulatory effect. Conclusion: Rapastinel brain concentrations associated with antidepressant-like activity directly enhance medial prefrontal cortex N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activity and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated synaptic plasticity in vitro. At therapeutic concentrations, rapastinel directly enhances N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activity through a novel site independent of the glycine coagonist site. While both rapastinel and ketamine physically target N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, the 2 molecules have opposing actions on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Modest positive modulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors by rapastinel represents a novel pharmacological approach to promote well-tolerated, rapid, and sustained improvements in mood disorders.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a surface molecule specifically expressed by prostate tumors that has been shown to be a valid target for internal radionuclide therapy in both preclinical and clinical settings. The most common radiotherapeutic agent is the small molecule Lu-177-PSMA-617, which is under clinical evaluation in multiple countries. Nevertheless, its efficacy in causing tumor regression is still suboptimal, even when administered in several cycles per patient, perhaps due to poor pharmacokinetics (PK), which limits uptake by the tumor cells. We postulated that the addition of the Evans blue (EB) moiety to PSMA-617 would improve the PK by extending circulation half-life, which would increase tumor uptake and improve radiotherapeutic efficacy. PSMA-617 was modified by conjugation of a 2-thiol acetate group onto the primary amine and thereafter reacted with a maleimide functional group of an EB derivative, to give EB-PSMA-617. The PK and radiotherapeutic efficacy of Y-90- or Lu-177-EB-PSMA-617 was compared to the clinically used radiopharmaceutical Y-90- or Lu-177- PSMA-617 in PC3-PIP tumor-bearing mice. EB-PSMA-617 retained binding to serum albumin as well as a high internalization rate by tumor cells. Upon injection, metal-labeled EB-PSMA-617 demonstrated an extended blood half-life compared to PSMA-617 and, thereby, prolonged the time window for binding to PSMA. The improved PK of EB-PSMA-617 resulted in significantly higher accumulation in PSMA(+) tumors and highly effective radiotherapeutic efficacy. Remarkably, a single dose of 1.85 MBq of Y-90- or Lu-177-EB-PSMA-617 was sufficient to eradicate established PMSA(+) tumors in mice. No significant body weight loss was observed, suggesting little to no gross toxicity. The construct described here, EB-PSMA-617, may improve the radiotherapeutic efficacy for patients with PSMA-positive tumors by reducing both the amount of activity needed for therapy as well as the frequency of administration, as .compared to PSMA-617.

Here, we analysed parameters obtained in dynamic and static PET images using the novel TSPO ligand [F-18]GE-180 in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and an approach for semi-quantitative assessment of this disease in clinical routine. Seventeen dynamic [F-18]GE-180 PET scans of RRMS patients were evaluated (90 min). A pseudo-reference region (PRR) was defined after identification of the least disease-affected brain area by voxel-based comparison with six healthy controls (HC) and upon exclusion of voxels suspected of being affected in static 60-90 min p.i. images. Standardised uptake value ratios (SUVR) obtained from static images normalised to PRR were correlated to the distribution volume ratios (DVR) derived from dynamic data with Logan reference tissue model. Results: Group comparison with HC revealed white matter and thalamus as most affected regions. Fewest differences were found in grey matter, and normalisation to frontal cortex (FC) yielded the greatest reduction in variability of healthy grey and white matter. Hence, FC corrected for affected voxels was chosen as PRR, leading to time-activity curves of FC which were congruent to HC data (SUV60-90 0.37, U test P = 0.42). SUVR showed a very strong correlation with DVR (Pearson rho > 0.9). Focal MS lesions exhibited a high SUVR (range, 1.3-3.2). Conclusions: This comparison with parameters from dynamic data suggests that SUVR normalised to corrected frontal cortex as PRR is suitable for the quantification of [F-18]GE-180 uptake in lesions and different brain regions of RRMS patients. This efficient diagnostic protocol based on static [F-18]GE-180 PET scans acquired 60-90 min p.i. allows the semi-quantitative assessment of neuroinflammation in RRMS patients in clinical routine.

Methods: A dosimetry estimate was calculated on the basis of time-activity curves derived from serially obtained Lu-177-PSMA-617 scans extrapolated to the physical half-life of Ac-225, assuming instant decay of unstable daughter nuclides. Salvage therapies empirically conducted with 50 (n = 4), 100 (n = 4), 150 (n = 2), and 200 kBq/kg (n = 4) of Ac-225-PSMA-617 were evaluated retrospectively regarding toxicity and treatment response. Eight of 14 patients received further cycles in either 2- or 4-mo intervals with identical or deescalated activities. Results: Dosimetry estimates for 1 MBq of Ac-225-PSMA-617 assuming a relative biologic effectiveness of 5 revealed mean doses of 2.3 Sv for salivary glands, 0.7 Sv for kidneys, and 0.05 Sv for red marrow that are composed of 99.4% alpha, 0.5% beta, and 0.1% photon radiation, respectively. In clinical application, severe xerostomia became the dose-limiting toxicity if treatment activity exceeded 100 kBq/kg per cycle. At 100 kBq/kg, the duration of prostate-specific antigen decline was less than 4 mo, but if therapy was repeated every 2 mo patients experienced additive antitumor effects. Treatment activities of 50 kBq/kg were without toxicity but induced insufficient antitumor response in these high-tumor-burden patients. Remarkable antitumor activity by means of objective radiologic response or tumor marker decline was observed in 9 of 11 evaluable patients. Conclusion: For advanced-stage patients, a treatment activity of 100 kBq/kg of Ac-225-PSMA-617 per cycle repeated every 8 wk presents a reasonable trade-off between toxicity and biochemical response.

Our team has explored the concept of wearable PET imagers which could provide functional brain imaging of freely moving subjects. To test feasibility and determine future considerations for development, we built a rudimentary proof-of-concept prototype (Helmet_PET) and conducted tests in phantoms and four human volunteers. Methods: Twelve Silicon Photomultiplier-based detectors were assembled in a ring with exterior weight support and an interior mechanism that could be adjustably fitted to the head. We conducted brain phantom tests as well as scanned four patients scheduled for diagnostic F(18-)FDG PET/CT imaging. For human subjects the imager was angled such that field of view included basal ganglia and visual cortex to test for typical resting-state pattern. Imaging in two subjects was performed similar to 4hr after PET/CT imaging to simulate lower injected F(18-)FDG dose by taking advantage of the natural radioactive decay of the tracer (F-18 half-life of 110min), with an estimated imaging dosage of 25% of the standard. Results: We found that imaging with a simple lightweight ring of detectors was feasible using a fraction of the standard radioligand dose. Activity levels in the human participants were quantitatively similar to standard PET in a set of anatomical ROIs. Typical resting-state brain pattern activation was demonstrated even in a 1min scan of active head rotation. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of imaging a human subject with a novel wearable PET imager that moves with robust head movements. We discuss potential research and clinical applications that will drive the design of a fully functional device. Designs will need to consider trade-offs between a low weight device with high mobility and a heavier device with greater sensitivity and larger field of view.

We wanted to evaluate the in vivo biodistribution profile and brain uptake of F-18-labeled TCO ([F-18]TCO) to assess its potential for pre-targeted imaging in the brain. Methods: We evaluated the in vivo behavior of[F-18]TCO via an ex vivo biodistribution study complemented by in vivo mu PET imaging at 5, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 240 mm post tracer injection. An in vivo metabolite study was performed at 5 min, 30 mm and 120 min post [F-18]TCO injection by RP-HPLC analysis of plasma and brain extracts. Incubation with human liver microsomes was performed to further evaluate the metabolite profile of the tracer. Results: mu PET imaging and ex-vivo biodistribution revealed an high initial brain uptake of [F-18]TCO (3.8%ID/g at 5 min pi) followed by a washout to 3.0%ID/g at 30 min pi. Subsequently the brain uptake increased again to 3.7%ID/g at 120 min pi followed by a slow washout until 240 min pi (2.9%ID/g). Autoradiography confirmed homogenous brain uptake. On the WET images bone uptake became gradually visible after 120 mm pi and was clearly visible at 240 mm pi. The metabolite study revealed a fast metabolization of [F-18]TCO in plasma and brain into three main polar radiometabolites. Conclusions: Although [F-18]TCO has previously been described to be a useful tracer for radiolabeling of tetrazine modified targeting molecules, our study indicates that its utility for in vivo chemistry and pretargeted imaging will be limited. Although [F-18]TCO clearly enters the brain, it is quickly metabolized with a non-specific accumulation of radioactivity in the brain and bone. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Angiotensin II activates NF-κB through AT<sub>1A</sub> receptor recruitment of β-arrestin in cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-CELL PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						angiotensin receptor; NF-kappa B; beta-arrestins; signal transduction; vascular smooth muscle cells; cyclooxygenase-2	NUCLEAR-LOCALIZATION SEQUENCE; SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION; TYROSINE KINASES; EXPRESSION; PATHWAY; CYCLOOXYGENASE-2; IDENTIFICATION; TRANSCRIPTION; PHOSPHORYLATION; MOLECULE	Activation of the angiotensin type 1A receptor (AT(1A)R) in rat aorta vascular smooth muscle cells (RASMC) results in increased synthesis of the proinflammatory enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). We previously showed that nuclear localization of internalized AT(1A)R results in activation of transcription of the gene for COX-2, i.e., prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase-2. Others have suggested that ANG II stimulation of COX-2 protein synthesis is mediated by NF-kappa B. The purpose of the present study was to examine the interrelationship between AT(1A)R activation, beta-arrestin recruitment, and NF-kappa B activation in the ability of ANG II to increase COX-2 protein synthesis in RASMC. In the present study we utilized RASMC, inhibitors of the NF-kappa B pathway, beta-arrestin knockdown, radioligand binding, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence to characterize the roles of AT(1A)R internalization, NF-kappa B activation, and beta-arrestin in ANG II-induced COX-2 synthesis. Ro-106-9920 or parthenolide, agents that inhibit the initial steps of NF-kappa B activation, blocked ANG II-induced p65 NF-kappa B nuclear localization, COX-2 protein expression, beta-arrestin recruitment, and AT(1A)R internalization without inhibiting ANG II-induced p42/44 ERK activation. Curcumin, an inhibitor of NF-kappa B-induced transcription, blocked ANG II-induced COX-2 protein expression without altering AT(1A)R internalization, ANG II-induced p65 NF-kappa B nuclear localization, or p42/44 ERK activation. Small interfering RNA-induced knockdown of beta-arrestin-1 and -2 inhibited ANG II-induced p65 NF-kappa B nuclear localization. In vascular smooth muscle cells, internalization of the activated AT(1A)R mediated by beta-arrestins activates the NF-kappa B pathway, producing nuclear localization of the transcription factor and initiation of COX-2 protein synthesis, thereby linking internalization of the receptor with the NF-kappa B pathway.

GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor open-state conformation determines non-competitive antagonist binding	TOXICOLOGY AND APPLIED PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Chimeragenesis; GABA(A) receptor; Insecticide; Mutagenesis; Non-competitive antagonist; [H-3]EBOB	AMINOBUTYRIC ACID(A) RECEPTORS; AMINO-ACID; INTERNATIONAL UNION; SUBUNIT COMPOSITION; SURFACE EXPRESSION; CHLORIDE CHANNEL; BETA-3 SUBUNIT; POINT MUTATION; ION CHANNELS; A RECEPTORS	The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptor (GABA(A)R) is one of the most important targets for insecticide action. The human recombinant beta 3 homomer is the best available model for this binding site and 4-n-[H-3]propyl-4'-ethynylbicycloorthobenzoate ([H-3]EBOB) is the preferred non-competitive antagonist (NCA) radioligand. The uniquely high sensitivity of the beta 3 homomer relative to the much-less-active but structurally very-similar beta 1 homomer provides an ideal comparison to elucidate structural and functional features important for NCA binding. The beta 1 and beta 3 subunits were compared using chimeragenesis and mutagenesis and various combinations with the alpha 1 subunit and modulators. Chimera beta 3/beta 1 with the beta 3 subunit extracellular domain and the beta 1 subunit transmembrane helices retained the high [H-3]EBOB binding level of the beta 3 homomer while chimera beta 1/beta 3 with the beta 1 subunit extracellular domain and the beta 3 subunit transmembrane helices had low binding activity similar to the beta 1 homomer. GABA at 3 mu M stimulated heteromers alpha 1 beta 1 and alpha 1 beta 3 binding levels more than 2-fold by increasing the open probability of the channel. Addition of the alpha 1 subunit rescued the inactive beta 1/beta 3 chimera close to wildtype alpha 1 beta 1 activity. EBOB binding was significantly altered by mutations beta 1S15'N and beta 3N15'S compared with wildtype beta 1 and beta 3, respectively. However, the binding activity of alpha 1 beta 1S15'N was insensitive to GABA and alpha 1 beta 3N15'S was stimulated much less than wildtype alpha 1 beta 3 by GABA. The inhibitory effect of etomidate on NCA binding was reduced more than 5-fold by the mutation beta 3N15'S. Therefore, the NCA binding site is tightly regulated by the open-state conformation that largely determines GABA(A) receptor sensitivity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Adults with separation anxiety report extreme anxiety and fear about separations from major attachment figures (partner, children or parents). These symptoms affect individual's behavior, lead to severe impairment in social relationships and are not better accounted for by the presence of agoraphobia. In a previous study we found platelet expression reduction of the 18 kDa Translocator Protein (TSPO) (the new nomenclature for the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor) in patients with panic disorder who also fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for ASAD. Objectives: To explore whether separation anxiety might be a factor differentiating TSPO expression in a sample of patients with major depression. Methods: The equilibrium binding parameters of the specific TSPO ligand [H-3]PK 11195 were estimated on platelet membranes from 40 adult outpatients with DSM-IV diagnosis of MDD, with or without separation anxiety symptoms, and 20 healthy controls. Patients were assessed by SCID-1, HAM-D, the Structured Clinical Interview for Separation Anxiety Symptoms (SCI-SAS-A) and the Adult Separation Anxiety Self-report Checklist (ASA-27). Results: A significant reduction of platelet TSPO density mean value was found in depressed patients with associated ASAD symptoms, while no significant differences were found between depressed patients without ASAD and the control group. Individual TSPO density values were significantly and negatively correlated with both SCI-SAS-A and ASA-27 total scores, but not with HAM-D total score or HAM-D anxiety/somatization factor score. Conclusions: The reduction of platelet TSPO density in our sample of patients with depression was specifically related to the presence of ASAD. These data suggest that TSPO expression evaluation is a useful biological marker of ASAD. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP. All rights reserved.

[<SUP>99m</SUP>Tc]Demotensin 5 and 6 in the NTS1-R-targeted imaging of tumours:: synthesis and preclinical results	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						tetraamine-neurotensin; NTS1-R-targeted imaging; diagnostic tumour imaging	PSEUDOPEPTIDE ANALOGS; NEUROTENSIN RECEPTORS; PEPTIDE RECEPTORS; MESSENGER-RNA; SOMATOSTATIN; EXPRESSION; THERAPY	Purpose The aim of this study was to evaluate the applicability of [Tc-99m] Demotensin 5 and 6 ([Tc-99m - N-4(0), (beta)Ala(7), Dab(9), X-AA(12)]NT(7-13); X-AA = Ile/5, Tle/6, NT = neurotensin) in the targeted diagnostic imaging of neurotensin subtype 1 receptor (NTS1-R)-expressing tumours. Methods Labelling of Demotensin 5 and 6 with Tc-99m was conducted by brief incubation with (TcO4-)-Tc-99m, SnCl2 and citrate anions in alkaline medium at ambient temperature. Affinities of conjugates for the NTS1-R were determined by competition binding experiments in WiDr cell membranes using [I-125-Tyr(3)] NT as the radioligand. Saturation binding assays were conducted for [Tc-99m/Tc-99g] Demotensin 6 in WiDr cell membranes. Internalisation of [Tc-99m] Demotensin 5 and 6 was studied at 37 C in WiDr cells. Biodistribution of [Tc-99m] Demotensin 5 and 6 was performed in female Swiss nu/nu mice bearing human WiDr xenografts. Results Unlabelled conjugates showed a high affinity for the human NTS1-R (Demotensin 5 IC50=0.03 +/- 0.01 nM; Demotensin 6 IC50 = 0.08 +/- 0.02 nM), while high affinity was also exhibited by (radio) metallated [Tc-99m/Tc-99g] Demotensin 6 (K-d = 0.13 +/- 0.01 nM). [Tc-99m] Demotensin 5 and 6 internalised rapidly and specifically in WiDr cells. After injection in WiDr tumour-bearing mice, radiopeptides, and especially the doubly stabilised [Tc-99m] Demotensin 6, showed NTS1-R-mediated uptake in the intestines and in the implanted tumour (4.30 +/- 0.45% ID/g at 1 h post injection) and rapid renal excretion from non-target tissues into the urine. Conclusion [Tc-99m] Demotensin 6 shows a favourable preclinical profile and further testing in patients is warranted to monitor its eventual applicability as a radiotracer in the diagnostic imaging of NTS1-R-positive tumours.

In these mice, plasma ET-1 levels are elevated. Our aim was to use quantitative autoradiography to establish the distribution of ET receptor subtypes in peripheral tissues from wild-type mice and to measure the density of the ETA subtype in ETB-/- knockout animals. Our second aim was to test whether deletion of ETB receptors, which is associated with elevated plasma levels of ET-1, would also reduce ETA expression in the periphery. In longitudinal sections from wild-type mice, the highest densities of ETA receptors localized to major organs including the ventricle of the heart, lung, and liver parenchyma. High densities of ETA receptors were detected in the smooth muscle layer of the vasculature such as intrarenal vessels as well as the smooth muscle layer and epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract. In these tissues, the ETA subtype was more abundant, representing between 60% and 100% of the ET receptors. ETB receptors predominated in the medulla of kidney, with high densities also localizing to glomeruli within the cortex and to the sinusoids from the liver. Lower densities of ETB receptors were also present in the lung, heart, liver, and the smooth muscle layer of the gastrointestinal tract. In ETB-/- knockout mice, ETB receptors were not detected as expected by either ligand binding or immunocytochemistry. The pattern of ETA receptor distribution in the ETB-/- knockout mice was similar to the controls, but the density of ETA receptors was significantly reduced in the lung by 39%. Diminished responses to the endogenous agonist after repeated stimulation are an important feature of G-protein signaling, preventing potential damage to the overstimulated cell, and it is likely that downregulation occurs in response to higher circulating levels of ET-1.

This gene plays a role in regulating neuronal activity-dependent gene expression, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is a potent serotonergic (5-HT) neuronal growth factor. We analyzed selected parameters of the 5-HT system of the medulla in autopsied patients with Rett syndrome because of the role of BDNF in 5-HT cell development and because 5-HT plays a key role in modulating autonomic control. 5-HT neurons were identified by immunostaining for tryptophan hydroxylase, the biosynthetic enzyme for 5-HT. We quantitated the number of 5-HT cells in the medulla at 2 standardized levels in 11 Rett and 7 control cases. There was no significant difference in 5-HT cell number between the groups. We analyzed binding to the serotonin transporter (SERT) using the radioligand [I-125] -RTI-55 with tissue autoradiography in 7 Rett and 5 controls in 9 cardiorespiratory-related nuclei. In the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMX) (preganglionic parasympathetic outflow), SERT binding for the control cases decreased significantly over time (p = 0.049) but did not change in the Rett cases (p = 0.513). Adjusting for age, binding between the Rett and control cases differed significantly in this nucleus (p = 0.022). There was a marginally significant age versus diagnosis interaction (p = 0.06). Thus, altered 5-HT innervation and/or uptake in the DMX may contribute to abnormal 5-HT modulation of this major autonomic nucleus in patients with Rett syndrome. These data suggest hypotheses concerning 5-HT modulation of vagal function for testing in MeCP2 knockout mice to understand mechanisms underlying autonomic dysfunction in patients with Rett syndrome.
