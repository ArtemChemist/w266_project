Methods: Sixty-three patients with a median age of 73 y who underwent 307 cycles of therapy with (RaCl2)-Ra-223 were analyzed. In 31 patients, bone scanning and radiologic imaging were performed for pretherapeutic imaging (group 1). In 32 patients, bone scanning and PSMA PET were performed before therapy (group 2). Patients with small lymph node metastases and local recurrence were not excluded from treatment, consistent with current guidelines. PSA and ALP were measured before each treatment cycle and 4 wk after the final cycle. Thirteen patients from group 2, who underwent a second PSMA PET scan as a follow-up, were evaluated to determine the significance of PSA changes as a follow-up marker. Results: In group 1, 4 patients (12.9%) showed a PSA decline, of whom 2 patients and 1 patient showed a PSA decline of more than 30% and more than 50%, respectively. In contrast, in group 2, 14 patients (43.8%) showed a PSA decline, of whom 10 and 8 patients showed a decline of more than 30% and more than 50%, respectively (P = 0.007). Thirty-seven patients had a high ALP level (19 from group 1 and 18 from group 2). Twelve (63.2%) and 16 (88.9%) patients in groups 1 and 2, respectively, showed an ALP decline. This difference was not significant; however, 7 (36%) and 13 (72.2%) patients in groups 1 and 2, respectively, showed an ALP decline of more than 30% (P = 0.04). Considering any ALP decline as a response, no patient with increasing ALP showed a PSA response (P = 0.036). There was a significant correlation between the PSA changes and the therapeutic response according to follow-up PSMA PET. Conclusion: When PSMA PET is used as the gatekeeper in addition to bone scanning, radionuclide therapy with Ra-223 may be more effective and have more success regarding changes in the PSA. An increase in PSA during therapy cycles occurs because of disease progression.

GABAergic dysfunction in mGlu7 receptor-deficient mice as reflected by decreased levels of glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 and 67 kDa and increased reelin proteins in the hippocampus	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Metabotropic glutamate receptors; GABA; GAD; GABA(B); Reelin	GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC-ACID; MESSENGER-RNA EXPRESSION; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL LOCALIZATION; BIPOLAR DISORDER; DENDRITIC SPINE; SUBCELLULAR-LOCALIZATION; GABA CONCENTRATIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; DOWN-REGULATION	Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, while gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a primary inhibitory neuromodulator. Both amino acids act through ionotropic and metabotropic receptors that are widely distributed in the central nervous system. There are at least eight subtypes of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGlu), which have been divided into three groups (mGlu I, II, and III). The mGlu7 receptor subtype, which belongs to the mGlu III group, seems to play a special role, as it is abundant in brain structures that are known to be responsible for antidepressant and/or anxiolytic activity of drugs. In GABAergic neurons, GABA is synthesised from glutamate by the pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). It is expressed as two major isoforms, GAD65 and GAD67, responsible for the synthesis of the vesicular and cytoplasmic pool of neurotransmitter, respectively. Moreover, GABAergic neurons express a variety of proteins such as reelin, involved in synaptic transmission and plasticity. The aim of our study was to investigate the regulation of GABA synthesis and the level of modulatory receptor for GABA in mice lacking mGlu7 receptor for glutamate. The levels of GAD mRNA, GADs, and reelin proteins in the hippocampi of mGlu7-/- and mGlu7-/+ mice were measured using in situ hybridisation, immunohistochemistry, and Western blotting (WB). GAD mRNAs in the CA and DG regions of the hippocampus were measured separately. The levels of GAD65, GAD67, and reelin proteins were determined in the homogenates using WB, and the number of stained neurons was estimated using a stereological method of counting. GABA(B) receptor level was measured using a radioligand binding assay. Our results show that the mRNA and protein levels of both GADs were decreased in the hippocampi of animals lacking the mGlu7 receptor. Decreased levels of GAD67 mRNA were found in both the CA and DG regions, while the decrease in GAD65 mRNA was observed mainly in the CA region of the hippocampus. The protein levels of GAD65 was lowered in mGlu7-/- animals only, while GAD67 and GABAB receptor number were decreased in both mGlu7+/- and mGlu7-/- mice when measured in the whole hippocampus. In contrast, reelin was shown to be increased both in mGlu7-/+ and mGlu7-/- mice. The results suggest that mGlu7 receptor is involved in the regulation of GABAergic system activity at the level of GABA synthesised enzymes, specific proteins expressed by GABAergic neurons and metabotropic receptor for GABA.

The cannabinoid receptor agonist CP-55,940 and ethyl arachidonate interfere with [<SUP>3</SUP>H]batrachotoxinin A 20 α-benzoate binding to sodium channels and inhibit sodium channel function	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY & PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						CP-55,940; ethyl arachidonate; [(3)H]batrachotoxinin binding; sodium channel; cannabinoid-1 receptors; synaptoneurosomes; membrane potential; mouse brain	ENDOGENOUS CANNABINOIDS; SYNTHETIC CANNABIMIMETICS; PHARMACOLOGICAL ACTIVITY; BRAIN CONSTITUENT; CALCIUM-CHANNELS; MOUSE-BRAIN; RAT-BRAIN; ANANDAMIDE; CELLS; ACID	Recent investigations in our laboratory showed that voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) in brain are sensitive to inhibition by various synthetic cannabinoids and endocannabinoids. The present experiments examined the effects of the cannabinoid-1 (CB1) receptor agonist CP-55,940 and ethyl arachiclonate on [(3)H] batrachotoxinin A 20 a-benzoate ([(3)H]BTX-BI]) binding and VGSC-dependent depolarization of the nerve membrane in synaptoneurosomes isolated from mouse whole brain. CP-55,940 acted as a full inhibitor of [(3)H]BTX-B binding and its IC(50) was established at 22.3 mu M. At its maximum effect concentration, ethyl arachiclonate achieved partial (approximately 70%) inhibition and was less effective than CP-55,940 as an inhibitor of binding (IC(50)=262.7 mu M). The potent CB1 receptor antagonist AM251 (2 mu M) had no significant effect on the displacement of [3H]BTX-B by either compound (P > 0.05). Scatchard analyses showed that CP-55,940 and ethyl arachiclonate reduce the binding of [(3)H]BTX-B by lowering its B(max) but ethyl arachidonate also increased the K(d) of radioligand binding. In kinetic experiments, CP-55,940 and ethyl arachiclonate were found to boost the dissociation of [3H]BTX-B from VGSCs to rates that exceed the maximum velocity achievable by veratridine, indicating they operate as allosteric inhibitors of [3H]BTX-B binding. Neither compound was effective at changing the initial rate of association of [(3)H]BTX-B with sodium channels. CP-55,940 and ethyl arachiclonate inhibited veratridine-dependent (TTX-suppressible) depolarization of the plasma membrane of synaptoneurosomes with IC(50)s of 3.2 and 50.1 mu M respectively. These inhibitory effects were again not influenced by 2 mu M AM251. Our data demonstrate that the potent cannabinoid receptor agonist CP-55.940 and the ethyl ester of arachidonic acid have the ability to associate with VGSCs and inhibit their function independently of effects on CB1 receptors. Binding data comparisons using mouse brain preparations indicate CP-55,940 is approximately 10,000 times more potent as a CB1 receptor ligand than a sodium channel ligand while ethyl arachiclonate shows a much smaller differential. Ethyl arachiclonate has been shown previously to be the principal metabolite of ethanol in the brains of intoxicated individuals and effects of this ester on VGSCS and CBI receptors may contribute to the depressant effects of alcohol.

To investigate the role of regulation of V2R in water and sodium homeostasis, we have developed a method for small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated inhibition of V2R expression in vivo. Three 21-nt siRNA sequences were chosen that specifically targeted the mouse V2R but shared no appreciable sequence homology to any other known mouse genes, including the vasopressin V-1a and V-1b receptors. Additionally, an siRNA sequence that shared no significant matches to any known mammalian gene sequences was chosen for use as a control. Chemically synthesized siRNA was complexed with the liposomal transfection reagent DOTAP. Each mouse (male C57BL/6) received 3.6 nmol (similar to 50 mu g) of either the control (nonsilencing) or one of the V2R-targeting siRNAs via intravenous injection. Forty-eight hours after injection membranes were prepared from the inner medulla of the kidneys, and V2R expression was measured by a radioligand binding assay and Western immunoblotting. Treatment with one of the V2R-targeting siRNAs (R2) caused a 39.7 +/- 8.7% reduction in V2R-specific binding compared with the control (n = 11, P < 0.05) and a 37.0 +/- 2.3% reduction in V2R protein expression as measured by Western immunoblotting (n = 4, P < 0.001). Additionally, real-time PCR revealed that R2 siRNA treatment induced a 68.8 +/- 2.2% reduction in V2R mRNA. However, this siRNA treatment did not alter the animals' basal urine concentrating capacity under unstimulated conditions. In subsequent experiments, treatment with R2 siRNA was found to significantly attenuate the antidiuretic effects the V2R-specific AVP agonist 1-desamino[8-D-arginine]vasopressin (dDAVP). Mice were infused with dDAVP (0.25 ng/h) for 3 days to produce maximal antidiuresis and then were injected with either the R2 siRNA or the nonsilencing control. On day 2 after treatment, urine osmolality was significantly decreased from 3,455 +/- 72 in control animals ( n = 12) to 3,155 +/- 129 mosmol/kgH(2)O in R2 siRNA-treated animals ( n = 12) ( P < 0.05); similarly, on day 2 24-h urine volume was significantly increased from 0.86 +/- 0.07 ml/day to 1.11 +/- 0.06 ml/day in R2 siRNA-treated animals ( P < 0.05). In summary we have demonstrated that RNA interference methodology can be used successfully in vivo to significantly reduce functional expression of the V2R in the mouse kidney.

AlphaBet: Combination of Radium-223 and [<SUP>17</SUP><SUP>7</SUP>Lu]Lu-PSMA-I&T in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (clinical trial protocol)	FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer; alpha therapy; micrometastatic disease; Lu-177-PSMA; radium-223; PSMA	ALKALINE-PHOSPHATASE; BONE METASTASES; IMMUNOTHERAPY; DOCETAXEL; THERAPY	Background [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA is a radioligand therapy used in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Despite a survival benefit, the responses for many patients receiving [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA are not durable, and all patients eventually develop progressive disease. The bone marrow is the most common site of progression. Micrometastases in this area likely receive an inadequate dose of radiation, as the emitted beta-particles from Lu-177 travel an average range of 0.7 mm in soft tissue, well beyond the diameter of micrometastases. Radium-223 (Ra-223) is a calcium-mimetic and alpha-emitting radionuclide approved for use in men with mCRPC with bone metastases. The range of emitted alpha particles in soft tissue is much shorter (& LE;100 mu m) with high linear energy transfer, likely more lethal for osseous micrometastases. We anticipate that combining a bone-specific alpha-emitter with [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA will improve eradication of micrometastatic osseous disease, and thereby lead to higher and longer responses. Methods This is a single-center, single-arm phase I/II trial evaluating the combination of Ra-223 and [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-I & T in men with mCRPC. Thirty-six patients will receive 7.4 GBq of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-I & T, concurrently with Ra-223 in escalating doses (28 kBq/kg - 55kBq/kg), both given intravenously every six weeks for up to six cycles. Eligible patients will have at least two untreated bone metastases visible on bone scintigraphy, and PSMA-positive disease on PSMA PET scan. Patients must have adequate bone marrow and organ function and be willing to undergo tumor biopsies. Patients with discordant disease visible on FDG PET scan (defined as FDG positive disease with minimal or no PSMA expression and no uptake on bone scan) will be excluded. Other key exclusion criteria include the presence of diffuse marrow disease, prior treatment with Ra-223 or [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA, or more than one prior line of chemotherapy for prostate cancer. The co-primary objectives of this study are to determine the maximum tolerated dose of Ra-223 when combined with [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-I & T and the 50% PSA response rate. Conclusion The AlphaBet trial is a phase I/II study combining Ra-223 with [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-I & T in patients with mCRPC. We aim to enroll the first patient in Q3 2022, and recruitment is anticipated to continue for 24 months.

We determined its radiation dosimetry and relationships to pretherapeutic imaging and outcomes. Methods: Thirty patients with prostate cancer receiving Lu-177-PSMA-617 within a prospective clinical trial (ACTRN12615000912583) were studied. Screening Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT demonstrated high PSMA expression in all patients. After therapy, patients underwent quantitative SPECT/CT at 4, 24, and 96 h. Pharmacokinetic uptake and clearance at a voxel level were calculated and translated into absorbed dose using voxel S values. Volumes of interest were drawn on normal tissues and tumor to assess radiation dose, and a whole-body tumor dose was defined. Correlations between PSMA PET/CT parameters, dosimetry, and biochemical and therapeutic response were analyzed to identify relationships between absorbed dose, tumor burden, and patient physiology. Results: Mean absorbed dose to kidneys, submandibular and parotid glands, liver, spleen, and bone marrow was 0.39, 0.44, 0.58, 0.1, 0.06, and 0.11 Gy/MBq, respectively. Median whole-body tumor-absorbed dose was 11.55 Gy and correlated with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response at 12 wk. A median dose of 14.1 Gy was observed in patients achieving a PSA decline of at least 50%, versus 9.6 Gy for those achieving a PSA decline of less than 50% (P < 0.01). Of 11 patients receiving a tumor dose of less than 10 Gy, only one achieved a PSA response of at least 50%. On screening PSMA PET, whole-body tumor SUVmean correlated with mean absorbed dose (r = 0.62), and SUVmax of the parotids correlated with absorbed dose (r = 0.67). There was an inverse correlation between tumor volume and mean dose to the parotids (r = -0.41) and kidneys (r = -0.43). The mean parotid dose was also reduced with increasing body mass (r = -0.41) and body surface area (r = -0.37). Conclusion: Lu-177-PSMA-617 delivers high absorbed doses to tumor, with a significant correlation between whole-body tumor dose and PSA response. Patients receiving less than 10 Gy were unlikely to achieve a fall in PSA of at least 50%. Significant correlations between aspects of screening Ga-68-PET/CT and tumor and normal tissue dose were observed, providing a rationale for patient-specific dosing. Reduced salivary and kidney doses were observed in patients with a higher tumor burden. The parotid dose also reduced with increasing body mass and body surface area.

Test-Retest Reproducibility for the Tau PET Imaging Agent Flortaucipir F 18	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						flortaucipir; AV-1451; tau imaging; Alzheimer's disease; reliability	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; PAIRED HELICAL FILAMENTS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; MOUSE MODEL; AMYLOID PET; PATHOLOGY; BRAIN; BETA; RADIOLIGAND	Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by beta-amyloid (A beta) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles. There are several PET imaging biomarkers for A beta including C-11-PiB and F-18-florbetapir. Recently, PET tracers for tau neurofibrillary tangles have become available and have shown utility in detection and monitoring of neurofibrillary pathology over time. Flortaucipir F 18 is one such tracer. Initial clinical studies indicated greater tau binding in AD and mild cognitive impairment patients than in controls in a pattern consistent with tau pathology observed at autopsy. However, little is known about the reproducibility of such findings. To our knowledge, this study reports the first data regarding test-retest reproducibility of flor-taucipir F 18 PET. Methods: Twenty-one subjects who completed the study (5 healthy controls, 6 mild cognitive impairment, and 10 AD) received 370 MBq of flortaucipir F 18 and were imaged for 20 min beginning 80 min after injection and again at 110 min after injection. Follow-up (retest) imaging occurred between 48 h and 4 wk after initial imaging. Images were spatially normalized to Montreal Neurological Institute template space. SUVRs were calculated using AAL (Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas) volumes of interest (VOIs) for parietal, temporal, occipital, anterior, and posterior hippocampal, parahippocampal, and fusiform regions, as well as a posterior neocortical VOI composed of average values from parietal, temporal, and occipital areas. Further, a VOI derived by discriminant analysis that maximally separated diagnostic groups (multiblock barycentric discriminant analysis [MUBADA]) was used. All VOIs were referenced to a subsection of cerebellar gray matter (cere-crus) as well as a parametrically derived white matter-based reference region (parametric estimate of reference signal intensity [PERSI]). t test, correlation analyses, and intraclass correlation coefficient were used to explore test-retest performance. Results: Test-retest analyses demonstrated low variability in flortaucipir F 18 SUVR. The SD of mean percentage change between test and retest using the PERSI reference region was 2.22% for a large posterior neocortical VOI, 1.84% for MUBADA, 1.46% for frontal, 1.98% for temporal, 2.28% for parietal, and 3.27% for occipital VOIs. Further, significant correlations (R-2 > 0.85; P < 0.001) were observed for all regions, and intraclass correlation coefficient values (test-retest consistency) were greater than 0.92 for all regions. Conclusion: Significant test-retest reproducibility for flortaucipir F 18 was found across neocortical and mesial temporal lobe structures. These preliminary data suggest that flortaucipir F 18 tau imaging could be used to examine changes in tau burden over time.

In addition to HLA, a second susceptibility locus for IDDM has been identified to lie in the major histocompatibility class III region. MIC-A is located in the MHC class III region and is expressed by monocytes, keratinocytes, and endothelial cells. Sequence determination of the MIC-A gene identifies trinucleotide repeat (GCT) microsatellite polymorphism in exon 5. Five alleles with 4, 5, 6, and 9 repetitions of GCT or 5 repetitions of GCT with 1 additional nucleotide insertion (GGCT) are identified. The alleles are A4, A5, A5.1, A6, and A9. The aim of our study was to find the association of MIC-A alleles with IDDM, malnutrition-modulated diabetes mellitus (MMDM), and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients. IDDM (n = 52), MMDM (n = 41), NIDDM (n = 212), and healthy controls (n = 73) from Cuttack, in eastern India, were studied. Of the 212 NIDDM patients analyzed, 96 of them were found to he positive for either GAD65 or IA-2 antibodies. Autoantibodies to GAD65 and IA-2 were measured by radioligand binding assay using S-35-labeled recombinant human GAD65 and IA-2 in an in vitro transcription/translation system. Autoantibody-positive NIDDM patients (n = 96) and adult healthy controls for NIDDM (n = 113) were also compared. These autoantibody-positive NIDDM patients are considered as slow-onset IDDM or latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) patients. The samples were analyzed for MIC-A by PCR amplification, and fragment sizes were determined in an ABI prism DNA sequencer. The results of the MIC-A typing are: allele 9 of MIC-A is positively associated (OR 3.62; P < 0.001), and allele 4 is negatively associated (OR 0.31; P < 0.05) with MMDM patients compared to controls. Allele 5 is positively associated with IDDM (OR 2.64; P < 0.05) when compared to controls. Allele 5.1 is positively associated in the autoantibody-positive NIDDM patients compared to adult controls. Our findings of a significant increase of allele A9 in MMDM patients compared to healthy controls suggest that MMDM is immunogenetically different from IDDM in eastern India. MIC-A is important in the pathogenesis of MMDM patients from Cuttack. MIC-A alleles distinguish acute-onset IDDM from slow-onset IDDM, indicating that this molecule may be important for delaying the onset of IDDM with the result that these patients are diagnosed clinically as NIDDM.

Synthesis and Evaluation of <SUP>18</SUP>F-Enzalutamide, a New Radioligand for PET Imaging of Androgen Receptors: A Comparison with 16β-<SUP>18</SUP>F-Fluoro-5α-Dihydrotestosterone	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						prostate cancer; PET imaging; androgen receptors; enzalutamide; mice	RESISTANT PROSTATE-CANCER; ANTAGONISTS	16 beta-F-18-fluoro-5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (F-18-FDHT) is a radiopharmaceutical that has been investigated as a diagnostic agent for the assessment of androgen receptor (AR) density in prostate cancer using PET. However, F-18-FDHT is rapidly metabolized in humans and excreted via the kidneys into the urine, potentially compromising the detection of tumor lesions close to the prostate. Enzalutamide is an AR signaling inhibitor currently used in different stages of prostate cancer. Enzalutamide and its primary metabolite N-desmethylenzalutamide have an AR affinity comparable to that of FDHT but are excreted mainly via the hepatic route. Radiolabeled enzalutamide could thus be a suitable candidate PET tracer for AR imaging. Here, we describe the radiolabeling of enzalutamide with F-18. Moreover, the in vitro and in vivo behavior of F-18-enzalutamide was evaluated and compared with the current standard, F-18-FDHT. Methods: F-18-enzalutamide was obtained by fluorination of the nitro precursor. In vitro cellular uptake studies with F-18-enzalutamide and F-18-FDHT were performed in LNCaP (AR-positive) and HEK293 (AR-negative) cells. Competition assays with both tracers were conducted on the LNCaP (AR-positive) cell line. In vivo PET imaging, ex vivo biodistribution, and metabolite studies with F-18-enzalutamide and F-18-FDHT were conducted on athymic nude male mice bearing an LNCaP xenograft in the shoulder. Results: F-18-enzalutamide was obtained in 1.4% +/- 0.9% radiochemical yield with an apparent molar activity of 6.2 +/- 10.3 GBq/mu mol. F-18-FDHT was obtained in 1.5% +/- 0.8% yield with a molar activity of more than 25 GBq/mu mol. Coincubation with an excess of 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone or enzalutamide significantly reduced the cellular uptake of F-18-enzalutamide and F-18-FDHT to about 50% in AR-positive LNCaP cells but not in AR-negative HEK293 cells. PET and biodistribution studies on male mice bearing a LnCaP xenograft showed about 3 times higher tumor uptake for F-18-enzalutamide than for F-18-FDHT. Sixty minutes after tracer injection, 93% of F-18-enzalutamide in plasma was still intact, compared with only 3% of F-18-FDHT. Conclusion: Despite its lower apparent molar activity, F-18-enzalutamide shows higher tumor uptake and better metabolic stability than F-18-FDHT and thus seems to have more favorable properties for imaging of AR with PET. However, further evaluation in other oncologic animal models and patients is warranted to confirm these results.	[Antunes, Ines F.; van Waarde, Aren; Dierckx, Rudi A. J.

Therefore, the inhibition of the adrenergic nervous system seems to be a reasonable and appropriate therapeutic approach for the treatment of metabolic disturbances. It has been suggested that non-selective adrenoceptor antagonists could be particularly beneficial, since alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists can improve disrupted lipid and carbohydrate profiles, while the inhibition of the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor may contribute to body weight reduction. The aim of the present study was to investigate the metabolic benefits deriving from administration of a non-selective alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist from the group of pyrrolidin-2-one derivatives. The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential metabolic benefits deriving from chronic administration of a non-selective alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, from the group of pyrrolidin-2-one derivatives. Methods The alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-adrenoreceptor affinities of the tested compound-1-(3-(4-(o-tolyl) piperazin-1-yl)propyl)pyrrolidin-2-one had been investigated previously by means of the radioligand binding assay. In the present study, we extended the pharmacological profile characteristics of the selected molecule by additional intrinistic activity assays. Next, we investigated the influence of the tested compound on body weight, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, blood pressure in the animal model of obesity induced by a high-fat diet, and additionally we measured the spontaneous activity and body temperature. Results The intrinistic activity studies revealed that the tested compound is a potent, non-selective antagonist of alpha(1B) and alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors. After the chronic administration of the tested compound, we observed reduced level of triglycerides and glucose in the rat plasma. Interestingly, the tested did not reduce the body weight and did not influence the blood pressure in normotensive animals. Additionally, the administration of the tested compound did not change the animals' spontaneous activity and body temperature. Conclusion Non-selective alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist seems to carry potential benefits in the improvement of the reduction of elevated glucose and triglyceride level. The lack of influence on blood pressure suggests that compounds with such a pharmacological profile may be particulary beneficial for the patients with disturbed lipid and carbohydrate profile, who do not suffer from hypertension. These results are particulary valuable, since currently there are no safe alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor antagonist drugs available in clinical use with the ability to modulate hyperglycemia that would not affect blood pressure.

The aims of the present study were the following: (a) to assess whether in-vivo protein concentration, as measured by [C-11]befloxatone total distribution volume (V-T), is correlated with post-mortem mRNA expression; (b) to replicate in a population of tobacco smokers the results of a recent study on healthy nonsmokers, which showed that spectral analysis (SA) provides a highly accurate estimation of [C-11]befloxatone-V-T at the voxel level; and (c) to validate the use of an input function that would not require arterial sampling.Materials and methodsHealthy male nonsmokers (n=7) and smokers (n=8) were imaged with PET and [C-11]befloxatone. Binding was quantified at the regional and voxel level with the Logan plot, multilinear analysis (MA1), and SA. V-T values were compared with the reference values obtained by 2TCM at the regional level. [C-11]Befloxatone binding was compared with mRNA transcription maps from the Allen Human Brain Atlas. A less-invasive input function was obtained with a population-based input function (PBIF) scaled with arterialized venous samples.ResultsmRNA expression was highly correlated with in-vivo 2TCM-V-T values both for nonsmokers (R-2=0.873; P<0.0001) and for smokers (R-2=0.851; P<0.0001). At the regional level, both Logan and MA1 showed a moderate negative bias (-5 to -10%) compared with the reference V-T values. With the exception of a single outlying individual, SA showed little bias and variability (+4.43.5%). Although variability was higher than at the regional level, SA provided the most accurate V-T estimations at the voxel level: all but one participant had an error of less than 20%. Parametric Logan and MA1 analyses gave highly biased or unusable results. PBIF provided good results in all participants in whom the arterialization of venous blood was successful (all errors of about 10% or less).Conclusion[C-11]Befloxatone binding is strongly correlated with the values of mRNA transcription measured in post-mortem brains. At the voxel level, SA is the best available choice for [C-11]befloxatone quantification, although a higher variability must be expected. When an arterial input function is not technically feasible, a PBIF scaled with arterialized venous samples may provide an acceptable alternative, provided an optimal arterialization can be achieved.

Thus, the functional imaging of 5-HT1A receptors by positron emission tomography (PET) may contribute to the understanding of its role in those pathologies and their therapeutics. These receptors exist in high- and low-affinity states and it is proposed that agonists bind preferentially to the high-affinity state of the receptor and therefore could provide a measure of the functional 5-HT1A receptors. Since all clinical PET 5-HT1A radiopharmaceuticals are antagonists, it is of great interest to develop a F-18 labelled agonist. F15599 (3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl-(4-fluoro-4{[(5-methyl-pyrimidin-2-ylmethyl)-amino]-methyl}-piperidin-1-yl)-methanone) is a novel ligand with high affinity and selectivity for 5-HT1A receptors and is currently tested as an antidepressant. In pharmacological tests in rat, it exhibits preferential agonist activity at post-synaptic 5-HT1A receptors in cortical brain regions. Here, its nitro-precursor was synthesised and radiolabelled via a fluoronucleophilic substitution. Radiopharmacological evaluations included in vitro and ex vivo autoradiography in rat brain and PET scans on rats and cats. Results were compared with simultaneous studies using [F-18]MPPF, a validated 5-HT1A antagonist radiopharmaceutical. The chemical and radiochemical purities of [F-18]F15599 were > 98%. In vitro [F-18]F15599 binding was consistent with the known 5-HT1A receptors distribution (hippocampus, dorsal raphe nucleus, and notably cortical areas) and addition of Gpp(NH)p inhibited [F-18]F15599 binding, consistent with a specific binding to G protein-coupled receptors. In vitro binding of [F-18]F15599 was blocked by WAY100635 and 8-OH-DPAT, respectively, prototypical 5-HT1A antagonist and agonist. The ex vivo and in vivo studies demonstrated that the radiotracer readily entered the rat and the cat brain and generated few brain radioactive metabolites. Remarkably, in microPET studies, [F-18]F15599 notably displayed a pattern of brain labelling that did not correlate with in vitro observations. Thus, in cat, the highest binding was observed in dorsal raphe and cingulate cortex with little binding in other cortical regions and none in hippocampus. In vivo binding was abolished by WAY100635, indicating specific labelling of 5-HT1A receptors. [F-18]F15599 is a radiofluorinated agonist presenting interesting characteristics for probing in vitro and in vivo the high-affinity states of the 5-HT1A receptors. Its differential labelling of 5-HT1A receptors in vitro and in vivo may result from its reported preferential interaction with receptors coupled to specific G-protein subtypes.

Our main objective was to investigate changes in responsiveness to IL-6 and/or androgen that occur in LNCaP cells after long-term treatment with IL-6. This in vitro model could be of clinical relevance because of its similarity with late-stage prostate carcinoma. Experimental Design: LNCaP human prostate cancer cells were treated with IL-6 at a concentration of 5 ng/ml. After 20 passages, the new subline LNCaP-IL-6+ has been established. Passages 20-40 are referred to as low passages (LP) and passages 41-73 as high passages (HP). LNCaP cells passaged at the same time in the absence of IL-6 were used as controls (LNCaP-IL-6-). Cells were counted after treatment with either IL-6 or the synthetic androgen methyltrienolone (R1881), and cell cycle analysis was performed. Binding of IL-6 or R1881 was assessed by radioligand binding assays. Reporter gene activity was measured by chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay. Prostate-specific antigen in LNCaP-IL-6+ supernatants was measured by an enzyme immunoassay. Expression of IL-6 mRNA and protein was assessed by reverse transcription-PCR and ELISA, respectively. Results: The basal proliferation rate in HP LNCaP-IL-6+ cells was higher than that in LNCaP-IL-6- cells. IL-6 inhibited proliferation of LNCaP-IL-6- cells but not that of either LP or HP of LNCaP-IL-6+ cells. This inability to elicit a growth-inhibitory response was associated with lack of effect on cell cycle distribution in the LNCaP-IL-6+ subline. In parallel, IL-6 binding decreased gradually during long-term IL-6 treatment and, in HP, reached only 33% of the levels measured in controls. Binding of radiolabeled androgen increased 2-fold in HP LNCaP-IL-6+ cells. Reporter gene assays revealed that R1881, at nanomolar concentrations, was a more potent androgen receptor activator in LNCaP-IL-6+ than in LNCaP-IL-6- cells. However, androgen- and IL-6-induced prostate-specific antigen secretion decreased in long-term IL-6-treated cells. IL-6 cDNA fragments were detected by reverse transcription-PCR in HP LNCaP-IL-6+ cells but not in controls or LP. IL-6 protein was first detected in passage 36 of LNCaP-IL-6+ cells, and it increased in HP. Conclusions: Long-term treatment of LNCaP human prostate cancer cells with IL-6 leads to abolishment of inhibitory growth response. In contrast to control cells, the LNCaP-IL-6+ subline expresses IL-6 mRNA and protein.

However, compounds with meta-Cl substitutions had effects more similar to those of cocaine. Objectives: A series of phenyl-ring analogs of benztropine (BZT) substituted with 3'-, 4'-, 3',4 "- and 4',4 " -position CI-groups were synthesized and their pharmacology was evaluated in order to assess more fully the contributions to pharmacological activity of substituents in these positions. Methods: Compounds were synthesized and their pharmacological activity was assessed by examining radioligand binding and behavioral techniques. Results: All of the compounds displaced [H-3]WIN 35,428 binding with affinities ranging from 20 to 32.5 nM. Affinities at norepinephrine ([H-3]nisoxetine) and serotonin ([H-3]citalopram) transporters, respectively ranged from 259 to 5120 and 451 to 2980 nM. Each of the compounds also inhibited [H-3]pirenzepine binding to muscarinic M-1 receptors, with affinities ranging from 0.98 to 47.9 nM. Cocaine and the BZT analogs produced dose-related increases in locomotor activity in mice. However, maximal effects of the BZT analogs were uniformly less than those produced by cocaine, and were obtained 2-3 h after injection compared to the relatively rapid onset (within 30 min) of cocaine effects. In rats trained to discriminate IP saline from 29 mu mol/kg cocaine (10 mg/kg), cocaine produced a dose-related increase in responding on the cocaine lever, reaching 100% at the training dose; however, none of the BZT analogs fully substituted for cocaine, with maximum cocaine responding from 20 to 69%. Despite their reduced efficacy compared to cocaine in cocaine discrimination, none of the analogs antagonized the effects of cocaine. As has been reported previously for 4'-Cl-BZT, the cocaine discriminative-stimulus effects were shifted leftward by co-administration of the present BZT analogs. Conclusions: The present results indicate that although the BZT analogs bind with relatively high affinity and selectivity at the dopamine transporter, their behavioral profile is distinct from that of cocaine. The present results suggest that analogs of BZT may be useful as treatments for cocaine abuse in situations in which an agonist treatment is indicated. These compounds possess features such as reduced efficacy compared to cocaine and a long duration of action that may render them particularly useful leads for the development of therapeutics for cocaine abusers.

Thirteen new compounds have been evaluated for their potencies and efficacies as beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonists on human beta(3)- adrenoceptor expressed in COS-7 and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using radioligand binding assay and cyclic AMP (cAMP) accumulation assay. Phenoxypropanolamine derivatives, SWR-0334NA (([E)-[4-[5-[(3-phenoxy-2-hydroxypropyl)aminol-2-pentene-3-yl] phenoxy]acetic acid sodium salt), SWR-0335SA ((E)-[4-15-[(3-phenoxy-2-hydroxypropyl)amino]-2-pentene-3-yiI phenoxyl acetic acid ethanedioic acid), SWR-0342SA (S-(Z)-[4-[[1-12-[(2-hydroxy-3-phenoxypropyl)laminolethyll-1 -propenyl]phenoxyl acetic acid ethanedioic acid), SWR-0348SA-SITA ((E)-[4-[5-[(3-phenoxy-2-hydroxypropyl)aminol-2-hexene-3-yl] phenoxy]acetic acid ethanedioic acid) and SWR-0361SA ((E)-N-methyl[4-[S-[(3-phenoxy-2-hydroxypropyl)amino]-2-pentene-3-yl]phenoxy]acetoamide ethanedioic acid) showed higher agonistic activity for the A-adrenoceptor. Among the compounds tested, SWR0334NA exhibited full agonistactivity (%E-max 100.26) despite its lower binding affinity (pK(1) = 6.11). Compounds SWR-0338SA ((E)-[4-[5-[(2-phenyl-2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-pentene-3-yl] phenoxylacetic acid ethanedioic acid), SWR-0339SA (5-(E)-[4-[5-[(3-phenoxy-2-hydroxypropyl)aminol-2-pentene-3-yl] phenoxyl acetic acid ethanedioic acid), SWR-0345HA ((E)-2-methyl-3-[4-[2-(2-phenyl-2-hydroxyethylamino)ethoxy) phenyl]-2-propenoic acid ethyl ester hydrochloride), SWR-0358SA ((E)-(2-methoxy-ethyl)-[4-[5-[(3-phenoxy-2-hydroxypropyl) aminol-2-pentene-3-yl]phenoxy]acetoamide ethanedioic acid) and SWR-0362SA ((E)-1-[[[4-[5-[(3-phenoxy-2-hydroxypropyl)aminol-2-pentene -3-yllphenox]-acetyl]carbonyl]piperidine ethanedioic acid) had moderate agonistic activity and were phenethylamine and phenoxypropanolamine derivatives. Compounds SWR-0065HA ([4-[2-[3-[[(3,4-dihydro4-oxo-[ 1,2,4] -triazino(4,5-a) indol)-lyl]oxy]-2-hydroxypropylamino]ethoxy]phenyl]acetic acid methyl ester hydrochloride), SWR-0098NA ((E)-[4-[3-[(2-phenyl-2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-1-butenyl] phenoxylacetic acid sodium salt) and SWR-0302HA ([4-[[4-[2-(3-chlorophenoxy-2-hydroxypropyl)amino]-E-2-buteny]oxy]phenoxy]acetic acid hydrochloride) had very low binding affinity towards beta(3)-adrenoceptors and they did not induce cAMP accumulation. We concluded that compounds SWR-0334NA, SWR-0335SA, SWR-0342SA, SWR-0348SA-SITA and SWR-0361 SA were potential agonists of human beta(3)-adrenoceptor. Further investigation on their selectivity towards beta(3)-adrenoceptor could be useful for the exploration of the physiological properties of the beta(3)-adrenoceptor.

Imaging of these transporters has shown promise as a clinical tool to detect degeneration of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway. Several "presynaptic parkinsonian" syndromes, such as Parkinson's disease or multiple system atrophy, are characterised by degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway. [I-123]FP-CIT SPET imaging studies have shown the ability to detect loss of striatal dopamine transporters in such syndromes. However, in clinical practice it is sometimes difficult, but important, to discriminate patients with "presynaptic parkinsonism" from those with other forms of parkinsonism not characterised by loss of presynaptic dopaminergic cells (e.g. psychogenic parkinsonism or drug-induced postsynaptic parkinsonism). In these inconclusive cases, it may be of value to confirm or exclude the existence of degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic cells by using imaging techniques such as [I-123]FP-CIT SPET. Using [I-123]FP-CIT SPET, we have imaged the striatal dopamine transporters in a group of patients with inconclusive forms of parkinsonism, and, moreover, have been able to perform clinical follow-up of these patients 2-4 years after imaging. In 33 inconclusive cases, ratios of specific to non-specific binding were calculated for the caudate nucleus and putamen following [I-123]FP-CIT SPET imaging and compared with ratios obtained in healthy controls. In nine of the patients, degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway was found scintigraphically and in all these cases, presynaptic parkinsonism was confirmed by clinical follow-up, In the other 24 subjects no degeneration was found scintigraphically, Forms of parkinsonism other than the presynaptic were confirmed at follow-up in 19 cases, and in three cases no conclusive diagnosis was established, but presynaptic parkinsonism was excluded clinically. A clinical diagnosis of presynaptic parkinsonism was established in two cases: one case of multiple system atrophy tin this patient loss of dopamine D-2 receptors was found with [I-123]iodobenzamide SPET performed 2 weeks after [I-123]FP-CIT imaging) and one case of Parkinson's disease. Our data suggest that the positive predictive value of [I-123]FP-CIT imaging is very high, and although the negative predictive value is lower, dopamine transporter imaging offers the prospect of a quick, objective method to confirm or exclude presynaptic parkinsonism in inconclusive cases.

The human vasoactive neuropeptide urotensin II (hUII), which shares structural analogies with somatostatin, interacts with a single high affinity GPCR named UT. High expression of UT has been reported in several types of human solid tumours from lung, gut, prostate, or breast, suggesting that UT is a valuable novel target to design radiolabelled hUII analogues for cancer diagnosis. In this study, two original urotensinergic analogues were first conjugated to a DOTA chelator via an aminohexanoic acid (Ahx) hydrocarbon linker and then -hUII and DOTA-urantide, complexed to the radioactive metal indium isotope to successfully lead to radiolabelled DOTA-Ahx-hUII and DOTA-Ahx-urantide. The In-111-DOTA-hUII in human plasma revealed that only 30% of the radioligand was degraded after a 3-h period. DOTA-hUII and DOTA-urantide exhibited similar binding affinities as native peptides and relayed calcium mobilization in HEK293 cells expressing recombinant human UT. DOTA-hUII, not DOTA-urantide, was able to promote UT internalization in UT-expressing HEK293 cells, thus indicating that radiolabelled In-111-DOTA-hUII would allow sufficient retention of radioactivity within tumour cells or radiolabelled DOTA-urantide may lead to a persistent binding on UT at the plasma membrane. The potential of these radioligands as candidates to target UT was investigated in adenocarcinoma. We showed that hUII stimulated the migration and proliferation of both human lung A549 and colorectal DLD-1 adenocarcinoma cell lines endogenously expressing UT. In vivo intravenous injection of In-111-DOTA-hUII in C57BL/6 mice revealed modest organ signals, with important retention in kidney. In-111-DOTA-hUII or In-111-DOTA-urantide were also injected in nude mice bearing heterotopic xenografts of lung A549 cells or colorectal DLD-1 cells both expressing UT. The observed significant renal uptake and low tumour/muscle ratio (around 2.5) suggest fast tracer clearance from the organism. Together, DOTA-hUII and DOTA-urantide were successfully radiolabelled with (111)Indium, the first one functioning as a UT agonist and the second one as a UT-biased ligand/antagonist. To allow tumour-specific targeting and prolong body distribution in preclinical models bearing some solid tumours, these radiolabelled urotensinergic analogues should be optimized for being used as potential molecular tools for diagnosis imaging or even treatment tools.

Phenoxypropanolamine derivatives SWR-0315NA and SWR-0342SA showed higher binding affinities for beta-adrenoceptor subtypes; SWR-0065HA, however, showed a higher affinity for only beta(2)-adrenoceptors, accounting for 3-fold and 6-fold selectivity against beta(1)- and beta(3)-adrenoceptors. Compounds SWR-0315NA and SWR-0342SA did not show any binding selectivity for any of the subtypes. However, functionally these two compounds are selective for beta(3)-adrenoceptors. Among the phenylethanolamine derivatives, SWR-0338SA and SWR-0345RA showed 9-fold and 16-fold higher binding selectivity for beta(3)-adrenoceptors against beta(1)-adrenoceptors, respectively, whereas they both showed a 7-fold higher binding selectivity for beta(3)-adrenoceptors against beta(2)-adrenoceptors. SWR-0098NA did not show any significant binding affinity for any of the beta-adrenoceptor subtypes. These compounds, except for SWR-0098NA, were not found to possess any significant binding affinity for alpha(1)-adrenoceptor subtypes over that for beta-adrenoceptor subtypes. However, SWR-0098NA has about a 3-fold to 22-fold higher binding selectivity for alpha(1)-adrenoceptor subtypes against beta-adrenoceptor subtypes, making it difficult for use in a beta-adrenoceptor receptor study. Compounds SWR-0315NA and SWR-0342SA have similar binding potency for alpha(1)-adrenoceptors as adrenaline (epinephrine), proving the finding of this manuscript that this phenoxypropanolamine group of beta-adrenoceptor ligands could also be used as alpha(1)-adrenoceptor ligands. Functional assays have to be performed to confirm their agonistic activity.

Human Brain Imaging and Radiation Dosimetry of <SUP>11</SUP>C-<i>N</i>-<i>Desmethyl</i>-Loperamide, a PET Radiotracer to Measure the Function of P-Glycoprotein	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						PET; N-desmethyl-loperamide; P-glycoprotein	2-DIMENSIONAL PLANAR; BIODISTRIBUTION; RADIOLIGAND; BARRIER; RADIOMETABOLITE; TRACER	P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a membrane-bound efflux pump that limits the distribution of drugs to several organs of the body. At the blood-brain barrier, P-gp blocks the entry of both loperamide and its metabolite, N-desmethyl-loperamide (N-dLop), and thereby prevents central opiate effects. Animal studies have shown that C-11-dLop, compared with C-11-loperamide, is an especially promising radiotracer because it generates negligible radiometabolites that enter the brain. The purposes of this study were to determine whether C-11-dLop is a substrate for P-gp at the blood-brain barrier in humans and to measure the distribution of radioactivity in the entire body to estimate radiation exposure. Methods: Brain PET scans were acquired in 4 healthy subjects for 90 min and included concurrent measurements of the plasma concentration of unchanged radiotracer. Time-activity data from the whole brain were quantified using a 1-tissue-compartment model to estimate the rate of entry (K-1) of radiotracer into the brain. Whole-body PET scans were acquired in 8 healthy subjects for 120 min. Results: For brain imaging, after the injection of C-11-dLop the concentration of radioactivity in the brain was low (standardized uptake value, similar to 15%) and stable after approximately 20 min. In contrast, uptake of radioactivity in the pituitary was about 50-fold higher than that in the brain. The plasma concentration of C-11-dLop declined rapidly, but the percentage composition of plasma was unusually stable, with the parent radiotracer constituting 85% of total radioactivity after approximately 5 min. The rate of brain entry was low (K-1 = 0.009 +/- 0.002 mL.cm(-3.)min(-1); n = 4). For whole-body imaging, as a measure of radiation exposure to the entire body the effective dose of C-11-dLop was 7.8 +/- 0.6 mu Sv/MBq (n = 8). Conclusion: The low brain uptake of radioactivity is consistent with C-11-dLop being a substrate for P-gp in humans and confirms that this radiotracer generates negligible quantities of brain-penetrant radiometabolites. In addition, the low rate of K-1 is consistent with P-gp rapidly effluxing substrates while they transit through the lipid bilayer. The radiation exposure of C-11-dLop is similar to that of many other C-11-radiotracers. Thus, C-11-dLop is a promising radiotracer to study the function of P-gp at the blood-brain barrier, at which impaired function would allow increased uptake into the brain.

Species differences in mGluR5 binding sites in mammalian central nervous system determined using in vitro binding with [<SUP>18</SUP>F]F-PEB	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						mGluR5; radioligand binding; CNS; species differences	METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; HUMAN-BRAIN; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MESSENGER-RNAS; RAT; EXPRESSION; PHARMACOLOGY; MONKEY; PET	Binding of [F-18]3-fluoro-5-[(pyridin-3-yl)ethynyl]benzonitrile ([F-18]F-PEB) was evaluated in membranes and tissue sections prepared from rat, rhesus and human brain. Saturation equilibrium binding experiments with frozen brain cortex and caudate-putamen membranes of young adult rhesus and human and with cortex and striatum from rat yielded data indicative of specific high-affinity binding (K-D=0.1-0.15 nM, n >= 3) to a saturable site previously shown to be metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5; Patel S, Ndubizu 0, Hamill T, Chaudhary A, Bums HD, Hargreaves RJ, Gibson RE. Screening cascade and development of potential positron emission tomography radiotracers for mGluR5: in vitro and in vivo characterization. Mol Imaging Biol 2005;7:314-323). High-affinity binding of [F-18]F-PEB was also detected in cerebellum membranes from rat, rhesus and human. The density of binding sites (B-max) measured using [F-18]F-PEB followed the rank order cortex similar to caudate-putamen/striatum > cerebellum for all three species, with the cerebellum B-max being significantly lower than that observed in the other regions. Receptor autoradiography studies in tissue sections confirmed that the regional distribution of [F-18]F-PEB in mammalian central nervous system is consistent with that of mGluR5 and that a small but specific mGluR5 signal is observed in rhesus and human cerebellum. A small and quantifiable specific signal could also be observed in rat cerebellum using this radiotracer. Immumohistochemical analysis in brain sections revealed a rank order of staining in rhesus and human brain of cortex similar to caudate-putamen > cerebellurn. Rat brain immunohistochemistry followed the same rank order, although the staining in the cerebellum was significantly lower. Using a "no-wash" wipe assay, the development of a specific signal within 20 min of incubation of tissue brain sections (> 60% in the cortex and striatum; 36-49% in the cerebellum) from all three species confirmed previous in vivo data from rat and rhesus monkey that [F-18]PEB is likely to provide a useful in vivo signal using positron emission tomography (PET). This study provides the first quantitative demonstration and direct comparison of a PET tracer candidate identifying mGluR5 binding sites in mammalian cerebellum, which subsequently raises questions in terms of using the cerebellum as a null tissue in PET imaging studies in the laboratory and the clinic.

Reduced basal and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated adenosine A<sub>1</sub> receptor expression in the brain of nuclear factor-κB p50<SUP>-/-</SUP> mice	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						NF-kappa B; A(1); adenosine receptor; lipopolysaccharide; CNS	RAT-BRAIN; TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVATION; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; P50 SUBUNIT; DNA-BINDING; CISPLATIN; INCREASES; SURVIVAL; ALPHA; LOCALIZATION	Adenosine promotes cytoprotection under conditions of infection, ischemic preconditioning and oxidative stress. Previous studies from our laboratory indicate that the expression of the adenosine A(1) receptor (A(1)AR) is induced by oxidative stress via activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B. The prototypic transcription factor is composed of homo- or heterodimers of p50 and p65 subunits. To determine the role of NF-KB in the regulation of the A(1)AR in vivo, we compared the A(1)AR RNA and protein levels in the brains of mice lacking the p50 subunit of NF-kappa B (p50(-/-) mice) and age-matched B6129PF2/J (F2) controls. Radioligand binding assays in the cortex revealed a significantly lower number of A(1)AR (maximal binding capacity B-max in the cortex of p50(-/-) mice (151 +/- 62 fmol/mg protein) versus 479 +/- 181 fmol/mg protein in the F2 (N=5 per strain, P<0.05), but no change in the equilibrium dissociation constant. Similar reductions in A(1)AR were measured in the hippocampus, brain stem and hypothalamus and in peripheral tissues, such as the adrenal gland, kidney and spleen. Estimation of the A(1)AR following purification by antibody affinity columns also indicated reduced A(1)AR in the p50(-/-) mice cortex, as compared with the F2 mice. A(1)AR immunocytochemistry indicates distinct neuronal labeling in the F2 cortex, which was substantially reduced in similar sections obtained from p50(-/-) mice. The p50(-/-) mice expressed lower levels of A(1)AR mRNA than F2 mice, as determined by real time PCR. Quantitation of the A(1)AR transducing G proteins by Western blotting show significantly less G(alpha i3), no change in G(alpha i1), but higher levels of G(alpha o) and G(beta) in the cortices of p50(-/-), as compared with F2 mice. Administration of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an activator of NF-KB, increased A(1)AR expression in the cortices of F2 mice but not p50(-/-) mice. Cortical neurons cultures prepared from p50(-/-) mice showed a greater degree of apoptosis, compared with neurons from F2 mice. Activation of the A(1)AR reduced apoptosis with greater efficacy in cultures from F2 than p50(-/-) mice. Taken together, these data support a role for NF-kappa B in determining both the basal and LPS-stimulated A(1)AR expression in vivo which could contribute to neuronal survival. (C) 2006 IBRO.

However, the expression of GLP-1R in atherosclerotic arteries remains uncertain. We evaluated whether a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer Ga-68-NODAGA-exendin-4 enables detection and imaging of GLP-1R expression in the mouse atherosclerotic aorta. Hypercholesterolemic (LDLR-/-ApoB(100/100)), hypercholesterolemic, diabetic (IGF-II/LDLR-/-ApoB(100/100)), and healthy control (C57BL/6N) mice were used in the study. The uptake of 68Ga-NODAGA-exendin-4 in atherosclerotic lesions was studied by autoradiography of tissue sections followed by immunofluorescence evaluation of inflammatory and vascular cell markers and GLP-1R. A subset of mice was imaged with Ga-68-NODAGA-exendin-4 PET/computed tomography (CT). The aortas of both LDLR--/-ApoB(100/100) and IGF-II/LDLR-/- ApoB(100/100) mice contained prominent, macrophage-rich atherosclerotic lesions. Diabetic mice demonstrated hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance. We found that by autoradiography, Ga-68-NODAGA-exendin-4 uptake was focally increased in macrophage-rich lesion areas compared with corresponding healthy vessel wall (lesion-to-wall ratio 1.6 +/- 0.10, P < 0.0001) in both nondiabetic and diabetic hypercholesterolemic mice. Preinjection of unlabeled exendin-4 peptide significantly reduced cellular uptake of Ga-68-NODAGA-exendin-4. Furthermore, PET/CT imaging showed Ga-68-NODAGA-exendin-4 accumulation in the atherosclerotic aorta. Immunofluorescence stainings demonstrated colocalization of GLP-1R with macrophage-rich areas in atherosclerotic lesions. Tracer uptake was low in the healthy vessel wall of C57BL/6N mice coupled with negative GLP-1R staining. In conclusion, Ga-68-NODAGA-exendin-4 detects GLP-1R expression in atherosclerotic lesions in both nondiabetic and diabetic hypercholesterolemic mice. These results provide evidence that GLP-1R expression is mainly localized in macrophage-rich area in atherosclerotic lesions and may have implications for studies of pharmacological modification of GLP-1R signaling in atherosclerosis. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Cardiovascular effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist therapies are potentially mediated by anti-inflammatory effects on atherosclerosis. Our study demonstrates that Ga-68-NODAGA-exendin-4, a radioligand specifically targeting GLP-1R, detects GLP-1R expression in inflamed atherosclerotic lesions in nondiabetic and diabetic hypercholesterolemic mice.

The aim of this study was to evaluate tracer kinetic models for quantitative analysis and generation of parametric images for the novel tau ligand (S)-F-18-THK5117. Methods: Nine subjects (5 with AD, 4 with mild cognitive impairment) received a 90-min dynamic (S)-F-18-THK5117 PET scan. Arterial blood was sampled for measurement of blood radioactivity and metabolite analysis. Volume-of-interest (VOI)-based analysis was performed using plasma-input models; single-tissue and 2-tissue (2TCM) compartment models and plasma-input Logan and reference tissue models; and simplified reference tissue model (SRTM), reference Logan, and SUV ratio (SUVr). Cerebellum gray matter was used as the reference region. Voxel-level analysis was performed using basis function implementations of SRTM, reference Logan, and SUVr. Regionally averaged voxel values were compared with VOI-based values from the optimal reference tissue model, and simulations were made to assess accuracy and precision. In addition to 90 min, initial 40- and 60-min data were analyzed. Results: Plasma-input Logan distribution volume ratio (DVR)-1 values agreed well with 2TCM DVR-1 values (R-2 = 0.99, slope = 0.96). SRTM binding potential (BPND) and reference Logan DVR-1 values were highly correlated with plasma-input Logan DVR-1 (R-2 = 1.00, slope approximate to 1.00) whereas SUVr(70-90)-1 values correlated less well and overestimated binding. Agreement between parametric methods and SRTM was best for reference Logan (R-2 = 0.99, slope = 1.03). SUVr(70-90)-1 values were almost 3 times higher than BPND values in white matter and 1.5 times higher in gray matter. Simulations showed poorer accuracy and precision for SUVr(70-90)-1 values than for the other reference methods. SRTM BPND and reference Logan DVR-1 values were not affected by a shorter scan duration of 60 min. Conclusion: SRTM BPND and reference Logan DVR-1 values were highly correlated with plasma-input Logan DVR-1 values. VOI-based data analyses indicated robust results for scan durations of 60 min. Reference Logan generated quantitative (S)-F-18-THK5117 DVR-1 parametric images with the greatest accuracy and precision and with a much lower white-matter signal than seen with SUVr(70-90)-1 images.

While the alpha1aAR is responsible for prostate smooth muscle relaxation and outlet obstruction relief, to our knowledge the mechanisms underlying the relief of irritative symptoms remain to be determined. Therefore, we investigated mechanisms by which bladder alpha1AR subtypes may be involved in this process. Materials and Methods: We studied 42 rats, including 6 unoperated controls, 17 sham operated controls and 19 obstructed animals. Animals were characterized for baseline voiding pattern, followed by surgical intervention or sham surgery to establish obstruction (1.09 mm. restricted opening). After 6 weeks to enable the development of detrusor hypertrophy, voiding behavior was reexamined, the animals were sacrificed and bladder tissue was immediately placed in liquid nitrogen. alpha1AR subtype messenger (m)RNA was quantitated using quantitative competitive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and protein expression was determined using radioligand binding with the alpha1AR antagonist [(125) iodine] 2-(- [4-hydroxyphenyl] -ethyl-aminomethyl)tetralone (saturation analysis for total alpha1AR density and competition analysis with BMY7378 and 5-methylurapidel to determine alpha1AR subtypes). Results: In this model 6-week surgical obstruction produced a 6.3-fold increase in bladder weight versus sham operation (p < 0.001), concurrent with increased voiding frequency versus before obstruction (p < 0.004). Although bladder alpha1AR density did not increase overall with obstruction, striking changes in alpha1AR subtype expression occurred. In control animals 70% of alpha1AR mRNA was the alpha1a subtype, 5% were alpha1b and 25% were alpha1d, whereas in obstructed animals bladder alpha1AR expression changed to 23% alpha1a, 2% alpha1b and 75% alpha1d. Changes in alpha1AR mRNA expression were of similar magnitude throughout the bladder dome, mid body and base. Parallel changes were also evident at the protein level with 100% alpha1aAR expression in control animals changing to new onset alpha1dAR expression (mean plus or minus standard error of mean 36% +/- 7%) in animals with a 5-fold or greater increase in bladder weight. Conclusions: Our findings indicate a remarkable increase in bladder alpha1dAR mRNA and protein expression after 6 weeks of obstruction and resultant detrusor hypertrophy. This finding is potentially important since alpha1dARs have 10 to 100-fold higher affinity for the endogenous neurotransmitter norepinephrine than the alpha1a or alpha1bAR subtypes. These findings imply that targeting alpha1d may provide a new therapeutic approach for controlling bladder irritative symptoms and possibly detrusor overactivity associated with bladder outlet obstruction.

In the recent time, endoradionuclide therapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate carcinoma employing Lu-177-PSMA-617 has yielded encouraging results and several clinical trials with the agent are currently ongoing. Routine preparation of Lu-177-PSMA-617 patient doses can be made simpler and convenient, if the ingredients essential for radiolabeling are made available in a ready-to-use lyophilized form. Methods. PSMA-617 freeze-dried kit was formulated and used for the preparation of Lu-177- PSMA-617 clinical dose with high radiochemical purity using low/medium specific activity Lu-177. Detailed radiochemical studies were performed to determine the maximum activity and volume of (LuCl3)-Lu-177, which can be added in the kit for the formulation of Lu-177-PSMA-617. Studies were also performed to determine the shelf life of the kit to ensure its long-term usage. Studies were performed in buffer as well as human serum medium to determine the stability of the Lu-177-PSMA-617 complex after storing in respective media up to 7 days postpreparation. About ten patient doses of Lu-177-PSMA-617 were administered, and posttherapy scans were acquired. Results. The formulated freeze-dried kit of PSMA-617 could be radiolabeled with an average percentage radiochemical purity > 98.53 +/- 0.38. The freeze-dried kit was found suitable for tolerating up to 0.5mL of (LuCl3)-Lu-177 (in 0.01N HCl) and specific activity of 555 MBq/mu g (15 mCi/mu g) for the preparation of the patient dose of Lu-177-PSMA-617. The Lu-177-PSMA-617 complex prepared using the freeze-dried kit of PSMA-617 was observed to maintain % radiochemical purity (RCP) of 96.74 +/- 0.87 and 94.81 +/- 2.66, respectively, even after storing up to 7 days in buffer and human serum, respectively. Lu-177-PSMA-617 prepared using the in-house formulated freeze-dried kit of PSMA-617 exhibited accumulation in metastatic lesions picked up in a pretherapy PET scan. Reduction in number as well as size of lesions was observed in posttherapy scans acquired after two months of administering the first therapeutic dose of Lu-177-PSMA-617. Conclusions. The freeze-dried kit of PSMA-617 could be used for the preparation of Lu-177-PSMA-617 with high radiochemical purity (>98%) in a reproducible manner. Lu-177-PSMA-617 prepared using the developed kit was successfully evaluated in patients suffering from metastatic prostate cancer.

We have recently expanded this approach toward human GRP(18-27) sequences and introduced Tc-99m-demomedin C, our first radiotracer based on GRP(18-27), showing favorable biologic characteristics during preclinical evaluation in rodents. We now present a series of Tc-99m-demomedin C analogs, generated by single-Gly(24) or double-Gly(24)/Met(27) substitutions in the peptide chain, and compare their performance in GRPR-positive in vitro and in vivo models. Methods: The SARNC ([(N-4)Gly(18)]GRP(18-27)) analogs (SARNC2 dAla(24), SARNC3 dAla(24)/Nle(27), SARNC4 dAla(24)/Leu(27), SARNC5 beta Ala(24), and SARNC6 Sar(24)) were synthesized on the solid support and purified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Competition binding experiments against [I-125-Tyr(4)]BBN were conducted in GRPR-positive PC-3 cell membranes. Internalization of Tc-99m radioligands was compared in PC-3 cells at 37 degrees C. Metabolic stability was studied by HPLC analysis of blood samples collected 5 min after injection of radiopeptides in mice. Biodistribution was performed by injecting a Tc-99m-SARNC bolus (185 kBq [5 mu Ci], 100 mu L, 10 pmol of peptide +/- 40 nmol of Tyr(4)-BBN: in vivo GRPR blockade) in severe combined immune deficient mice bearing PC-3 xenografts. Results: SARNCs bound to GRPR with high affinity (range of 50% inhibitory concentration [IC50] values, 0.3 nM [SARNC5] to 9.3 nM [SARNC4]). Tc-99m-SARNCs specifically internalized in PC-3 cells, with Tc-99m-SARNC5 displaying the fastest internalization rate. Tc-99m-SARNCs showed distinct degradation rates (17% [Tc-99m-SARNC3] to >50% [Tc-99m-SARNC4] remaining intact). All Tc-99m-SARNCs efficiently and specifically localized in GRPR-positive PC-3 xenografts in mice (4.4 percentage injected dose per gram [%ID/g] [Tc-99m-SARNC4] to 12.0 %ID/g [Tc-99m-SARNC2] at 4 h after injection). Tc-99m-SARNC6 displayed the highest tumor-to-nontumor ratios followed by Tc-99m-SARNC2. Conclusion: This structure-activity relationship study has shown the impact of single-Gly(24) or double-Gly(24)/Met(27) substitutions in the Tc-99m-SARNC1 motif on key biologic parameters, including GRPR affinity, internalization efficiency, and in vivo stability, which eventually determine the pharmacokinetic profile of resulting radiopeptides. By revealing improved analogs, this study has strengthened the applicability perspectives of radioligands based on human GRP sequences in the detection and therapy of GRPR-expressing tumors in humans.

Identifying improved TSPO PET imaging probes through biomathematics: The impact of multiple TSPO binding sites in vivo	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						TSPO; PET; Radioligand; Biomathematical modelling; Multiple binding affinities	BRAIN; NEUROINFLAMMATION; RADIOLIGANDS; INFLAMMATION; AFFINITY; HUMANS; PENETRATION; PREDICTION; BIOMARKER; MONKEY	To date, C-11-(R)-PK11195 has been the most widely used TSPO PET imaging probe, although it suffers from high non-specific binding and low signal to noise. A significant number of 2nd generation TSPO radioligands have been developed with higher affinity and/or lower non-specific binding, however there is substantial inter-subject variation in their affinity for the TSPO. TSPO from human tissue samples binds 2nd generation TSPO radioligands with either high affinity (high affinity binders, HABs), or low affinity (LABs) or expresses both HAB and LAB binding sites (mixed affinity binders, MABs). The expression of these different TSPO binding sites in human is encoded by the rs6971 polymorphism in the TSPO gene. Here, we use a predictive biomathematical model to estimate the in vivo performances of three of these 2nd generation radioligands (F-18-PBR111, C-11-PBR28, C-11-DPA713) and C-11-(R)-PK11195 in humans. The biomathematical model only relies on in silico, in vitro and genetic data (polymorphism frequencies in different ethnic groups) to predict the radioactivity time course in vivo. In particular, we provide estimates of the performances of these ligands in within-subject (e.g. longitudinal studies) and between-subject (e.g. disease characterisation) PET studies, with and without knowledge of the TSPO binding class. This enables an assessment of the different radioligands prior to radiolabelling or acquisition of any in vivo data. The within-subject performance was characterised in terms of the reproducibility of the in vivo binding potential (%COV[BPND]) for each separate TSPO binding class in normal and diseased states (50% to 400% increase in TSPO density), whilst the between-subject performance was characterised in terms of the number of subjects required to distinguish between different populations. The results indicated that the within-subject variability for F-18-PBR111, C-11-PBR28 and C-11-DPA713 (0.9% to 2.2%) was significantly lower than C-11-(R)-PK11195 (16% to 36%) for HABs and MABs in both normal and diseased states. For between-subject studies, sample sizes required to detect 50% differences in TSPO density with the 2nd generation tracers are approximately half that required with C-11-(R)-PK11195 when binding class information is known a priori. As binding class can be identified using a simple genetic test or from peripheral blood assays, the combination of binding class information with 2nd generation TSPO imaging data should provide superior tools to investigate inflammatory processes in humans in vivo.

In addition, we studied the feasibility of using these tracers following a period of awake tracer uptake, during which the animal may perform a behavioral task. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were imaged with [F-18] fallypride and with [F-18] DMFP in four different studies using microPET. All scans were performed under isoflurane anesthesia. The first (test) and second (retest) study were 150-min baseline scans. No retest scans were performed with [F-18] DMFP. A third study was a 60-min awake uptake of radiotracer followed by a 90-min scan. A fourth study was a 150-min competition scan with haloperidol (0.2 mg/kg) administered via tail vein at 90-min post-[F-18] fallypride injection and 60-min post-[F-18] DMFP. For the test-retest studies, BPND was measured using both Logan noninvasive (LNI) method and the interval ratios (ITR) method. Cerebellum was used as a reference region. For the third study, the binding was measured only with the ITR method, and the results were compared to the baseline results. Studies showed that the average transient equilibrium time in the dorsal striatum (DSTR) was at 90 min for [F-18] fallypride and 30 min for [F-18] DMFP. The average BPND for [F-18] fallypride was 14.4 in DSTR, 6.8 in ventral striatum (VSTR), 1.3 in substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA), 1.4 in colliculi (COL), and 1.5 in central gray area. In the case of [F-18] DMFP, the average BPND values were 2.2 in DSTR, 2.7 in VSTR, and 0.8 in SN/VTA. The haloperidol blockade showed detectable decrease in binding of both tracers in striatal regions with a faster displacement of [F-18] DMFP. No significant changes in BPND of [F-18] fallypride due to the initial awake state of the animal were found, whereas BPND of [F-18] DMFP was significantly higher in the awake state compared to baseline. We were able to demonstrate that dynamic PET using MicroPET Inveon allows quantification of both striatal and extrastriatal [F-18] fallypride binding in rats in vivo. Quantification of the striatal regions could be achieved with [F-18] DMFP. Synapse 65:778-787, 2011. (C) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

J	Faber, JE; Yang, NY				Faber, JE; Yang, NY			Balloon injury alters α-adrenoceptor expression across rat carotid artery wall	CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PHARMACOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						alpha-adrenoceptor expression; adventitia; artery; balloon injury; fibroblast growth factor-2; media; transforming growth factor-beta 1; vascular smooth muscle cells	VASCULAR SMOOTH-MUSCLE; ADVENTITIAL FIBROBLASTS; INTIMAL HYPERPLASIA; RECEPTOR GENE; GROWTH; CELLS; ALPHA(1)-ADRENOCEPTORS; CULTURE; TRANSACTIVATION; NOREPINEPHRINE	alpha(1)-Adrenoceptors (AR) mediate growth factor-like activity of catecholamines on vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) and adventitial fibroblasts. This trophic activity is strongly augmented by balloon injury, contributes significantly to subsequent proliferation, wall hypertrophy and lumen loss and is mediated by alpha(1A)- and alpha(1B)-AR. However, it is not known how injury augments adrenergic trophic activity. The aim of the present study was to examine alpha-AR expression in rat carotid artery and to test the hypothesis that balloon injury augments alpha(1)-AR expression. Neointima, media and adventitia were isolated at various days after balloon injury of rat carotid artery and subjected to quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and radioligand binding. Cultured SMC were also studied. Transcripts for alpha(1A)-, alpha(1B)-, alpha(1D)- and alpha(2D)-AR were expressed in different proportions in media and adventitia from uninjured carotid artery. Injury caused a reduction by as much as 85% at day 4 in all alpha-AR mRNA (but not cyclophilin) in both the media and adventitia. In both layers, expression returned to control by day 21 for alpha(2D)-AR and by day 42 for alpha(1A)-AR, but remained reduced by 25-50% for alpha(1B)- and alpha(1D)-AR at 42 days. alpha(1)-Adrenoceptor transcripts in the neointima at 21 and 42 days after injury were expressed at levels more than 80% lower than in the media or adventitia of uninjured carotid; alpha(2D)-AR mRNA was undetectable. The density of total alpha(1)-AR binding sites was similar in the media and adventitia of uninjured carotid. Density was reduced by approximately 60% in the intima-media and adventitia 21 days after injury. To examine possible mechanisms, early passaged cultured SMC were studied that express alpha(1D)- and alpha(1B)-AR at levels similar to in vivo but that do not express other alpha-AR. Basic fibroblast growth factor caused downregulation of alpha(1D)-AR mRNA and alpha(1)-AR density, without affecting mRNA half-life, whereas transforming growth factor-beta 1 had no effect. Neither growth factor altered alpha(1B)-AR message expression. These data demonstrate that: (i) carotid artery expresses the same four a-AR genes and similar total alpha(1)-AR density in the SMC media and fibroblast-rich adventitia; and (ii) injury induced enhancement of adrenergic trophic activity is not caused by upregulation of alpha(1)-AR, but, instead, is associated with a generalized reduction in a-AR expression.

The integrin receptor alpha(v)beta(3), which is found on endothelial cells lining newly growing blood vessels at a higher density than on mature blood vessels, is being explored as a marker for tumor angiogenesis. Bitistatin, a member of the disintegrin family of polypeptides, has affinity for alpha(v)beta(3) integrins. To determine whether radiolabeled bitistatin could target tumors, its biodistribution was tested in tumor-bearing mice. For initial validation studies, I-125-bitistatin was injected into BALB/c mice bearing EMT-6 mouse mammary carcinoma tumors, a model that is highly vascular but which lacks alpha(v)beta(3) directly on tumor cells. Tumor uptake reached maximal values (11.7 +/- 4.6 %ID/g) at 2 h. Co-injection of 200 mug of unlabeled bitistatin reduced tumor uptake 62%, suggesting that the binding of I-125-bitistatin is receptor-mediated. This work was extended to include the beta(+)-emitting radionuclide Cu-64, which was attached to bitistatin via 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N",N'''-tetraacetic acid (DOTA). This modification did not significantly alter receptor binding in vitro. MicroPET images obtained with Cu-64-DOTA-bitistatin showed that the tumor could easily be identified 4 h after administering the radiopharmaceutical. The biodistribution of Cu-64-DOTA-bitistatin differed from the I-125 analogue, in that maximum tumor uptake was nearly 8-fold lower and took at least 6 h to reach maximal binding (1.6 +/- 0.2 %ID/g). As with I-125-labeled bitistatin, the (6)4CU conjugate showed a 50% reduction in tumor uptake with the co-injection of 200,mug of unlabeled bitistatin (0.8 +/- 0.2 %ID/g). Competition studies with integrin-specific peptides indicated that the tumor uptake was related to both alpha(v)beta(3) and alpha(IIb)beta(3) integrin binding. To see if tumor uptake could be improved upon, Cu-64 was tethered to bitistatin using bromoacetamidobenzyl-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N",N'''-tetraacetic acid (BAD). Tumor uptake for Cu-64-BAD-2IT-bitistatin was higher than the DOTA conjugate at all time points, reaching a maximum at least 6 h postinjection (5.2 +/- 0.6 %ID/g); however, this was accompanied by higher uptake in nontarget organs at all time points. Radiolabeled ligands of this type may be useful in the targeting of tumor angiogenesis, but the choice of radiolabeling approach has a significant impact on the in vivo properties of the radioligand.

Neuromelanin content is thought to reflect the loss of pigmented neurons, but available data characterizing its relationship with striatal dopaminergic integrity are not comprehensive or consistent, and predominantly involve heterogeneous samples. In this cross-sectional study, we used neuromelanin-sensitive MRI and the highly specific dopamine transporter PET radioligand, C-11-PE2I, to assess the association between neuromelanin-containing cell levels in the substantia nigra pars compacta and nigrostriatal terminal density in vivo, in 30 patients with bilateral Parkinson's disease. Fifteen healthy control subjects also underwent neuromelanin-sensitive imaging. We used a novel approach taking into account the anatomical and functional subdivision of substantia nigra into dorsal and ventral tiers and striatal nuclei into pre- and post-commissural subregions, in accordance with previous animal and post-mortem studies, and consider the clinically asymmetric disease presentation. In vivo, Parkinson's disease subjects displayed reduced neuromelanin levels in the ventral (-30 +/- 28%) and dorsal tiers (-21 +/- 24%) as compared to the control group [F(1,43) = 11.95, P = 0.001]. Within the Parkinson's disease group, nigral pigmentation was lower in the ventral tier as compared to the dorsal tier [F(1,29) = 36.19, P < 0.001] and lower in the clinically-defined most affected side [F(1,29) = 4.85, P = 0.036]. Similarly, lower dopamine transporter density was observed in the ventral tier [F(1,29) = 76.39, P < 0.001] and clinically-defined most affected side [F(1,29) = 4.21, P = 0.049]. Despite similar patterns, regression analysis showed no significant association between nigral pigmentation and nigral dopamine transporter density. However, for the clinically-defined most affected side, significant relationships were observed between pigmentation of the ventral nigral tier with striatal dopamine transporter binding in pre-commissural and post-commissural striatal subregions known to receive nigrostriatal projections from this tier, while the dorsal tier correlated with striatal projection sites in the pre-commissural striatum (P < 0.05, Benjamini-Hochberg corrected). In contrast, there were no statistically significant relationships between these two measures in the clinically-defined least affected side. These findings provide important insights into the topography of nigrostriatal neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease, indicating that the characteristics of disease progression may fundamentally differ across hemispheres and support post-mortem data showing asynchrony in the loss of neuromelanin-containing versus tyrosine hydroxylase positive nigral cells.

Quantification of the Specific Translocator Protein Signal of <SUP>18</SUP>F-PBR111 in Healthy Humans: A Genetic Polymorphism Effect on In Vivo Binding	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						F-18-PBR111; TSPO; specific binding; neuroinflammation; rs6971 polymorphism	PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; 18 KDA; MICROGLIAL ACTIVATION; HUMAN BRAIN; RADIOLIGAND BINDING; PET; AFFINITY; BIOMARKER; SITES	PET is used to image active inflammatory processes by targeting the translocator protein (TSPO). In vitro, second-generation TSPO radioligands, such as PBR111, have been shown to bind to human tissue samples with either high affinity (high-affinity binders, HABs), low affinity (low-affinity binders, LABs), or an intermediate, mixed affinity (mixed-affinity binders, MABs). We previously explained these differences in affinity in human tissue via the rs6971 polymorphism in the TSPO gene and predicted that the specific signal from PET ligands in vivo would vary accordingly. In silico modeling predicted that F-18-PBR111 would have a moderate to high specificto- nonspecific ratio in the normal human brain. To test these predictions, we present here the analysis and modeling of F-18-PBR111 data in healthy humans. Methods: Twenty-one subjects (9 HABs, 8 MABs, and 4 LABs), 28-62 y old, genotyped for the rs6971 polymorphism, underwent 120-min PET scans with arterial sampling after a bolus injection of F-18-PBR111. Compartmental models and Logan graphical methods enabled estimation of the total volume of distribution (VT) in regions of interest (ROIs). To evaluate the specific signal, we developed 2 methods to estimate the nondisplaceable volume of distribution (VND): the first assumed that the in vitro affinity ratio of F-18-PBR111 in HABs relative to LABs (4-fold) is preserved in vivo; the second modeled the difference in the HAB and MAB signals in the context of an occupancy plot. Results: A 2-tissue-compartment model described the data well, and a significant difference was found between the V-T of HABs, MABs, and LABs across all ROIs examined (P < 0.05). We also found a significant correlation between VT and age for both HABs and MABs in most ROIs. The average VND estimated by the 2 methods was 1.18 +/- 0.35 (method I: V-ND = 0.93, method II: V-ND = 1.42), implying that the F-18-PBR111 BPND was 2.78 +/- 0.46 in HABs, 1.48 +/- 0.28 in MABs, and 0.51 +/- 0.17 in LABs and that the in vivo affinity ratio was similar to that measured in vitro. Conclusion: F-18-PBR111 shows a high specific signal in the healthy human brain in vivo. A large component of the variability in the signal across subjects is explained by genetic variation and age, indicating that F-18-PBR111 can be used for the quantitative assessment of TSPO expression.

Thus, radiolabeled BN or BN analogs may prove to be specific tracers for diagnostic and therapeutic targeting of GRP-r-positive tumors in nuclear medicine. This study evaluated a novel BN analog labeled with the positron emitter Ga-68 for receptor imaging with PET. Methods: DOTA-PEG(2)-[D-Tyr(6), beta-Ala(11),Thi(13), Nle(14)] BN(6-14) amide (BZH3) (DOTA is 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N",N'"-tetraacetic acid; PEG is ethyleneglycol (2-aminoethyl)carboxymethyl ether) was synthetized using the Fmoc strategy and radiolabeled with either Ga-67 or Lu-177 for in vitro and biodistribution experiments. Ga-68 for PET was obtained from a Ge-68/Ga-68 generator. In vitro binding, internalization, and efflux were determined using the pancreatic tumor cell line AR42J. Biodistribution of the peptide as a function of time and dose was studied in AR42J tumor-bearing mice. Results: In vitro assays demonstrated a high affinity of Ga-67-BZH3 (dissociation constant = 0.46 nmol/L), a rapid internalization (70% of total cell-associated activity was endocytosed after a 15-min incubation), and an intracellular retention half-life (t(1/2)) of the 67Ga activity of 16.5 +/- 2.4 h. Biodistribution indicated a dose-dependent uptake in the tumor and a prolonged tumor residence time (t(1/2) similar to 16 h). Clearance from GRP-r-negative tissues was fast, resulting in high tumor-to-tissue ratios as early as 1 h after injection. Replacing Ga-67 by Lu-177, a therapeutic radionuclide, for peptide labeling resulted in a slightly reduced (similar to 20%) tumor uptake and tumor residence time of Lu-177-BZH3. In contrast, Lu-177 decline in the pancreas was significantly accelerated by a factor of similar to 3 compared with that of Ga-67. PET of mice with Ga-68-BZH3 clearly delineated tumors in the mediastinal area. Conclusion: The promising in vivo data of Ga-68-BZH3 indicate its potential for an improved localization of GRP-r-positive tumors and also suggest its application in patients. PET may also be favorably used for GRP-r density determination, a prerequisite for therapeutic applications.

The noninvasive imaging of CXCR4 can enable the detection and characterization of aggressive cancers with poor outcomes. Currently, no F-18-labeled CXCR4 positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer has demonstrated imaging contrast comparable to [Ga-68]Ga-Pentixafor, a CXCR4-targeting radioligand. We, therefore, aimed to develop a high-contrast CXCR4-targeting radiotracer by incorporating a hydrophilic linker and trifluoroborate radioprosthesis to LY2510924, a known CXCR4 antagonist. A carboxy-ammoniomethyl-trifluoroborate (PepBF(3)) moiety was conjugated to the LY2510924-derived peptide possessing a triglutamate linker via amide bond formation to obtain BL08, whereas an alkyne ammoniomethyl-trifluoroborate (AMBF(3)) moiety was conjugated using the copper-catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition click reaction to obtain BL09. BL08 and BL09 were radiolabeled with [F-18]fluoride ion using F-18-F-19 isotope exchange. Pentixafor was radiolabeled with [Ga-68]GaCl3. Side-by-side PET imaging and biodistribution studies were performed on immunocompromised mice bearing Daudi Burkitt lymphoma xenografts. The biodistribution of [F-18]BL08 and [18F]BL09 showed tumor uptake at 2 h postinjection (p.i.) (5.67 +/- 1.25%ID/g and 5.83 +/- 0.92%ID/g, respectively), which were concordant with the results of PET imaging. [F-18]BL08 had low background activity, providing tumor-to-blood, -muscle, and -liver ratios of 72 +/- 20, 339 +/- 81, and 14 +/- 3 (2 h p.i.), respectively. [F-18]BL09 behaved similarly, with ratios of 64 +/- 20, 239 +/- 72, and 17 +/- 3 (2 h p.i.), respectively. This resulted in high-contrast visualization of tumors on PET imaging for both radiotracers. [F-18]BL08 exhibited lower kidney uptake (2.2 +/- 0.5%ID/g) compared to [F-18]BL09 (7.6 +/- 1.0%ID/g) at 2 h p.i. [F-18]BL08 and [F-18]BL09 demonstrated higher tumor-to-blood, -muscle, and -liver ratios compared to [Ga-68]Ga-Pentixafor (18.9 +/- 2.7, 95.4 +/- 36.7, and 5.9 +/- 0.7 at 2 h p.i., respectively). In conclusion, [F-18]BL08 and [F-18]BL09 enable high-contrast visualization of CXCR4 expression in Daudi xenografts. Based on high tumor-to-organ ratios, [F-18]BL08 may prove a valuable new tool for CXCR4-targeted PET imaging with potential for translation. The use of a PepBF3 moiety is a new approach for the orthogonal conjugation of organotrifluoroborates for F-18-labeling of peptides.

Recent findings also support long-term improvements in executive functions (behavior, emotion, cognition) in these patients. The observed clinical profile is inconsistent with serotonergic activity alone, as other serotonergic medications have not been demonstrated to have these dinical effects. This study investigated a potential role for sigma(1) receptor activity in complementing fenfluramine's serotonergic pharmacology. Methods: Radioligand binding assays tested the affinity of fenfluramine for 47 receptors associated with seizures in the literature, including sigma receptors. Cellular function assays tested fenfluramine and norfenfluramine (its major metabolite) activity at various receptors, including adrenergic, muscarinic, and serotonergic receptors. The sigma(1) receptor activity was assessed by the mouse vas deferens isometric twitch and by an assay of dissociation of the sigma(1) receptor from the endoplasmic reticulum stress protein binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP). In vivo mouse models assessed fenfluramine activity at sigma(1) receptors in ameliorating dizocilpine-induced learning deficits in spatial and nonspatial memory tasks, alone or in combination with the reference sigma(1) receptor agonist PRE-084. Results: Fenfluramine and norfenfluramine bound >= 30% to beta 2 -adrenergic, muscarinic M-1, serotonergic 5-HT1A, and sigma receptors, as well as sodium channels, with a K-i between 266 nM (sigma receptors) and 17.5 mu M (beta-adrenergic receptors). However, only sigma(1) receptor isometric twitch assays showed a positive functional response, with weak stimulation by fenfluramine and inhibition by norfenfluramine. Fenfluramine, but not the 5-HT2C agonist lorcaserin, showed a positive modulation of the PRE-084-induced dissociation of sigma(1) protein from BiP. Fenfluramine also showed dose-dependent antiamnesic effects against dizocilpine-induced learning deficits in spontaneous alternation and passive avoidance responses, which are models of sigma(1) activation. Moreover, low doses of fenfluramine synergistically potentiated the low-dose effect of PRE-084, confirming a positive modulatory effect at the sigma(1) receptor. Finally, all in vivo effects were blocked by the sigma(1) receptor antagonist NE-100. Significance: Fenfluramine demonstrated modulatory activity at sigma(1) receptors in vitro and in vivo in addition to its known serotonergic activity. These studies identify a possible new sigma(1) receptor mechanism underpinning fenfluramine's central nervous system effects, which may contribute to its antiseizure activity in Dravet syndrome and positive effects observed on executive functions in clinical studies.

Biodistribution and Radiation Dosimetry of the Integrin Marker <SUP>64</SUP>Cu-BaBaSar-RGD<sub>2</sub> Determined from Whole-Body PET/CT in a Non-human Primate	FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS			English	Article						Integrin alpha(v)beta(3); Cu-64-BaBaSar-RGD(2); radiation dosimetry; PET CT; non-human primate	CANCER PATIENTS; RGD PEPTIDE; IN-VIVO; ALPHA(V)BETA(3); F-18-AH111585; EXPRESSION; THERAPY; RADIOLIGAND; APOPTOSIS; MONKEYS	Introduction: Cu-64 BaBaSar RGD(2) is a positron emission radiotracer taken up by integrin alpha(v)beta(3), which is overexpressed in many malignancies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the biodistribution of Cu-64-BaBaSar-RGD(2) in a non-human primate with positron emission tomography (PET) and to estimate the absorbed doses in major organs for human. Materials and Methods: Whole-body PET imaging was done on a Siemens Biograph scanner with a male macaque monkey. After an i.v. injection of 13.1-19.7 MBq/kg of Cu-64-BaBaSar-RGD(2), whole body scan was collected for a total duration of 180 min. Attenuation and scatter corrections were applied to reconstructions of the whole-body emission scan. After image reconstruction, three-dimensional volumes of interest (V01) were hand -drawn on the PET transaxial or coronal slices of the frame where the organ was most conspicuous. Time -activity curves (TACs) for each VOI were obtained, and residence times of each organ were calculated by integration of the time -activity curves. Human absorbed doses were estimated using the standard human model in OLIN DA/EXM software. Results: Injection of Cu-64-BaBaSar-RGD(2) was well-tolerated in the macaque monkey, with no serious tracer -related adverse events observed. Cu-64-BaBaSar-RGD(2) was cleared rapidly from the blood pool, with a 12.1 -min biological half-life. Increased Cu-64-BaBaSar-RGD(2) uptake was observed in the kidneys, and bladder, with mean percentage injected dose (ID%) values at 1 h after injection similar to 35.50 +/- 6.47 and 36.89 +/- 5.48, respectively. The calculated effective dose was 15.30 +/- 2.211 mu Sv/MBq, and the kidneys had the highest absorbed dose at 108.43 +/- 16.41 mu Gy/MBq using the non-voiding model. For an injected activity of 925 MBq Cu-64 for human, the effective dose would be 14.2 +/- 2.1 mSv. Discussion: Due to the limited availability of the primates, we evaluated Cu-64-BaBaSar-RGD(2) in the same monkey using three imaging sessions. Measured absorbed doses and effective doses of Cu-64-BaBaSar-RGD(2) are comparable to other reported RGDderived radiopharmaceuticals labeled with Cu-64 and F-18 Therefore, Cu-64-BaBaSar-RGD(2) can be safely injected into humans for studying integrin alpha(v)beta(3) expression non-invasively.

WAY-161503 displaced both agonist ([I-125]2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI)) and antagonist ([H-3]mesulergine) radioligand binding to the human 5-HT2C receptor with derived Ki values of 3.3 +/- 0.9 and 32 +/- 6 nM, respectively. Relative to 5-HT2C receptor binding, WAY-161503 was approximately 6-fold less potent at human 5-HT2A, receptors ([I-125] DOI) with a derived Ki value of 18 nM and 20-fold less potent at human S-HT2B receptors ([H-3]5-HT) with a derived Ki value of 60 nM. In functional studies, WAY-161503 was a full agonist in stimulating 5-HT2C-receptor-coupled [H-3]inositol phosphate (IP) formation and calcium mobilization with EC50 values of 8.5 nM and 0.8 nM, respectively. WAY-161503 was also a 5-HT2B agonist (EC(50)s of 6.9 and 1.8 nM for IP and calcium, respectively). In IP studies, WAY-161503 was a weak 5-HT2A partial agonist (EC50, 802 nM) yet potently stimulated calcium mobilization (EC50, 7 nM) in 5-HT2A receptor-expressing cells. Functionally, WAY-161503 also stimulated the phospholipase A(2)-coupled arachidonic acid release in 5-HT2C receptor expressing cells albeit with lower potency (EC50, 38 nM) and efficacy (Emax, 77%) compared with activation of the PLC pathway. In vivo, WAY-161503 produced dose-dependent decreases in 2-h food intake in 24 h fasted normal Sprague-Dawley rats, diet-induced obese mice, and obese Zuker rats with ED50 values of 1.9 mg/kg, 6.8 mg/kg, and 0.73 mg/kg, respectively. The reduction in food intake in normal Sprague-Dawley rats was reversed by administration of the 5-HT2C receptor antagonist SB-242084. Following chronic administration (10 days) in growing Sprague-Dawley rats, WAY-161503 decreased food intake and attenuated body weight gain. Finally, following chronic administration (15 days) of WAY-161503 to obese Zuker rats, the rats maintained a 30% decrease in food intake over the 15-day period combined with a 25 g decrease in body weight relative to vehicle-treated controls demonstrating a lack of tolerance to its anorectic effects.

We report the development and evaluation of a putative antagonist, 5-(3'-fluoropropyl)-3-(2-(S)-pyrrolidinylmethoxy)pyridine (nifrolidine) as a PET agent for nicotine alpha(4)beta(2) receptors. Methods: In vitro binding affinity of nifrolidine was measured in rat brain slices labeled with I-125-iodoepibatidine or I-125-bungaratoxin. Selectivity of binding was measured in the presence of cytisine. F-18 radiolabeling was performed by reacting the tosylate precursor with F-18-fluoride followed by cleprotection. In vitro autoradiographic studies in rat brain slices with 5-(3'-F-18-fluoropropyl)-3-(2-(S)-pyrrolidinylmethoxy)pyridine (F-18-nifrolidine) were read on a phosphor imager. Rats were injected with F-18-nifrolidine (3.7 MBq each), and brain regions were counted at various times (2-120 min). Blocking studies were performed by subcutaneous injection of nicotine (10 mg/kg). A PET study of F-18-nifrolidine (approximately 148 MBq) was performed on an anesthetized rhesus monkey using a high-resolution scanner. Results: In vitro binding affinity of nifrolidine exhibited an inhibition constant of 2.89 nmol/L for the alpha(4)beta(2) sites. Radiosynthesis and high-performance liquid chromatography purifications yielded the product in approximately 20%-40% decay-corrected radiochemical yield to provide 18F-nifrolidine specific activities of approximately 111-185 GBq/mumol. In vitro autoradiography in rat brain slices revealed selective binding of F-18-nifrolidine to the anteroventral thalamic nucleus, ventral posteriomedial thalamus, dorsolateral geniculate, and, to a lesser extent, cortex and striata, which are known to contain alpha(4)beta(2) sites. This specific binding was completely abolished by 300 mumol/L nicotine. Ex vivo rat brain distribution studies indicated selective binding in the thalamus with a maximal thalamus-to-cerebellum ratio of approximately 3. The PET study revealed selective maximal uptake (0.01 % injected dose/mL) in regions of the thalamus (anteroventral and anteromedial mus, ventrolateral thalamus) and extrathalamic regions such as cingulate gyrus, lateral geniculate, temporal cortex, and frontal cortex. Conclusion: Binding of F-18-nifrolidine to alpha(4)beta(2) receptor-rich regions in rats and monkeys indicates promise as a PET agent. Additionally, the thalamus-to-cerebellum ratio approached a plateau of 1.7 in 120 min, indicating relatively faster kinetics compared with previously reported imaging agents.

Of these compounds, fluoromethyl (4) and fluoroethyl (5) analogues had similar or higher affinities for PBR than the parent compound 2 (K-i = 0.16 nM for PBR in rat brain sections). Iodomethyl analogue 6 displayed a moderate affinity, whereas tosyloxyethyl analogue 7 had weak affinity. Radiolabeling was performed for the fluoroalkyl analogues 4 and 5 using fluorine-18 (F-18, beta(+); 96.7%, T-1/2 = 109.8 min). Ligands [F-18]4 and [F-18]5 were respectively synthesized by the alkylation of desmethyl precursor 3 with [F-18]fluoromethyl iodide ([F-18]8) and 2-[F-18]fluoroethyl bromide ([F-18]9). The distribution patterns of [F-18]4 and [F-18]5 in mice were consistent with the known distribution of PBR. However, compared with [F-18]5, [F-18]4 displayed a high uptake in the bone of mice. The PET image of [F-18]4 for monkey brain also showed significant radioactivity in the bone, suggesting that this ligand was unstable for in vivo defluorination and was not a useful PET ligand. Ligand [F-18]5 displayed a high uptake in monkey brain especially in the occipital cortex, a region with richer PBR than the other regions in the brain. The radioactivity level of [F-18]5 in monkey brain was 1.5 times higher than that of [C-11]2, and 6 times higher than that of (R)-(1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-[C-11]methyl,N-(1-methylpropyl)isoquinoline ([C-11]1). Moreover, the in vivo binding of [F-18]5 was significantly inhibited by PBR-selective 2 or 1, indicating that the binding of [F-18]5 in the monkey brain was mainly due to PBR. Metabolite analysis revealed that [F-18]4 was rapidly metabolized by defluorination to [F-18]F- in the plasma and brain of mice, whereas [F-18]5 was metabolized by debenzylation to a polar product [F-18]13 only in the plasma. No radioactive metabolite of [F-18]5 was detected in the mouse brain. The biological data indicate that [F-18]5 is a useful PET ligand for PBR and is currently used for imaging PBR in human brain.

The functional activity of trimeric G proteins and capacity of the DOP receptor to stimulate both the fusion protein-linked G(i)1alpha and endogenous pertussis-toxin sensitive G proteins was measured as d-Ala2, d-Leu5-enkephalin stimulated high-affinity GTPase or guanosine-5'-[gamma-S-35]triphosphate ([S-35]GTPgammaS) binding. The maximum d-Ala2-d-Leu5 enkephalin (DADLE)-stimulated GTPase was two times higher in low-density membrane fragments than in bulk of plasma membranes; 58 and 27 pmol/mg/min, respectively. The same difference was obtained for [S-35]GTPgammaS binding. Contrarily, the low-density domains contained no more than half the DOP receptor binding sites (B-max = 6.6 pmol/mg versus 13.6 pmol/mg). Thus, when corrected for expression levels of the receptor, low-density domains exhibited four times higher agonist-stimulated GTPase and [S-35]GTPgammaS binding than the bulk plasma membranes. The regulator of G protein signaling RGS1, enhanced further the G protein functional activity but did not remove the difference between domain-bound and plasma membrane pools of G protein. The potency of the agonist in functional studies and the affinity of specific [H-3]DADLE binding to the receptor were, however, the same in both types of membranes - EC50 = 4.5 +/- 0.1 x 10(-8) and 3.2 +/- 1.4 x 10(-8) m for GTPase; K-d = 1.2 +/- 0.1 and 1.3 +/- 0.1 nm for [H-3]DADLE radioligand binding assay. Similar results were obtained when sodium bicarbonate was used for alkaline isolation of membrane domains. By contrast, detergent-insensitive membrane domains isolated following treatment of cells with Triton X100 exhibited no DADLE-stimulated GTPase or GTPgammaS binding. Functional coupling between the DOP receptor and cognate G proteins was also blocked by high-energy ultrasound and repeated freezing-thawing. Our data indicate, for the first time, that membrane domains isolated using 'detergent-free' procedures exhibit higher efficiency of coupling between a G protein-coupled receptor and its corresponding G protein(s) than bulk plasma membranes. Detergent-extraction diminishes these interactions, even when the receptor and G proteins are physically tethered together.

High concentrations of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I and IGF-II have been demonstrated in human colonic adenocarcinomas and exert mitogenic effects through paracrine/autocrine interactions with the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR). However, definitive studies of IGF-IR expression in these tissues have not been performed. METHODS. To study changes in the levels of the IGF-IR in colorectal carcinoma, we analyzed the expression of IGF-IR in 40 paired samples of normal and carcinomatous colonic tissue by quantitative reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunohistochemistry, and ligand binding. RESULTS. As measured by RT-PCR, the IGF-IR mRNA ratio in paired tumor and adjacent normal mucosa was higher than 2.0 in 32 of 40 (80%) samples. The overall mean IGF-IR mRNA level was five-fold higher in tumor versus adjacent normal mucosa (P < 0.0001). Overexpression of IGF-IR in colon carcinomas was confirmed at the protein level by immunohistochemistry and receptor-binding studies. Colon carcinoma cells exhibited a positive staining for IGF-IR in 91% of all tumors (30 of 33) whereas the adjacent normal colonic epithelial cells showed only a very faint or no significant IGF-IR immunoreactivity. Radioligand assays and Scatchard analysis in both tissue types revealed a single class of high-affinity IGF-IR-binding sites with a similar dissociation constant (K-d; 0.14 +/- 0.02 nmol/L, n = 18). However, specific (125)IGF-I-binding and receptor concentrations were elevated in tumor membranes compared with normal mucosa (33.6 +/- 5.6 vs. 22.7 +/- 3.4 fmol/mg protein, P < 0.05). IGF-I affinity crosslinking and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis displayed specific bands corresponding to the size of the normal alpha-subunit of the IGF-IR that were more intense in carcinomatous samples. IGF-II mRNA levels were significantly elevated in colorectal carcinomas (P < 0.0001). The IGF-II mRNA ratio in tumor versus normal tissue was elevated more than twofold in 28 of 40 paired samples and a positive correlation was observed between the overexpression of IGF-II and IGF-IR in the tumors. CONCLUSIONS. Our results demonstrate that, in addition to IGF-II, a strong overexpression of IGF-IR is found in the majority of colorectal carcinomas, supporting the hypothesis of an important role of the IGF system in the pathogenesis of colorectal carcinoma.

Specific binding sites for Tyr-Ala-hexarelin were detected in membranes from non-tumoral and follicular-derived neoplastic thyroid tissue, but not in thyroid tumours (medullary carcinomas) of parafollicular (C cell) origin. The binding activity was greatest in well differentiated neoplasms (papillary and follicular carcinomas), followed by poorly differentiated carcinomas, non-tumoral thyroid parenchyma, follicular adenomas and anaplastic carcinomas. Both peptidyl (Tyr-Ala-hexarelin, hexarelin, growth hormone releasing peptide (GHRP6) and non-peptidyl (MK 0677) GHSs completely displaced the radioligand from binding sites of non-tumoral thyroid gland, but MK 0677 was significantly less potent. The IC50 values were (1.9 +/- 0.3) x 10(-8) mol/l for Tyr-Ala-hexarelin, (2.1 +/- 0.2) x 10(-8) mol/l for hexarelin, (2.4 +/- 0.3) x 10-8 mol/l for GHRP6 and only (1.5 +/- 0.4) x 10(-7) mol/l for MK 0677. Similar IC50 values were found in neoplastic thyroid tissue. Scatchard analysis of the binding revealed a finite number of binding sites in non-tumoral (B-max: 1232 +/- 32 fmol/mg protein, n = 3) and neoplastic (papillary carcinomas) thyroid tissue (B-max 2483 +/- 380 fmol/mg protein, n = 5), with dissociation constants (K-d) Of (3.8 +/- 0.3) x 10(-9) and (4.4 +/- 0.6) x 10(-9) mol/l, respectively. On the basis of this evidence, Ne investigated the effects of some GHS on the proliferation of three different human follicular thyroid carcinoma cell lines (NPA, WRO and ARO) in which the presence of specific GHS receptors was also demonstrated.. Tyr-Ala-hexarelin, GHRP6 and MK 0677 were able to inhibit serum-stimulated [H-3]thymidine incorporation in NPA cells at concentrations close to their binding affinity. These substances also caused a significant inhibition of cell proliferation, which was evident at the earliest time of treatment (24 h) in all the cell lines, and at the latest time (96 h) in NPA cells only. In conclusion, this paper confirms the existence of specific binding sites for GHS in normal thyroid tissue and demonstrates, for the first time, that these binding sites are present in papillary and follicular carcinomas, low in anaplastic carcinomas and absent in medullary carcinomas of the thyroid. This work also provides evidence of a growth-inhibitory effect of GHS on cell lines derived from follicular thyroid cancers.

We here report the enantiopharmacology of 2-Me-Tet-AMPA in radioligand binding and cortical wedge electrophysiological assay systems, and using cloned AMPA (GluR1-4) and kainic acid (KA) (GluR5, 6, and KA2) receptor subtypes expressed in Xenopus oocytes. 2-Me-Tet-AMPA was resolved using preparative chiral HPLC. Zwitterion (-)-2-Me-Tet-AMPA was assigned the (R)-configuration based on an X-ray crystallographic analysis supported by the elution order of (-)- and (+)-2-Me-Tet-AMPA using four different chiral HPLC columns and by circular dichroism spectra. None of the compounds tested showed detectable affinity for N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor sites, and (R)-2-Me-Tet-AMPA was essentially inactive in all of the test systems used. Whereas (S)-2-Me-Tet-AMPA showed low affinity (IC50 = 11 muM) in the [H-3]KA binding assay, it was significantly more potent (IC50 = 0.009 muM) than AMPA (IC50 = 0.039 muM) in the [H-3]AMPA binding assay, and in agreement with these findings, (S)-2-Me-Tet-AMPA (EC50 = 0.11 muM) was markedly more potent than AMPA (EC50 = 3.5 muM) in the electrophysiological cortical wedge model. In contrast to AMPA, which showed comparable potencies (EC50 = 1.3-3.5 muM) at receptors formed by the AMPA receptor subunits (GluR1-4) in Xenopus oocytes, more potent effects and a substantially higher degree of subunit selectivity were observed for (S)-2-Me-Tet-AMPA: GluR1o (EC50 = 0.16 muM), GluR1o/GluR2i (EC50 = 0.12 muM), GluR3o (EC50 = 0.014 muM) and GluR4o (EC50 = 0.009 muM). At the KA-preferring receptors GluR5 and GluR6/KA2, (S)-2-Me-Tet-AMPA showed much weaker agonist effects (EC50 = 8.1 and 15.3 muM, respectively). It is concluded that (S)2-Me-Tet-AMPA is a subunit-selective and highly potent AMPA receptor agonist and a potentially useful tool for studies of physiological AMPA receptor subtypes.

Image Quantification for TSPO PET with a Novel Image-Derived Input Function Method	DIAGNOSTICS			English	Article						TSPO PET; neuroinflammation; image-derived input function; kinetic modeling analysis	TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN TSPO; PARTIAL-VOLUME CORRECTION; MICROGLIAL ACTIVATION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; IN-VIVO; RADIOLIGAND BINDING; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; GRAPHICAL ANALYSIS; REFERENCE REGION; HEALTHY HUMANS	There is a growing interest in using F-18-DPA-714 PET to study neuroinflammation and microglial activation through imaging the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO). Although quantification of F-18-DPA-714 binding can be achieved through kinetic modeling analysis with an arterial input function (AIF) measured with blood sampling procedures, the invasiveness of such procedures has been an obstacle for wide application. To address these challenges, we developed an image-derived input function (IDIF) that noninvasively estimates the arterial input function from the images acquired for F-18-DPA-714 quantification. Methods: The method entails three fully automatic steps to extract the IDIF, including a segmentation of voxels with highest likelihood of being the arterial blood over the carotid artery, a model-based matrix factorization to extract the arterial blood signal, and a scaling optimization procedure to scale the extracted arterial blood signal into the activity concentration unit. Two cohorts of human subjects were used to evaluate the extracted IDIF. In the first cohort of five subjects, arterial blood sampling was performed, and the calculated IDIF was validated against the measured AIF through the comparison of distribution volumes from AIF (V-T(,AIF)) and IDIF (V-T(,)IDIF). In the second cohort, PET studies from twenty-eight healthy controls without arterial blood sampling were used to compare V-T(,)IDIF with V-T(,)REF measured using a reference region-based analysis to evaluate whether it can distinguish high-affinity (HAB) and mixed-affinity (MAB) binders. Results: In the arterial blood-sampling cohort, VT derived from IDIF was found to be an accurate surrogate of the VT from AIF. The bias of V-T(,)IDIF was -5.8 +/- 7.8% when compared to V-T(,AIF), and the linear mixed effect model showed a high correlation between V-T(,AIF) and V-T(,)IDIF (p < 0.001). In the nonblood-sampling cohort, V-T(,)IDIF showed a significance difference between the HAB and MAB healthy controls. V-T(,)IDIF and standard uptake values (SUV) showed superior results in distinguishing HAB from MAB subjects than V-T(,)REF. Conclusions: A novel IDIF method for F-18-DPA-714 PET quantification was developed and evaluated in this study. This IDIF provides a noninvasive alternative measurement of V-T to quantify the TSPO binding of F-18-DPA-714 in the human brain through dynamic PET scans.

PET tracers are needed for imaging of this receptor system in vivo. Methods: High-specific-activity C-11-ORM-13070 (1-[(S)-1-(2,3-dihydrobenzo[1,4]dioxin-2-yl)methyl]-4-(3-C-11-methoxy-methylpyridin-2-yl)-piperazine) was synthesized by C-11-methylation of O-desmethyl-ORM-13070 with C-11-methyl triflate, which was prepared from cyclotron-produced C-11-methane via C-11-methyl iodide. Rats and mice were investigated in vivo with PET and ex vivo with autoradiography. The specificity of C-11-ORM-13070 binding to alpha(2) adrenoceptors was demonstrated in rats pretreated with atipamezole, an alpha(2) adrenoceptor antagonist. The alpha(2C) adrenoceptor selectivity of the tracer was determined by comparing tracer binding in wild-type and alpha(2A)- and alpha(2AC) adrenoceptor knockout (KO) mice. C-11-ORM-13070 and its radioactive metabolites in rat plasma and brain tissue were analyzed with radio-high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy. Human radiation dose estimates were extrapolated from rat biodistribution data. Results: The radiochemical yield, calculated from initial cyclotron-produced C-11-methane, was 9.6% +/- 2.7% (decay-corrected to end of bombardment). The specific activity of the product was 640 +/- 390 GBq/pmol (decay-corrected to end of synthesis). The radiochemical purity exceeded 99% in all syntheses. The highest levels of tracer binding were observed in the striatum and olfactory tubercle of rats and control and alpha(2A) KO mice that is, in the brain regions known to contain the highest densities of an adrenoceptors. In rats pretreated with atipamezole and in alpha(2AC) KO mice, C-11 tracer binding in the striatum and olfactory tubercle was low, similar to that of the frontal cortex and thalamus, regions with low densities of alpha(2C) adrenoceptors. Two radioactive metabolites were found in rat plasma, but only one of them was found in the brain; their identity was not revealed. The estimated effective radiation dose was comparable with the average exposure level in PET studies with C-11 tracers. Conclusion: An efficient method for the radiosynthesis of C-11-ORM-13070 was developed. C-11-ORM-13070 emerged as a potential novel radiotracer for in vivo imaging of brain alpha(2C) adrenoceptors.

Methods: Dissection was used to determine the distribution of F-18-FEAC and F-18-FEDAC in mice, whereas PET was used for a monkey. With each F-18-ligand, in vitro autoradiography and small-animal PET were performed on infarcted rat brains. Results: F-18-FEAC and F-18-FEDAC had a high uptake of radioactivity in the heart, lung, and other TSPO-rich organs of mice. In vitro autoradiography showed that the binding of each F-18-ligand significantly increased on the ipsilateral side of rat brains, compared with the contralateral side. In a small-animal PET study, PET summation images showed the contrast of radioactivity between ipsilateral and contralateral sides. Pretreatment with TSPO ligands N-benzyl-N-ethyl-2-(7-methyl-8-oxo-2-phenyl-7,8-dihydro-9H-purin-9-yl) acetamide (AC-5216) or (R)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-1(2-chlorophenyl) isoquinoline-3-carboxamide (PK11195) diminished the difference in uptake between the 2 sides. The PET study showed that each F-18-ligand had uptake and distribution patterns in the monkey brain similar to those of C-11-AC-5216. After injection into the monkey during PET, the uptake of each F-18-ligand in the brain decreased over time whereas 11C-AC-5216 did not. In the brain homogenate of mice, the percentage of the fraction corresponding to intact F-18-FEAC and F-18-FEDAC was 68% and 75% at 30 min after injection. In monkey plasma, each F-18-ligand was scarcely metabolized until the end of the PET scan. Conclusion: F-18-FEAC and F-18-FEDAC produced in vitro and in vivo signals allowing visualization of the increase in TSPO expression in the infarcted rat brain. The kinetics of both F-18-ligands in the monkey brain and tolerance for in vivo metabolism suggested their usefulness for imaging studies of TSPO in primates.

In the present study, we have evaluated the potential use of Tc-99m-EGF as a tumor targeting agent after systemic administration to Fischer rats bearing intracerebral implants of C6(EGFR) gliomas. Radiolocalization was determined following intravenous (i.v.) or intracarotid (i.c.) injection with or without hyperosmotic mannitol induced disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB-D). As determined by gamma -scintillation counting, 4 h after i.c. injection of Tc-99m-EGF, 0.34% of the injected dose per gram (% ID/g) was localized in C6(EGFR) tumors, which expressed 10(5)-10(6) EGFR sites per cell, compared to 0.07% ID/g in animals bearing C6 wildtype gliomas, which do not express EGFR. The corresponding tumor to brain ratios were 5.6 and 1.6, respectively. Tumors could be visualized by external gamma -scintigraphy in rats bearing C6(EGFR) but not C6 wildtype gliomas, thereby establishing that radiolocalization was dependent upon receptor expression. Intracarotid administration of Tc-99m-EGF significantly increased tumor uptake compared to i.v. injection (0.34 vs 0.14% ID/g, p<0.04). BBB-D disruption, followed by i.c. injection of Tc-99m-EGF, however, did not significantly enhance tumor uptake compared to i.c. injection without BBB-D (0.45% vs 0.34% ID/g, p>0.1). The uptake of Tc-99m-EGF was similar to4-9% ID/g in the liver and 12-20% ID/g in the kidneys after i.c. or i.v. administration. External gamma -scintigraphy of regions of interest over the liver and kidneys revealed that similar to 70-80% of the whole body radioactivity accumulated in these organs, and only 0.47-0.83% in the tumor following i.v. or i.c. administration of Tc-99m-EGF. Our study has demonstrated that EGF can be used as a specific targeting agent for EGFR (+) rat brain tumors. However, it is unlikely that systemic injection of EGF-based bioconjugates can deliver sufficient amounts of the ligand to brain tumors for therapeutic purposes and direct delivery by means of either intratumoral injection or a variant of it such as convection enhanced delivery will be required.

However, as a relevant number of SCLC patients show a high expression of somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), SSTR-targeted radionuclide therapy (PRRT) may be a treatment option. Therefore, we investigated whether SSTR expression assessed in positron emission tomography (PET) has prognostic value. In patients with adequate PET uptake, PRRT was performed, and the outcome was investigated. We found that SSTR-targeted PET, although not a prognostic tool for outcome, is an important tool for treatment decision. In some patients, PRRT can be a promising treatment option as a second or third line treatment of SCLC. Background: Given the dismal prognosis of small cell lung cancer (SCLC), novel therapeutic targets are urgently needed. We aimed to evaluate whether SSTR expression, as assessed by positron emission tomography (PET), can be applied as a prognostic image biomarker and determined subjects eligible for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT). Methods: A total of 67 patients (26 females; age, 41-80 years) with advanced SCLC underwent SSTR-directed PET/computed tomography (somatostatin receptor imaging, SRI). SRI-avid tumor burden was quantified by maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) and tumor-to-liver ratios (T/L) of the most intense SCLC lesion. Scan findings were correlated with progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS). In addition, subjects eligible for SSTR-directed radioligand therapy were identified, and treatment outcome and toxicity profile were recorded. Results: On a patient basis, 36/67 (53.7%) subjects presented with mainly SSTR-positive SCLC lesions (>50% lesions positive); in 10/67 patients (14.9%), all lesions were positive. The median SUVmax was found to be 8.5, while the median T/L was 1.12. SRI-uptake was not associated with PFS or OS, respectively (SUVmax vs. PFS, & rho; = 0.13 with p = 0.30 and vs. OS, & rho; = 0.00 with p = 0.97; T/L vs. PFS, & rho; = 0.07 with p = 0.58 and vs. OS, & rho; = -0.05 with p = 0.70). PRRT was performed in 14 patients. One patient succumbed to treatment-independent infectious complications immediately after PRRT. In the remaining 13 subjects, disease control was achieved in 5/13 (38.5%) with a single patient achieving a partial response (stable disease in the remainder). In the sub-group of responding patients, PFS and OS were 357 days and 480 days, respectively. Conclusions: SSTR expression as detected by SRI is not predictive of outcome in patients with advanced SCLC. However, it might serve as a therapeutic target in selected patients.

In [1](+), two pyridyl rings coordinate to the metal via a Au-C bond ((CNNC)-N-boolean AND-N-boolean AND-C-boolean AND coordination) and the two noncoordinated amine bridges of the ligand remain protonated, while in [2](+) all four pyridyl rings of the ligand coordinate to the metal via a Au-N bond ((NNNN)-N-boolean AND-N-boolean AND-N-boolean AND coordination), but both amine bridges are deprotonated. As a result, both complexes are monocationic, which allowed comparison of the sole effect of cyclometalation on the chemistry, protein interaction, and anticancer properties of the gold(III) compounds. Due to their identical monocationic charge and similar molecular shape, both complexes [1]Cl and [2]Cl displaced reference radioligand [H-3]dofetilide equally well from cell membranes expressing the K(v)11.1 (hERG) potassium channel, and more so than the tetrapyridyl ligands H(2)biqbpy1 and H(2)biqbpy2. By contrast, cyclometalation rendered [1]Cl coordinatively stable in the presence of biological thiols, while [2]Cl was reduced by a millimolar concentration of glutathione into metastable Au(I) species releasing the free ligand H(2)biqbpy2 and TrxR-inhibiting Au+ ions. The redox stability of [1]Cl dramatically decreased its thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) inhibition properties, compared to [2]Cl. On the other hand, unlike [2]Cl, [1]Cl aggregated into nanoparticles in FCS-containing medium, which resulted in much more efficient gold cellular uptake. [1]Cl had much more selective anticancer properties than [2]Cl and cisplatin, as it was almost 10 times more cytotoxic to human cancer cells (A549, A431, A375, and MCF7) than to noncancerous cells (MRC5). Mechanistic studies highlight the strikingly different mode of action of the two compounds: while for [1]Cl high gold cellular uptake, nuclear DNA damage, and interaction with hERG may contribute to cell killing, for [2]Cl extracellular reduction released TrxR-inhibiting Au+ ions that were taken up in minute amounts in the cytosol, and a toxic tetrapyridyl ligand also capable of binding to hERG. These results demonstrate that bis-cyclometalation is an appealing method to improve the redox stability of Au(III) compounds and to develop gold-based cytotoxic compounds that do not rely on TrxR inhibition to kill cancer cells.

Herein, we developed a Cu-64-labeled AlexaFluor 680-streptavidin ((AF) SAv)/biotin-based dimeric cyclic RGD peptide (RGD(2)) for hybrid PET/optical imaging of integrin alpha(V)beta(3) expression. Methods: Cu-64-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N, N', N '', N '''-tetraacetic acid (DOTA)-(AF) SAv/biotin-PEG-RGD2 was prepared by formation of a complex comprising DOTA-(AF) SAv and biotin-PEG-RGD(2), followed by radiolabeling with Cu-64. Receptor binding studies of DOTA-(AF) SAv/biotin-PEG-RGD(2) were performed using U87MG cells and I-125-RGDyK as the radioligand, and cellular uptake studies of Cu-64-DOTA-(AF) SAv/biotin-PEG-RGD(2) were also performed. MicroPET imaging followed by optical imaging of U87MG tumor-bearing mice was acquired after injection of the hybrid probe, and region of interest (ROI) analysis of tumors was performed. Ex vivo PET/optical imaging and biodistribution studies of the major tissues were performed after the in vivo imaging, and immunofluorescence staining of the tumor tissue sections was carried out. Results: Cu-64-DOTA-(AF) SAv/biotin-PEG-RGD(2) was prepared in 52.1 +/- 5.4 % radiochemical yield and with specific activity of 1.0 +/- 0.1 GBq/mg. Receptor binding studies showed that DOTA-(AF) SAv/biotin-PEG-RGD(2) had higher binding affinity for integrin alpha(V)beta(3) than RGD(2), reflecting a possible polyvalency effect. Moreover, the hybrid probe revealed time-dependent uptake by U87MG cells. In a microPET/optical imaging study, the hybrid probe demonstrated high accumulation in tumors; ROI analysis revealed 2.7 +/- 0.2 % ID/g at 1 h and 4.7 +/- 0.2 % ID/g at 21 h after injection, and subsequently acquired optical images showed tumors with strong fluorescence intensity. Ex vivo PET/optical images of the major tissues confirmed the in vivo imaging data, and biodistribution studies demonstrated high and specific uptake in tumors (4.8 +/- 0.1 % ID/g). Immunofluorescence staining showed the formation of new blood vessels in tumor tissues, suggesting that the tumor uptake was due to specific binding of the hybrid probe to integrin alpha(V)beta(3) expressed on tumor cells. Conclusions: These results indicate that a Cu-64-DOTA-(AF) SAv/biotin-PEG-RGD(2) is able to provide quantitative information on hybrid PET/optical imaging of integrin alpha(V)beta(3) expression.

Development of selective mGlu(5) agonists has been difficult, but several different positive allosteric modulator (PAM) molecules have now been identified. This study describes two novel mGlu(5) PAMs, LSN2463359 (N-(1-methylethyl)-5-(pyridin-4-ylethynyl)pyridine-2-carboxamide) and LSN2814617 [(7S)-3-tert-butyl-7-[3-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl]-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-A]pyridine], which are useful tools for this field of research. Both compounds are potent and selective potentiators of human and rat mGlu(5) receptors in vitro, displaying curve shift ratios of two to three fold in the concentration-response relationship to glutamate or the glutamate receptor agonist, DHPG, with no detectable intrinsic agonist properties. Both compounds displaced the mGlu(5) receptor antagonist radioligand, [H-3]MPEP in vitro and, following oral administration reached brain concentrations sufficient to occupy hippocampal mGlu(5) receptors as measured in vivo by dose-dependent displacement from the hippocampus of intravenously administered MPEPy. In vivo EEG studies demonstrated that these mGlu(5) PAMs have marked wake-promoting properties but little in the way of rebound hypersomnolence. In contrast, the previously described mGlu(5) PAMs CDPPB and ADX47273 showed relatively poor evidence of in vivo target engagement in either receptor occupancy assays or EEG disturbance. Wake-promoting doses of LSN2463359 and LSN2814617 attenuated deficits in performance induced by the competitive NMDA receptor antagonist SDZ 220,581 in two tests of operant behaviour: the variable interval 30 s task and the DMTP task. These effects were lost if the dose of either compound extended into the range which disrupted performance in the baseline DMTP task. However, the improvements in response accuracy induced by the mGlu(5) potentiators in SDZ 220,581-treated rats were not delay-dependent and, therefore, perhaps more likely reflected optimization of general arousal than specific beneficial effects on discrete cognitive processes. The systematic profiling of LSN2463359 and LSN2814617 alongside other previously described molecules will help determine more precisely how mGlu(5) potentiator pharmacology might provide therapeutic benefit.

Compounds with unsubstituted or Substituted ethylene spacer to an aromatic ring were synthesized. Additionally variations in the spacer-elongation of the linker containing more than two atoms. introduction of a double bond or heteroatoms were performed. Physicochemical properties of the synthesized compounds were described. The obtained compounds envisaged as sterically fixed and configurationally stable analogs of 8-styrylxanthines. were evaluated for their affinity to adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptors, the receptor subtypes that are predominant in the brain. Selected compounds were also investigated for the affinity to the A(2B) and A(3) receptor subtypes. It was stated that phenylethyl pyrimido[2,1-integral]purinediones and their analogs with variations of the ethylene spacer (substituted or extended) exhibit micromolar or submicromolar affinity for A(2A) ARs (adenosine receptors); for example compound 2Ac with p-hydroxy substituent displayed a K-i value of 0.23 mu M at the rat A(2A) receptor. In comparison to the previously obtained phenyl and benzyl pyrimido[2,1-integral]purinediones compounds with a shorter spacer, phenethyl derivatives were optimal for A(2A) AR. The kind of substituent at the aromatic ring was important for the affinity. Oxygen and nitrogen atoms in the spacer resulted frequently in a slight decrease of the A(2A) AR affinity, introduction of more heteroatoms into the spacer-in carbamates-caused distinctly negative effect on the activity. In this series of compounds more frequently the adenosine A, activity was observed, also in submicromolar range as for dipropyl derivative 2Ba, with K, value of 0.62 mu M at the rat A(2A) AR. 3D-QSAR models were developed for the compounds presented in this paper as well as in the previous publications showing activity at adenosine A I and A2A ARs. It was concluded that for the activity at adenosine A I and A(2A) receptors lipophilicity, steric effects along with the molecule's electrostatic surface properties had greatest value. Chosen compounds were evaluated in vivo as anticonvulsants in MES, scMet tests and examined for neurotoxicity. Contrary to previously obtained phenyl and benzyl pyrimido[2, 1-integral] purinediones, all tested compounds were inactive as anticonvulsants. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We investigated the effects of alpha -MSH, alpha -MSH(1-10), and alpha -MSH(11-13) on NO production and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) translocation in RAW 264.7 macrophages. After stimulation of the cells with bacterial lipopolysaccharide/interferon-gamma (LPS/IFN-gamma), all three peptides inhibited NO production with an order of potency alpha -MSH greater than or equal to alpha -MSH(11-13), alpha -MSH(1-10). All three MSH peptides inhibited NF-kappaB nuclear translocation with the maximal effect of alpha -MSH and alpha -MSH(11-13) being seen in the range 1 nM-1 muM, and that of alpha -MSH(1-10) at 1 muM. By use of I-125-(Nle(4),D-Phe(7))alpha -MSH(NDP-MSH) radioligand binding, MC1 receptor-binding sites were demonstrated on RAW 264.7 cells. alpha -MSH and alpha -MSH(1-10) competed with the I-125-NDP-MSH binding at these MC1 receptor-binding sites, but alpha -MSH(11-13) even in concentrations up to 1 mM did not. Moreover, alpha -MSH and alpha -MSH(1-10) caused powerful stimulation of cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in the RAW 264.7 cell, whereas alpha -MSH(11-13) was ineffective. Forskolin stimulated cAMP and inhibited NO production to the same extent as alpha -MSH and alpha -MSH(1-10), but did not modify the translocation of NF-kappaB. Whereas the protein kinase A inhibitor H89 did not modify the effect of alpha -MSH on NF-kappaB translocation, H89 caused a partial inhibition of the inhibitory effect of alpha -MSH, alpha -MSH(1-10), alpha -MSH(11-13), and forskolin on NO production. In addition alpha -MSH, alpha -MSH(1-10), alpha -MSH(11-13), and forskolin also inhibited the activity of an NF-kappaB-dependent luciferase reporter and these effects were partially counteracted by H89. We suggest that melanocortin peptides act via dual mechanisms of action: one cAMP-independent and causing linhibition of NF-kappaB translocation and the other dependent on MC1 receptor/cAMP activation.

We propose a new technique to estimate the internal radiation dose in PET studies by means of multiple D-shuttle dosimeters attached on the body surface of the patient. MethodsRadioactivity in a source organ was estimated iteratively using measurements from multiple D-shuttle dosimeters with a maximum-likelihood expectation-maximization (MLEM) algorithm with dose response from a source to a D-shuttle dosimeter computed by Monte Carlo simulation. To validate our technique, we performed a phantom study using a National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) body phantom. The fillable compartments (torso cavity and six spheres) of the phantom were filled with F-18-FDG mixed with pure water using an 800:1 sphere-to-background radioactivity concentration ratio. The radioactivity concentrations present in the torso cavity and six spheres were 0.00165 MBq/mL and 1.32 MBq/mL, respectively. The initial radioactivities of the torso cavity and six spheres (treated as source organs) were 15.9 MBq (torso cavity), 34.7 MBq (37 mm sphere), 15.1 MBq (28 mm sphere), 7.27 MBq (22 mm sphere), 3.26 MBq (17 mm sphere), 1.54 MBq (13 mm sphere), and 0.697 MBq (10 mm sphere). Eleven D-shuttle dosimeters were attached to the NEMA body phantom surface to obtain information on body surface dose and a mathematical NEMA body phantom has been modeled in the Heavy Ion Transport Code System (PHITS) Monte Carlo simulation code. ResultsRadioactivity was estimated in 2 min intervals over a 110-min total dose time using our proposed technique. A significant correlation (R-2 = 0.992) was found between actual radioactivity and estimated radioactivity at every 2 min interval for each source organ. The estimated initial radioactivity (mean with standard deviation) was 16.5 0.311 MBq (torso cavity), 33.0 +/- 0.624 MBq (37 mm sphere), 15.7 +/- 0.189 MBq (28 mm sphere), 7.11 +/- 0.738 MBq (22 mm sphere), 4.17 +/- 0.083 MBq (17 mm sphere), 1.48 +/- 0.469 MBq (13 mm sphere), and 0.865 +/- 0.313 MBq (10 mm sphere), which were very close to the actual initial radioactivity measurements for each source organ. ConclusionsThe phantom study showed that our technique worked successfully. This technique could be used to estimate internal radiation dosimetry in a clinical PET study.	[Islam, Md.

AV-45-A16 Study Grp	Cerebral PET with florbetapir compared with neuropathology at autopsy for detection of neuritic amyloid-β plaques: a prospective cohort study	LANCET NEUROLOGY			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; F 18; ASSOCIATION; RADIOLIGAND	Background Results of previous studies have shown associations between PET imaging of amyloid plaques and amyloid-beta pathology measured at autopsy. However, these studies were small and not designed to prospectively measure sensitivity or specificity of amyloid PET imaging against a reference standard. We therefore prospectively compared the sensitivity and specificity of amyloid PET imaging with neuropathology at autopsy. Methods This study was an extension of our previous imaging-to-autopsy study of participants recruited at 22 centres in the USA who had a life expectancy of less than 6 months at enrolment. Participants had autopsy within 2 years of PET imaging with florbetapir (F-18). For one of the primary analyses, the interpretation of the florbetapir scans (majority interpretation of five nuclear medicine physicians, who classified each scan as amyloid positive or amyloid negative) was compared with amyloid pathology (assessed according to the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease standards, and classed as amyloid positive for moderate or frequent plaques or amyloid negative for no or sparse plaques); correlation of the image analysis results with amyloid burden was tested as a coprimary endpoint. Correlation, sensitivity, and specificity analyses were also done in the subset of participants who had autopsy within 1 year of imaging as secondary endpoints. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT 01447719 (original study NCT 00857415). Findings We included 59 participants (aged 47-103 years; cognitive status ranging from normal to advanced dementia). The sensitivity and specificity of florbetapir PET imaging for detection of moderate to frequent plaques were 92% (36 of 39; 95% CI 78-98) and 100% (20 of 20; 80-100%), respectively, in people who had autopsy within 2 years of PET imaging, and 96% (27 of 28; 80-100%) and 100% (18 of 18; 78-100%), respectively, for those who had autopsy within 1 year. Amyloid assessed semiquantitatively with florbetapir PET was correlated with the post-mortem amyloid burden in the participants who had an autopsy within 2 years (Spearman p=0.76; p<0.0001) and within 12 months between imaging and autopsy (0.79; p<0.0001). Interpretation The results of this study validate the binary visual reading method approved in the USA for clinical use with florbetapir and suggest that florbetapir could be used to distinguish individuals with no or sparse amyloid plaques from those with moderate to frequent plaques. Additional research is needed to understand the prognostic implications of moderate to frequent plaque density.

Auger Electron Radioimmunotherapeutic Agent Specific for the CD123<SUP>+</SUP>/CD131<SUP>-</SUP> Phenotype of the Leukemia Stem Cell Population	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						leukemia stem cells; Auger electrons; In-111; radioimmunotherapy; micro-SPECT/CT	ACUTE MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIA; ACUTE MYELOID-LEUKEMIA; RECEPTOR-ALPHA-CHAIN; TARGETED THERAPY; MICE; AML; TRANSPLANTATION; ENGRAFTMENT; ANTIBODIES; SEQUENCES	Our aim was to construct and characterize In-111-nuclear translocation sequence (NLS)-7G3, an Auger electron-emitting radioimmunotherapeutic agent that preferentially recognizes the expression of CD123 (interleukin-3 receptor [IL-3R] alpha-subchain) in the absence of CD131 (IL-3R beta-subchain) displayed by leukemia stem cells. Methods: Monoclonal antibody 7G3 was modified with 13-mer peptides [CGYGPKKKRKVGG] harboring the NLS of SV-40 large T-antigen and with diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid for labeling with In-111. Immunoreactivity was evaluated in a competition radioligand binding assay and by flow cytometry. Nuclear localization of In-111-NLS-7G3 was studied by cell fractionation in CD123(+)/CD131(-) acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)-3, -4, and -5 cells or in primary AML or normal leukocytes. Micro-SPECT was performed in nonobese diabetic (NOD)/severe combined immune deficient (SCID) mice engrafted subcutaneously with Raji-CD123 tumors or with disseminated AML-3 or -5 cells. The cytotoxicity of In-111-NLS-7G3 on AML-5 cells was studied after 7 d in culture by trypan blue dye exclusion. DNA damage was assessed using the gamma-H2AX assay. Results: NLS-7G3 exhibited preserved CD123 immunoreactivity (affinity, 4.6 nmol/L). Nuclear importation of In-111-NLS-7G3 in AML-3, -4, or -5 cells was specific and significantly higher than unmodified In-111-7G3 and was greater in primary AML cells than in normal leukocytes. Rapid elimination of In-111-NLS-7G3 in NOD/SCID mice prevented imaging of subcutaneous Raji-CD123 tumors. This phenomenon was Fc-dependent and IgG(2a) isotype-specific and was overcome by the preadministration of excess IgG(2a) or using In-111-NLS-7G3 F(ab')(2) fragments. AML-3 and -5 cells were engrafted into the bone marrow or spleen or at extramedullary sites in NOD/SCID mice. Micro-SPECT/CT with In-111-NLS-7G3 F(ab')(2) showed splenic involvement, whereas foci of disease were seen in the spine or femur or at extramedullary sites in the brain and lymph nodes using In-111-NLS-7G3 IgG(2a). The viability of AML-5 cells was reduced by exposure in vitro to In-111-NLS-7G3; this reduction was associated with an increase in unrepaired DNA double-strand breaks. Conclusion: In-111-NLS-7G3 is a promising novel Auger electron-emitting radioimmunotherapeutic agent for AML aimed at the leukemia stem cell population. Micro-SPECT/CT was useful for visualizing the engraftment of leukemia in NOD/SCID mice.

In Vivo Imaging of Amyloid Deposition in Alzheimer Disease Using the Radioligand <SUP>18</SUP>F-AV-45 (Flobetapir F 18)	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						A beta; PET; Alzheimer disease; dementia; biomarkers; aging; F-18	SPATIAL CONSTRAINT; COGNITIVE DECLINE; PET; DIAGNOSIS; BETA; NEUROPATHOLOGY; CONSORTIUM; ESTABLISH; REGISTRY; CERAD	An F-18-labeled PET amyloid-beta (A beta) imaging agent could facilitate the clinical evaluation of late-life cognitive impairment by providing an objective measure for Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology. Here we present the results of a clinical trial with (E)-4-(2-(6-(2-(2-(2-F-18-fluoroethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)pyridin-3-yl) vinyl)-N-methyl benzenamine (F-18-AV-45 or flobetapir F 18). Methods: An open-label, multicenter brain imaging, metabolism, and safety study of F-18-AV-45 was performed on 16 patients with AD (Mini-Mental State Examination score, 19.3 +/- 3.1; mean age +/- SD, 75.8 +/- 9.2 y) and 16 cognitively healthy controls (HCs) (Mini-Mental State Examination score, 29.8 +/- 0.45; mean age +/- SD, 72.5 +/- 11.6 y). Dynamic PET was performed over a period of approximately 90 min after injection of the tracer (370 MBq [10 mCi]). Standardized uptake values and cortical-to-cerebellum standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were calculated. A simplified reference tissue method was used to generate distribution volume ratio (DVR) parametric maps for a subset of subjects. Results: Valid PET data were available for 11 AD patients and 15 HCs. F-18-AV-45 accumulated in cortical regions expected to be high in A beta deposition (e. g., precuneus and frontal and temporal cortices) in AD patients; minimal accumulation of the tracer was seen in cortical regions of HCs. The cortical-to-cerebellar SUVRs in AD patients showed continual substantial increases through 30 min after administration, reaching a plateau within 50 min. The 10-min period from 50 to 60 min after administration was taken as a representative sample for further analysis. The cortical average SUVR for this period was 1.67 +/- 0.175 for patients with AD versus 1.25 +/- 0.177 for HCs. Spatially normalized DVRs generated from PET dynamic scans were highly correlated with SUVR (r = 0.58-0.88, P < 0.005) and were significantly greater for AD patients than for HCs in cortical regions but not in subcortical white matter or cerebellar regions. No clinically significant changes in vital signs, electrocardiogram, or laboratory values were observed. Conclusion: F-18-AV-45 was well tolerated, and PET showed significant discrimination between AD patients and HCs, using either a parametric reference region method (DVR) or a simplified SUVR calculated from 10 min of scanning 50-60 min after F-18-AV-45 administration.

Multi-graphical analysis of dynamic PET	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Gjedde-Patlak plot; Logan plot; Relative equilibrium; RE plot; PET	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; BRAIN TRANSFER CONSTANTS; 5-HT2A RECEPTORS; SPATIAL CONSTRAINT; PARAMETRIC IMAGES; LINEAR-REGRESSION; KINETIC-ANALYSIS; BINDING; QUANTIFICATION; MODEL	In quantitative dynamic PET studies, graphical analysis methods including the Gjedde-Patlak plot, the Logan plot, and the relative equilibrium-based graphical plot (RE plot) (Zhou Y., Ye W., Brasic J.R., Crabb A.H., Hilton J., Wong D.F. 2009b. A consistent and efficient graphical analysis method to improve the quantification of reversible tracer binding in radioligand receptor dynamic PET studies. Neuroimage 44(3):661-670) are based on the theory of a compartmental model with assumptions on tissue tracer kinetics. If those assumptions are violated, then the resulting estimates may be biased. In this study, a multi-graphical analysis method was developed to characterize the non-relative equilibrium effects on the estimates of total distribution volume (DVT) from the RE plot. A novel bi-graphical analysis method using the RE plot with the Gjedde-Patlak plot (RE-GP plots) was proposed to estimate DVT for the quantification of reversible tracer kinetics that may not be at relative equilibrium states during PET study period. The RE-GP plots and the Logan plot were evaluated by 19 [C-11]WIN35,428 and 10 [C-11]MDL100,907 normal human dynamic PET studies with brain tissue tracer kinetics measured at both region of interest (ROI) and pixel levels. A 2-tissue compartment model (2TCM) was used to fit ROI time activity curves (TACs). By applying multi-graphical plots to the 2TCM fitted ROI TACs which were considered as the noise-free tracer kinetics, the estimates of DVT from the RE-GP plots, the Logan plot, and the 2TCM fitting were equal to each other. For the measured ROI TACs, there was no significant difference between the estimates of the DVT from the RE-GP plots and those from 2TCM fitting (p = 0.77), but the estimates of the DVT from the Logan plot were significantly (p<0.001) lower, 2.3% on average, than those from 2TCM fitting. There was a highly linear correlation between the ROI DVT from the parametric images (Y) and those from the ROI kinetics (X) by using the RE-GP plots (Y = 1.01X + 0.23, R-2 = 0.99). For the Logan plot, the ROI estimates from the parametric images were 13% to 83% lower than those from ROI kinetics. The computational time for generating parametric images was reduced by 69% on average by the RE-GP plots in contrast to the Logan plot. In conclusion, the bigraphical analysis method using the RE-GP plots was a reliable, robust and computationally efficient kinetic modeling approach to improve the quantification of dynamic PET.

A technique to measure V-ND for ligands for the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) has recently been developed which compares the total volume of distribution (V-T) before and after administration of the TSPO ligand XBD173. Here, we used XBD173 with an occupancy plot to quantify V-ND for two TSPO radiotracers, [F-18]GE-180 and [C-11]PBR28, in cohorts of people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Additionally, we compared plots of subjects carrying high (HAB) or mixed binding (MAB) affinity polymorphisms of TSPO to estimate V-ND without receptor blockade. Procedures Twelve people with MS underwent baseline MRI and 90-min dynamic [F-18]GE-180 PET or [C-11]PBR28 PET (n = 6; three HAB, three MAB each). Arterial blood sampling was used to generate plasma input functions for the two-tissue compartment model. V-ND was calculated using two independent methods: the occupancy plot (by modelling the differences in signal post XBD173) and the polymorphism plot (by modelling the differences in signal across presence and absence of rs6971 genotypes). Results Whole brain V-T (mean +/- standard deviation) was 0.29 +/- 0.17 ml/cm(3) for [F-18]GE-180 and 5.01 +/- 1.88 ml/cm(3) for [C-11]PBR28. Using the occupancy and polymorphism plots respectively, V-ND for [F-18]GE-180 was 0.11 ml/cm(3) (95 % CI = 0.02, 0.16) and 0.20 ml/cm(3) (0.16, 0.34), accounting for, on average, 55 % of V-T in the whole brain. For [C-11]PBR28, these values were 3.81 ml/cm(3) (3.02, 4.21) and 3.49 ml/cm(3) (1.38, 4.27), accounting for 67 % of average whole brain V-T. Conclusions Although V-T for [F-18]GE-180 is low, indicating low brain penetration, half the signal shown by MS subjects reflected specific TSPO binding. V-T for [C-11]PBR28 was higher and two thirds of the binding was non-specific. No brain ROIs were devoid of specific signal, further confirming that true reference tissue approaches are potentially problematic for estimating TSPO levels.

Methods: Radioligand binding assay was performed on human adenosine receptors (A(2B)) and assess A(2B) antagonist effect by adenylyl cyclase activity. In vitro study was carried out to determine the neutralize capacity against DPPH*, NO*, SO*, LPO* free radicals. TRP 1 at the doses 1 mg/kg bd.wt. and 10 mg/kg bd.wt p.o, was administered consecutively for 14 days in albino rats. Ulcerative colitis was induced with single dose of 2 ml of 3% acetic acid intrarectal on 14th day in treated rats. At the end of treatment, colonic tissue was collected and subjected for estimation of macroscopic score, glutathione, catalase, MPO and inflammatory parameters such as IL 1 beta, TNF alpha and IL 6. In silico study was carried out to evaluate the binding energy and IC50 toward IL 1 beta, TNF alpha and IL 6. Results: TRP 1 was antagonized the A(2B) receptors at the concentration of 30000 nM. In vitro study was revealed that TRP1 (1 mg/ml) was significantly neutralizes the free radicals of DPPH*, SO*, NO* and LPO*. In in vivo studies, intrarectal administration of acetic acid caused significantly (***P<0.001) increased macroscopic score, colon weight, colonic MPO, IL 6, IL 1 beta and TNF-alpha (*P<0.05), while TRP 1 treated colitis rats antioxidants system such as GSH (**P<0.01), catalase (*P< 0.05) activity was significantly improved, decreases inflammatory mediators such TNF alpha (*P<0.05), IL 1 beta (*P<0.01), IL 6 (**P<0.01) and also suppresses the MPO activity (*P<0.05). In silico study was reported that the IC50 of TPR 1 against IL 1 beta, IL 6 and TNF-alpha was 7.5 mM, 28.65 mM and 45.87 mM respectively. Conclusion: Our data demonstrated that the TRP 1 treatment improved clinical score in acetic acid induced colitis in rats. It also inhibited the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6, IL 1 beta and TNF alpha and improvements of antioxidant in colitis rats through A(2B) receptor antagonist property.

Impact of Isoflurane Anesthesia on D2 Receptor Occupancy by [<SUP>18</SUP>F]fallypride Measured by MicroPET With a Modified Logan Plot	SYNAPSE			English	Article						[F-18]fallypride; dopamine (DA) receptors; isoflurane; graphical analysis; microPET	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; DOPAMINE RELEASE; RAT-BRAIN; NONHUMAN-PRIMATES; IN-VIVO; BINDING; PET; RADIOLIGAND; STRIATUM; REGIONS	In the previous work, we reported a method that utilized imaging data collected from 60 to 120 min following [F-18] fallypride administration to estimate the distribution volume ratio DVR' (DVR' proportional to DVR; DVR = 1 + BPND, where BPND is a measure of receptor density, DA D2 in this case). In this work, we use this method to assess the effects of isoflurane anesthesia on [F-18] fallypride DVR'. Methods: Rats were injected with [F-18] fallypride either unconsciously under similar to 1.5% isoflurane via the tail vein (Group 1) or consciously via a catheter inserted either in the jugular vein (Group 2) or the tail vein (Group 3). After about 1 h of free access to food and water the rats were anesthetized with 1.5% isoflurane and imaged in a microPET for 60 min. The rats that were injected consciously (Groups 2 and 3) were placed in a rat restrainer during [F-18]fallypride injection. They were habituated in that restrainer for 3 days prior to the experiment day to minimize restraint-related stress. For comparison, a control group of rats was imaged for 120 min simultaneously with the administration of [F-18]fallypride i.v. while under 1.5% isoflurane. The DVR' estimates from the 60 min acquisitions were compared with the DVR' from the last 60 min of the 120 min acquisitions (after neglecting the first 60 min). In addition, the striatal time-activity curves were fit with a 2-tissue + plasma compartment model using an arbitrary simulated plasma input function to obtain k(3)/k(4) (approximate to BPND) for the 60 and 120 min acquisitions. Results: Isoflurane anesthesia caused a significant reduction, up to 22%, in the DVR' estimates, which were 15.7 +/- 0.3 (mean +/- SE) for the controls, 17.7 +/- 0.3 for Group 1, 19.2 +/- 0.4 for Group 2, and 18.8 +/- 0.7 for Group 3. The compartmental model fit produced similar results, similar to 30% reduction in k(3)/k(4) for the 120-min acquisitions compared with the 60-min acquisitions (initial conscious uptake of the radiotracer). Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrate that isoflurane anesthesia significantly decreases striatal [F-18] fallypride BPND in rats. Of similar importance, this work demonstrates the effectiveness of delayed scans following radiotracer injection and the implication that different types of studies can be conducted simultaneously with this method, including studies of behavioral and environmental impact on brain receptors.

Nutt.; black cohosh; serotonin receptor; hot flashes; estrogen receptor	CIMICIFUGA-RACEMOSA; HOT FLASHES; POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN; ESTROGENIC ACTIVITY; EXTRACT BNO-1055; PILOT EVALUATION; HORMONE-RELEASE; MENOPAUSAL; THERAPY; EXPRESSION	Extracts of the rhizome of black cohosh [Actaea racemosa L., formerly called Cimicifuga racemosa (L.) Nutt.] were evaluated for potential mechanisms of action in the alleviation of menopausal hot flashes. Ovariectomized Sprague-Dawley rats were administered a 40% 2-propanol extract of black cohosh [4, 40, and 400 mg/(kg.day)] by gavage for 2 weeks with or without estradiol [50 mug/(kg-day)] to determine if black cohosh could act as an estrogen or antiestrogen on the basis of an increase in uterine weight or vaginal cellular cornification. No effects were observed on uterine weight or on vaginal cellular cornification in rats treated with black cohosh alone or in combination with 17beta-estradiol, indicating this black cohosh extract had no estrogenic or antiestrogenic properties in the ovariectomized rat model. To evaluate other potential pathways by which black cohosh might reduce menopausal hot flashes, serotonin activity was first assessed by the inhibition of radioligand binding to cell membrane preparations containing recombinant human serotonin receptor (5-HT) subtypes. A 40% 2-propanol extract of black cohosh was tested against 10 subtypes of the serotonin receptor, revealing the presence of compounds with strong binding to the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1D, and 5-HT7 subtypes. Subsequent binding studies were carried out using 5-HT1A and 5-HT7 receptors because of their association with the hypothalamus, which has been implicated in the generation of hot flashes. The black cohosh 40% 2-propanol extract inhibited [H-3]lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) binding to the human 5-HT7 receptor (IC50 = 2.4 +/- 0.4 mug/mL) with greater potency than binding of [H-3]-8-hydroxy-2-(di-N-propylamino)tetralin to the rat 5-HT1A receptor (IC50 = 13.9 +/- 0.6 mug/mL). Analysis of ligand binding data indicated that components of a black cohosh methanol extract functioned as a mixed competitive ligand of the 5-HT7 receptor. In addition, a black cohosh methanol extract elevated cAMP levels in 293T-5-HT7-transfected HEK cells, suggesting the extract acted as a partial agonist at the receptor. The elevation in cAMP mediated by the black cohosh extract could be reversed in the presence of the antagonist methiothepin, indicating a receptor-mediated process. These data suggest that reductions in hot flashes in some women taking black cohosh may not be due to estrogenic properties. This study identifies other possible biological targets of black cohosh that could account for reported biological effects.

To further characterize mutual adaptations of these two receptor subtypes in the absence of one of them, activation of G-protein coupling by agonist was measured and compared to wildtype (WT) in 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B homozygous knockout (KO) mice. As expected, in WT, the non-selective 5-HT1A/1B receptor agonist 5-carboxyamidotryptamine (5-CT) Stimulated guanosine 5'-O-(gamma-[S-35]thio)triphosphate ([S-35]GTP(gamma)S) incorporation in many brain regions endowed with one and/or the other receptor, In the respective KOs. no stimulation was measured in regions known to express only or mainly the deleted receptor. In the 5-HT1A KOs, the amplitude of G-protein activation in regions endowed with 5-HT1B receptors was unchanged by comparison to WT. In the 5-HT1B KOs, the magnitude of the 5-CT stimulation was the same as WT in all regions containing 5-HT1A receptors, except in the amygdala. where it was significantly lower, even if this region was one of the most strongly activated in the WT. A similar result was obtained in the amygdala. of 5-HT1B KOs after activation by the selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist R-(+)8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT). Under these conditions, however, there was in addition a significant lowering of the stimulated (but not basal) [S-35]GTP(gamma)S incorporation by comparison to WT in all regions endowed with 5-HT1A receptors, including the dorsal raphe nucleus. Thus, eventhough agonist radioligand binding to either 5-HT1A or 5-HT1B receptors is unchanged in the reciprocal KOs. it appears that a compensatory decrease in the efficiency of G-protein coupling to 5-HT1A receptors has developed in the 5-HT1B mutant. This could represent the first indication of a crosstalk between these two 5-HT receptor subtypes, at least in brain regions where they are co localized in the same neurons.

Methods: For affinity, stability and PET measurements, H-FALGEA-NH2 was radiolabelled using 4-[F-18]fluorobenzoic acid ([F-18]FBA). The binding affinity of ([F-18]FBA)-FALGEA-NH2 was measured on EGFRvIII expressing cells, NR6M. Stability studies in vitro and in vivo were carried out in blood plasma from nude mice. PET investigations of [F-18]FBA-FALGEA-NH2 were performed on a MicroPET scanner, using seven nude mice xenografted subcutaneously with human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumours, expressing the EGFRvIII in its native form, and five nude mice xenografted subcutaneously with GBM tumours lacking EGFRvIII expression. Images of [F-18]FDG were also obtained for comparison. The mice were injected with 5-10 MBq of the radiolabelled peptide or [F-18]FDG. Furthermore, the gene expression of EGFRvIII in the tumours was determined using quantitative real-time PCR. Results: Radiolabelling and purification was achieved within 180 min, with overall radiochemical yields of 2.6-9.8% (decay-corrected) and an average specific radioactivity of 6.4 GBq/mu mol. The binding affinity (K-d) of [F-18]FBA-FALGEA-NH2 to EGFRvIII expressing cells was determined to be 23 nM. The radiolabelled peptide was moderately stable in the plasma from nude mice where 53% of the peptide was intact after 60 min of incubation in plasma but rapidly degraded in vivo, where no intact peptide was observed in plasma 5 min post-injection. The PET imaging showed that [F-18]FBA-FALGEA-NH2 accumulated preferentially in the human GBM xenografts which expressed high amounts of the mutated receptor. The average tumour-to-muscle ratio (T/M) in the EGFRvIII tumours was 7.8 at 60 min post-injection, compared with 4.6 in the wild-type EGFR tumours. Furthermore, there was a strong correlation (R=0.86, P=.007) between the expression of EGFRvIII in the tumours and the tracer uptake expressed as T/M. Conclusion: Our results indicate that, despite its rapid metabolism, [F-18]FBA-FALGEA-NH2 binds preferentially to EGFRvIII in the tumours in vivo and is a promising lead for further development of EGFRvIII specific peptide radiopharmaceuticals.

J	Gaikwad, AB; Viswanad, B; Ramarao, P				Gaikwad, Anil Bhanudas; Viswanad, Bhoomi; Ramarao, Poduri			PPARγ agonists partially restores hyperglycemia induced aggravation of vascular dysfunction to angiotensin II in thoracic aorta isolated from rats with insulin resistance	PHARMACOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						PPAR-gamma; angiotensin II; insulin resistance; thoracic aorta and hypertension	ACTIVATED-RECEPTOR-GAMMA; SMOOTH-MUSCLE-CELLS; LOWERS BLOOD-PRESSURE; OBESE ZUCKER RATS; CALCIUM-CHANNELS; ENDOTHELIAL FUNCTION; DIABETES-MELLITUS; TYPE-1 RECEPTOR; GENE-EXPRESSION; AT(1) RECEPTORS	Altered vascular responses to various vasopressors in animal models of insulin resistance (IR) and diabetes have been well documented. However, the precise mechanisms about vascular responses in IR with or without frank hyperglycemia (prediabetic state) are not available. Moreover, recently the role of peroxisome proliferators activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) has been linked to influence the vascular responses in hypertensive and diabetic state. Hence, the present study was conceived to determine the role of hyperglycemia on angiotensin II (Ang II) mediated vascular responses in the high fat diet (HFD) induced insulin resistance either with mild or frank hyperglycemia [induced by injection of low dose streptozotocin (STZ) to HFD fed rats (HFD + STZ)]. In addition, insulin-sensitizing agent such as rosiglitazone and pioglitazone were also studied on biochemical and vascular responses. Ang II-induced contractions were studied isometrically in thoracic aortic rings isolated from 4 weeks of normal pellet diet (NPD) fed control, HFD and HFD + STZ fed insulin resistant rats. Specific binding of Ang II receptors were carried out using radioligand ([H-3]-Ang II) binding studies. After 4 weeks of HFD feeding, rats exhibited characteristics features of insulin resistance such as mild hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia and hypertension; whereas HFD + STZ treated rats showed all above parameters along with frank hyperglycemia. Maximal contractile response (E-max) to Ang II is increased in HFD fed rats as compared to control rats. Moreover, Ema, values are further elevated in HFD + STZ group where the frank hyperglycemia was induced by low dose of streptozotocin. Rosiglitazone (5 mg kg(-1), p.o.) and pioglitazone (10 mg kg(-1), p.o.) treatment significantly lowered the plasma glucose, triglycerides, insulin and cholesterol levels in insulin resistance rats. In addition, it also restored the elevated systolic, mean arterial, diastolic blood pressure and attenuated the enhanced contractile responses to Ang II in thoracic aortic rings obtained from both HFD and HFD + STZ treated rats. Specific binding of [H-3-Ang II is upregulated in HFD-fed and HFD + STZ treated rats. Treatment with pioglitazone and rosiglitazone significantly decreased the AT, R specific binding in HFD fed rats. Our results indicate the role of hyperglycemia in the elevation of Ang II induced vascular responses in thoracic aorta isolated from insulin resistant rats and PPAR-gamma agonists can attenuate these responses.

Upon ligand-binding, beta-adrenoceptors are normally internalised via the arrestin pathway, and after dissociation they are re-inserted into the membrane. This means that at high catecholamine levels the adrenoceptor density is low and under beta-blockade it is high. The insertion of receptors into the membrane is often dependent on farnesylation processes that can be inhibited by statins. We carried out a prospective, controlled, observational study to determine whether beta-blockade-induced up-regulation of beta-adrenoceptor density is attenuated by statin therapy and whether this would subsequently affect catecholamine consumption during surgery. We obtained pre-operative blood samples and intra-operative biopsies of the right atrial appendage from 39 patients (age: 65 +/- 5 years; BMI: 28 +/- 1) undergoing coronary bypass surgery with or without simvastatin (20 mg/day) therapy and with or without concomitant metoprolol therapy (50 mg/day).. The atrial tissue was used for radioligand-binding studies with (-)-[I-125] (iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) and for assessment of the beta-adrenoceptor subtype distribution following standard protocols. In the blood samples, plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations were determined using HPLC. In all tissue samples, we found a total beta-adrenoceptor density of 38 +/- 4 fmol/mg protein in untreated controls; this which was up-regulated to 55 +/- 5 fmol/mg protein in patients receiving metoprolol. This increase in receptor number was nearly prevented completely by simvastatin therapy (42 +/- 5 fmol/mg protein). The up-regulation could be attributed to increases in the beta(1)-adrenoceptor subtype. In contrast, simvastatin alone had no effect on beta-adrenoceptor density. Pre-operative adrenaline levels were slightly reduced in all drug therapy groups (nonsignificant differences), while the levels noradrenaline were not significantly different among the groups. With respect to the perioperative catecholamine requirements, patients on metoprolol needed significantly less dopamine than control patients, while patients undergoing simvastatin/metoprolol therapy needed as much as the controls. The post-operative total catecholamine requirements were not different among the four groups of patients. There were no differences in plasma metoprolol concentration between patients receiving metoprolol alone and those receiving a combination of metoprolol and simvastatin. In conclusion: Simvastatin therapy seems to counter-regulate the up-regulation of beta-adrenoceptor density. In the up-regulated state induced by metoprolol therapy, the patients seemed to need less catecholamines during cardiac surgery, which may be due to the higher number of beta-adrenoceptors. Additional simvastatin therapy did not reduce post-operative catecholamine consumption.

To address these challenges, we developed and evaluated a new drug paradigm, Radio-IMmunostimulant (RIMS), in a syngeneic model of murine prostate cancer. RIMS-1 was generated using a convergent synthesis employing solid phase peptide and solution chemistries. The prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) inhibitory constant for natLu-RIMS-1 was determined, and radiolabeling with Lu-177 generated Lu-177-RIMS-1. The TLR 7/8 agonist payload release from natLu-RIMS-1 was determined using a cathepsin B assay. The biodistribution of Lu-177-RIMS-1 was evaluated in a bilateral xenograft model in NCru nude mice bearing PSMA(+) (PC3-PiP) and PSMA(-) (PC3-Flu) tumors at 2, 24, and 72 h. The therapeutic effect of 177Lu-RIMS-1 was evaluated in C57BL/6J mice bearing RM1-PGLS (PSMA-positive, green fluorescent protein-positive, and luciferase-positive) tumors and compared to that of 177Lu-PSMA-617 at the same total administered radioactivity of 57 MBq and molar activity of 5.18 MBq/nmol. natLu-RIMS-1 and vehicle were evaluated as the controls. Immuno-positron emission tomography (PET) using( 89)Zr-DFO-anti-CD3 was used to visualize T-cell distribution during treatment. 177Lu-RIMS-1 was quantitatively radiolabeled at > 99% radiochemical purity and maintained a high affinity toward PSMA (Ki = 3.77 & PLUSMN; 0.5 nM). Cathepsin B efficiently released the entire immunostimulant payload in 17.6 h. Lu-177-RIMS-1 displayed a sustained uptake in PSMA(+) tumor tissue up to 72 h (2.65 +/- 1.03% ID/g) and was not statistically different (P = 0.1936) compared to 177Lu-PSMA-617 (3.65 +/- 0.59% ID/g). All animals treated with 177Lu-RIMS-1 displayed tumor growth suppression and provided a median survival of 30 days (P = 0.0007) while 177Lu-PSMA-617 provided a median survival of 15 days, which was not statistically significant (P = 0.3548) compared to the vehicle group (14 days). ImmunoPET analysis revealed 2-fold more tumor infiltrating T-cells in 177Lu-RIMS-1-treated animals compared to 177Lu-PSMA-617-treated animals; 177Lu-RIMS-1 improves therapeutic outcomes in a syngeneic model of mouse prostate cancer and elicits greater T-cell infiltration to the tumor compared to 177Lu-PSMA-617. These results support further investigation of the RIMS paradigm as the first example of a single molecular entity combining radiotherapy and immunostimulation.

The aim of this study was to develop improved radiotherapeutic agents that combine an optimized affinity-modifying group and optimized albumin binders to maximize the tumor-to-kidney absorbed dose ratio. Methods: Ga-68-labeled DOTA-conjugated lysine-ureido-glutamate-based PSMA-targeting agents bearing various affinity-modifying groups or albumin binders were synthesized and evaluated by PET/CT imaging and biodistribution studies in LNCaP tumor-bearing mice. The optimized affinity-modifying group and albumin binders were combined, and the resulting derivatives were radiolabeled with Lu-177 and evaluated by SPECT/CT imaging and biodistribution studies in LNCaP tumor- bearing mice. Radiation dosimetry was calculated using the OLINDA/EXM software. Results: Affinity-modifying group optimization revealed that Ga-68-HTK03041 bearing a tranexamic acid-9-anthrylalanine affinity-modifying group had the highest tumor uptake (23.1 +/- 6.11 percentage injected dose [%ID]/g at 1 h after injection). Albumin binder optimization showed that Ga-68-HTK03055 and Ga-68-HTK03086 bearing the N-(4-(p-chlorophenyl)butanoyl)-Gly and N-(4-(p-methoxyphenyl)butanoyl)-Gly motifs, respectively, had relatively faster tumor accumulation (similar to 30 %ID/g at 3 h after injection) and lower average kidney uptake (<55 %ID/g at both 1 and 3 h after injection). Combining the tranexamic acid-9-anthrylalanine affinity-modifying group with N-(4-(p-chlorophenyl)butanoyl)-Gly and N-(4-(p-methoxyphenyl)butanoyl)-Gly albumin-binding motifs generated HTK03121 and HTK03123, respectively. Lu-177-HTK03121 and Lu-177-HTK03123 had extremely high peak uptake (104 +/- 20.3 and 70.8 +/- 23.7 %ID/g, respectively) in LNCaP tumor xenografts, and this peak was sustained up to 120 h after injection. Dosimetry calculation showed that compared with Lu-177-PSMA-617, Lu-177-HTK03121 and Lu-177-HTK03123 delivered 18.7- and 12.7-fold higher absorbed dose to tumor but only 6.4- and 6.3-fold higher absorbed dose to kidneys, leading to 2.9- and 2.0-fold improvement in the tumor-to-kidney absorbed dose ratios. Conclusion: With greatly enhanced tumor uptake and tumor-to-kidney absorbed dose ratio, Lu-177-HTK03121 and Lu-177-HTK03123 have the potential to improve treatment efficacy using significantly lower quantities of Lu-177 and are promising candidates for clinical translation to treat metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

In Vivo Imaging of Amyloid Deposition in Alzheimer Disease Using the Radioligand <SUP>18</SUP>F-AV-45 (Flobetapir F 18)	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						A beta; PET; Alzheimer disease; dementia; biomarkers; aging; F-18	SPATIAL CONSTRAINT; COGNITIVE DECLINE; PET; DIAGNOSIS; BETA; NEUROPATHOLOGY; RECOMMENDATIONS; CONSORTIUM; ESTABLISH; REGISTRY	An F-18-labeled PET amyloid-beta (A beta) imaging agent could facilitate the clinical evaluation of late-life cognitive impairment by providing an objective measure for Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology. Here we present the results of a clinical trial with (E)-4-(2-(6-(2-(2-(2-F-18-fluoroethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)pyridin-3-yl)vinyl)-N-methyl benzenamine (F-18-AV-45 or flobetapir F 18). Methods: An open-label, multicenter brain imaging, metabolism, and safety study of F-18-AV-45 was performed on 16 patients with AD (Mini-Mental State Examination score, 19.3 +/- 3.1; mean age +/- SD, 75.8 +/- 9.2 y) and 16 cognitively healthy controls (HCs) (Mini-Mental State Examination score, 29.8 +/- 0.45; mean age +/- SD, 72.5 +/- 11.6 y). Dynamic PET was performed over a period of approximately 90 min after injection of the tracer (370 MBq [10 mCi]). Standardized uptake values and cortical-to-cerebellum standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were calculated. A simplified reference tissue method was used to generate distribution volume ratio (DVR) parametric maps for a subset of subjects. Results: Valid PET data were available for 11 AD patients and 15 HCs. F-18-AV-45 accumulated in cortical regions expected to be high in A beta deposition (e.g., precuneus and frontal and temporal cortices) in AD patients; minimal accumulation of the tracer was seen in cortical regions of HCs. The cortical-to-cerebellar SUVRs in AD patients showed continual substantial increases through 30 min after administration, reaching a plateau within 50 min. The 10-min period from 50 to 60 min after administration was taken as a representative sample for further analysis. The cortical average SUVR for this period was 1.67 +/- 0.175 for patients with AD versus 1.25 +/- 0.177 for HCs. Spatially normalized DVRs generated from PET dynamic scans were highly correlated with SUVR (r = 0.58-0.88, P < 0.005) and were significantly greater for AD patients than for HCs in cortical regions but not in subcortical white matter or cerebellar regions. No clinically significant changes in vital signs, electrocardiogram, or laboratory values were observed. Conclusion: F-18-AV-45 was well tolerated, and PET showed significant discrimination between AD patients and HCs, using either a parametric reference region method (DVR) or a simplified SUVR calculated from 10 min of scanning 50-60 min after F-18-AV-45 administration.

Bombesin (BBN) has been known to bind to GRP receptors with high affinity and specificity. The aim of these studies was to develop new In-111-labeled BBN analogs having high tumor uptake and optimal pharmacokinetics for specific targeting of human prostate cancers. Methods: A novel series of dodecanetetraacetic acid (DOTA)-X-BBN[7-14]NH2 (X = 0, beta-Ala, 5-Ava, 8-Aoc, or 11-Aun) conjugates and their In(III)/In-111 complexes exhibiting high GRP-receptor-binding affinities were synthesized and characterized. Results: In vitro competitive binding assays, using PC-3 androgen-independent human prostate cancer cells, demonstrated values of <2.5 nmol/L for inhibitory concentration of 50% for analogs with beta-Ala, 5-Ava, and 8-Aoc spacers. In vivo biodistribution studies of the In-111-DOTA-X-BBN[7-14]NH2 conjugates performed on CF-1 mice at 1 h after injection have revealed that the uptake of radioactivity in the pancreas, a GRP-receptor-expressing tissue, increased as a function of hydrocarbon spacer length (i.e., from 0.20 +/- 0.04 percentage injected dose [%ID] per gram for the analog with no spacer to a maximum of 26.97 +/- 3.97 %ID/g for the analog with 8-Aoc spacer). The radioactivity was cleared efficiently from the blood pool by excretion mainly through the renal/urinary pathway (e.g., 71.6 +/- 1.8 %ID at 1 h after injection for 8-Aoc spacer analog). In vivo pharmacokinetic studies of the In-111-DOTA-8-Aoc-BBN[7-14]NH2 conjugate conducted on PC-3 human prostate cancer-derived xenografts in SCID mice showed a specific uptake of radioactivity in tumor, with 3.63 +/- 1.11 %ID/g observed at 1 h after injection. High tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-muscle ratios of approximately 6:1 and 45:1, respectively, were achieved at 1 h after injection. Relative to the radioactivity observed in the tumor at 1 h after injection, 43%, 19%, and 9% of the radioactivity was retained at, respectively, 24, 48, and 72 h after injection. Conclusion: These studies showed that radiometallated DOTA-X-BBN[7-14]NH2 constructs with hydrocarbon spacers ranging from 5 to 8 carbon atoms are feasible candidates for further development as diagnostic and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals for patients with GRP-positive cancers.

Predicting the effect of different folate doses on [<SUP>68</SUP>Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 organ and tumor uptake using physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling	EJNMMI RESEARCH			English	Article						[Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11; Folate; Folic acid; PSMA; PBPK model	MEMBRANE ANTIGEN; BIOCHEMICAL-CHARACTERIZATION; MONOSODIUM GLUTAMATE; RADIATION-DOSIMETRY; TISSUE DISTRIBUTION; PROSTATE-CANCER; PSMA; EXPRESSION; INHIBITOR; BINDING	BackgroundFolate intake might reduce [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 uptake in tissues due to a competitive binding to the PSMA receptor. For diagnostic imaging, this could impact decision making, while during radioligand therapy this could affect treatment efficacy. The relationship between folate dose, timing of dosing and tumor and organ uptake is not well established. The aim of this study was to develop a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model to predict the effect of folates on [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT uptake in salivary glands, kidneys and tumors.MethodsA PBPK model was developed for [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 and folates (folic acid and its metabolite 5-MTHF), with compartments added that represent salivary glands and tumor. Reactions describing receptor binding, internalization and intracellular degradation were included. Model evaluation for [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 was performed by using patient scan data from two different studies (static and dynamic), while for folates data from the literature were used for evaluation. Simulations were performed to assess the effect of different folate doses (150 mu g, 400 mu g, 5 mg and 10 mg) on accumulation in salivary glands, kidney and tumor, also for patients with different tumor volumes (10, 100, 500 and 1000 mL).ResultsFinal model evaluation showed that predictions adequately described data for both [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 and folates. Predictions of a 5-MTFH dose of 150 mu g and folic acid dose of 400 mu g (in case of administration at the same time as [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 (t = 0)) showed no clinically relevant effect on salivary glands and kidney uptake. However, the effect of a decrease in salivary glands and kidney uptake was determined to be clinically relevant for doses of 5 mg (34% decrease for salivary glands and 32% decrease for kidney) and 10 mg (36% decrease for salivary glands and 34% decrease for kidney). Predictions showed that tumor uptake was not relevantly affected by the co-administration of folate for all different folate doses (range 150 mu g-10 mg). Lastly, different tumor volumes did not impact the folate effect on [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 biodistribution.ConclusionUsing a PBPK model approach, high doses of folate (5 and 10 mg) were predicted to show a decrease of [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 salivary glands and kidney uptake, while intake by means of folate containing food or vitamin supplements showed no relevant effects. In addition, tumor uptake was not affected by folate administration in the simulated dose ranges (150 mu g-10 mg). Differences in tumor volume are not expected to impact folate effects on [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 organ uptake.	[Siebinga, Hinke; Hendrikx, Jeroen J. M. A.; Huitema, Alwin D.

As such, radiolabeled PSMA inhibitors are of great value for diagnosis and staging of this disease. Herein, we disclose the preclinical characterization of [Co-55]PSMA-617 for positron emission tomography (PET)/x-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging of prostate cancer lesions. By the application of microwave heating, PSMA-617 in acetate buffer (0.4 M, pH 4.4) was labeled with the radioisotopes cobalt-55/57. The extents of internalization and dissociation constants (K (D)) were determined against 2-(phosphonomethyl)-pentanedioic acid in two PSMA-positive cell lines, LNCaP, and PC3-PIP, with [Co-57]PSMA-617 as a surrogate for [Co-55]PSMA-617 (TA 1/2 17.5 h, beta (max) 1.5 MeV, I beta 76 %). The biodistribution in LNCaP xenograft mice was investigated using [Co-57]PSMA-617 and [Co-55]PSMA-617 was employed for PET/CT imaging at 1, 4, and 24 h and compared to PET/CT scans using [Ga-68]PSMA-617. The radiolabeling with cobalt-55/57 was performed in yields greater than 99.5 and 99.8 % and radiochemical purities of 99.7 and 98.9 %, respectively. The molar-specific activities were 18.2 MBq/nmol and 3.3 MBq/nmol. The cellular K (D) were determined to be 4.7 nM for LNCaP and 9.8 nM for PC3-PIP, correspondingly. Internalization of 76 and 71 % of the cell-associated radioactivity was found for LNCaP and PC3-PIP cells after incubation up to 240 min, respectively. In regard to the biodistribution in LNCaP xenograft mice, [Co-57]PSMA-617 displayed a high and relatively constant uptake in the tumor (12.9 %IA/g at 1 h to 10.5 %IA/g at 24 h) with an initial but transient high uptake in the kidneys, adrenals, and spleen. Tumor-to-background ratios improved over time as normal tissue cleared of the radioligand (tumor-to-blood: 26, 258, and 3013; tumor-to-kidney: 0.11, 0.28, and 4.3 at 1, 4, and 24 h). PET/CT imaging with [Co-55]PSMA-617 in xenograft mice confirmed the high tumor uptake and fast clearance of normal tissues over time and was found superior to imaging with [Ga-68]PSMA-617. Radiolabeling of PSMA-617 was achieved in excellent yields and radiochemical purities. Favorable in vitro data comprising low K (D) values and high extent of internalization was determined for two PSMA-positive cell lines. In xenograft mice, high tumor accumulation and excellent tumor-to-normal tissues ratios were established by biodistribution experiments and PET/CT imaging and, hence, confirm the potential of [Co-55]PSMA-617 for delayed clinical imaging of prostate cancer.

The aim of this study is to characterize and quantify the loss of monoamine neurons with [18F]AV-133 in the MPTP-lesioned PD mouse model using animal PET imaging and ex vivo quantitative autoradiography (QARG). Methods: Optimal imaging time window of [18F]AV-133 was first determined in normal C57BL/6 mice (n = 3) with a 90-min dynamic scan. The reproducibility of [18F]AV-133 PET imaging was evaluated by performing a testretest study within 1 week for the normal group (n = 6). For MPTP-lesioned studies, normal, and MPTP-treated [25 mg mg/kg once (Group A) and twice (Group B), respectively, daily for 5 days, i.p., groups of four normal and MPTP-treated] mice were used. PET imaging studies at baseline and at Day 4 post-MPTP injections were performed at the optimal time window after injection of 11.1 MBq [18F]AV-133. Specific uptake ratio (SUr) of [18F]AV-133 was calculated by [(target uptakecerebellar uptake)/cerebellar uptake] with cerebellum as the reference region. Ex vitro QARG and immunohistochemistry (IHC) studies with tyrosine hydroxylase antibody were carried out to confirm the abundance of dopaminergic neurons. Results: The variability between [18F]AV-133 testretest striatal SUr was 6.60 +/- 3.61% with less than 5% standard deviation between animals (intervariability). The percentages of MPTP lesions were Group A 0.94 +/- 0.29, -42.1% and Group B 0.65 +/- 0.09, -60.4%. By QARG, specific binding of [18F]AV-133 was reduced relative to the control groups by 50.6% and 60.7% in striatum and by 30.6% and 46.4% in substantia nigra (Groups A and B, respectively). Relatively small [18F]AV-133 SUr decline was noted in the serotonin and norepinephrine-enriched regions (7.9% and 9.4% in mid-brain). Results obtained from IHC consistently confirmed the sensitivity and selectivity of dopaminergic neuron loss after MPTP treatment. Conclusions: [18F]AV-133 PET SUr displayed a high testretest stability. The SUr significantly declined in the caudate putamen but not in the hypothalamus and midbrain regions after MPTP treatment in the mouse brain. The results obtained for QARG and IHC were consistent and correlated well with the PET imaging studies. On the basis of these concordant results, we find that [18F]AV-133 should serve as a useful and reliable PET tracer for evaluating nigrostriatal degeneration. Synapse 66:823831, 2012.

Comparison of in vivo binding properties of the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) ligands [<SUP>18</SUP>F]PBR102 and [<SUP>18</SUP>F]PBR111 in a model of excitotoxin-induced neuroinflammation	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						PET; Neuroinflammation; Kinetic modelling; TSPO; Micro-PIXE; [F-18]PBR102; [F-18]PBR111	PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; EXPERIMENTAL AUTOIMMUNE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; MICROGLIAL ACTIVATION; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; PROTON MICROPROBE; ELEMENTAL CHANGES; PET; BRAIN; RADIOLIGAND	The in vivo binding parameters of the novel imidazopyridine TSPO ligand [F-18]PBR102 were assessed and compared with those of [F-18]PBR111 in a rodent model of neuroinflammation. The validity of the key assumptions of the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) for estimation of binding potential (BP) was determined, with validation against a two-tissue compartment model (2TC). Acute neuroinflammation was assessed 7 days after unilateral stereotaxic administration of (R,S)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolopropionique (AMPA) in anaesthetized adult Wistar rats. Anaesthetized rats were implanted with a femoral arterial cannula then injected with a low mass of [F-18]PBR102 or [F-18]PBR111 and dynamic images were acquired over 60 min using an INVEON PET/CT camera. Another population of rats underwent the same PET protocol after pretreatment with a presaturating mass of the same unlabelled tracer (1 mg/kg) to assess the validity of the reference region for SRTM analysis. Arterial blood was sampled during imaging, allowing pharmacokinetic determination of radiotracer concentrations. Plasma activity concentration-time curves were corrected for unchanged tracer based on metabolic characterization experiments in a separate cohort of Wistar rats. The stability of neuroinflammation in both imaging cohorts was assessed by [I-125] CLINDE TSPO quantitative autoradiography, OX42/GFAP immunohistochemistry, Fluoro-Jade C histology, and elemental mapping using microparticle-induced x-ray emission spectroscopy. The BP of each ligand were assessed in the two cohorts of lesioned animals using both SRTM and a 2TC with arterial parent compound concentration, coupled with the results from the presaturation cohort for comparison and validation of the SRTM. The BPs of [F-18]PBR102 [F-18]PBR111 were equivalent, with improved signal-to-noise ratio and sensitivity compared with [C-11]PK11195. The presaturation study showed differences in the volume of distribution between the ipsilateral striatum and the striatum contralateral to the injury (0.7) indicating that an assumption of the SRTM was not met. The modelling indicated that the BPs were consistent for both ligands. Between the SRTM and 2TC model, the BPs were highly correlated, but there was a bias in BP. [F-18]PBR102 and [F-18]PBR111 have equivalent binding properties in vivo, displaying significantly greater BPs with lower signal-to-noise ratio than [C-11]PK11195. While an assumption of the SRTM was not met, this modelling approach was validated against 2TC modelling for both ligands, facilitating future use in longitudinal PET imaging of neuroinflammation.

Gordon			Evaluation of Dopamine D<sub>2/3</sub> Specific Binding in the Cerebellum for the Positron Emission Tomography Radiotracer [<SUP>11</SUP>C]FLB 457: Implications for Measuring Cortical Dopamine Release	SYNAPSE			English	Article						positron emission tomography; dopamine; D-2/3 receptors; [C-11]FLB 457; human cortex	RECEPTORS; PET; BRAIN; QUANTIFICATION; SCHIZOPHRENIA; ARIPIPRAZOLE; LIGAND; MODEL	In a recent positron emission tomography (PET) study, we demonstrated the ability to measure amphetamine-induced dopamine (DA) release in the human cortex with the DA D-2/3 radioligand [C-11]FLB 457. As previous studies in animals have shown that a relatively high fraction of the [C-11]FLB 457 signal in the cerebellum represents specific binding to D-2/3 receptors, there was concern that the use of the cerebellum as a measure of nonspecific binding (i.e., reference region) to derive [C-11]FLB 457 binding potential (BP) (BPND) would bias cortical DA release measurements. Thus, we evaluated the fractional contribution of specific binding to D-2/3 receptors in the human cerebellum for [C-11]FLB 457. Six healthy human subjects (5M/1F) were studied twice with [C-11]FLB 457, once at baseline and again following a single oral dose of 15 mg of aripiprazole, a D-2/3 partial agonist. [C-11]FLB 457 distribution volume (V-T) was estimated using kinetic analysis in the cortical regions of interest and potential reference regions. The change in [C-11]FLB 457 V-T following aripiprazole ranged from -33 to -42% in the cortical regions of interest (ROIs). The aripiprazole-induced change in [C-11]FLB 457 V-T in three potential reference regions suggests significant specific binding the cerebellum (CER, -17 +/- 12%), but not pons (PON, -10 +/- 10%) and centrum semiovale (CESVL, -3 +/- 12%). Nevertheless, a reanalysis of the published [C-11]FLB 457 test-retest and amphetamine studies suggests that the use of the PON V-T and CESVL V-T as an estimate of nonspecific binding to derive [C-11]FLB 457 BPND in DA release studies is unlikely to be successful because it leads to less reproducible outcome measures, which in turn diminishes the ability to measure DA release in the cortex. D-2/3 blocking studies with aripiprazole and [C-11]FLB 457 suggest specific binding to D-2/3 receptors in the cerebellum. These data also suggest that the contribution of specific binding to D-2/3 receptors in the cerebellum is lower than that in the cortical ROIs and that CER V-T is mostly representative of nonspecific binding. Nevertheless, caution is advised when using reference tissue methods that rely solely on the cerebellum signal as an input function to quantify [C-11]FLB 457 BPND. Synapse 65:991-997, 2011.

AV45-A07 Study Grp	Use of Florbetapir-PET for Imaging β-Amyloid Pathology	JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article							MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; PITTSBURGH COMPOUND-B; PRECLINICAL ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; BRAIN; DIAGNOSIS; DECLINE; NEUROPATHOLOGY; INDIVIDUALS; RADIOLIGAND; PREDICTION	Context The ability to identify and quantify brain beta-amyloid could increase the accuracy of a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer disease. Objective To determine if florbetapir F 18 positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging performed during life accurately predicts the presence of beta-amyloid in the brain at autopsy. Design, Setting, and Participants Prospective clinical evaluation conducted February 2009 through March 2010 of florbetapir-PET imaging performed on 35 patients from hospice, long-term care, and community health care facilities near the end of their lives (6 patients to establish the protocol and 29 to validate) compared with immunohistochemistry and silver stain measures of brain beta-amyloid after their death used as the reference standard. PET images were also obtained in 74 young individuals (18-50 years) presumed free of brain amyloid to better understand the frequency of a false-positive interpretation of a florbetapir-PET image. Main Outcome Measures Correlation of florbetapir-PET image interpretation (based on the median of 3 nuclear medicine physicians' ratings) and semiautomated quantification of cortical retention with postmortem beta-amyloid burden, neuritic amyloid plaque density, and neuropathological diagnosis of Alzheimer disease in the first 35 participants autopsied (out of 152 individuals enrolled in the PET pathological correlation study). Results Florbetapir-PET imaging was performed a mean of 99 days (range, 1-377 days) before death for the 29 individuals in the primary analysis cohort. Fifteen of the 29 individuals (51.7%) met pathological criteria for Alzheimer disease. Both visual interpretation of the florbetapir-PET images and mean quantitative estimates of cortical uptake were correlated with presence and quantity of beta-amyloid pathology at autopsy as measured by immunohistochemistry (Bonferroni rho, 0.78 [95% confidence interval, 0.58-0.89]; P<.001]) and silver stain neuritic plaque score (Bonferroni rho, 0.71 [95% confidence interval, 0.47-0.86]; P<.001). Florbetapir-PET images and postmortem results rated as positive or negative for beta-amyloid agreed in 96% of the 29 individuals in the primary analysis cohort. The florbetapir-PET image was rated as amyloid negative in the 74 younger individuals in the nonautopsy cohort. Conclusions Florbetapir-PET imaging was correlated with the presence and density of beta-amyloid. These data provide evidence that a molecular imaging procedure can identify beta-amyloid pathology in the brains of individuals during life. Additional studies are required to understand the appropriate use of florbetapir-PET imaging in the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer disease and for the prediction of progression to dementia.

The following compounds were administered orally: CP-99,994 [(+)-cis-n-[(2-methoxyphenyl) methyl]-2-phenyl-3-piperidinamine), L-742,694 [5-[[2(S)-[[3,5- bis(trifluoromethyl) phenyl] methoxy]-3(S)-phenyl-4-morpholinyl] methyl]- 2,4-dihydro- 3H-1,2,4-triazol-3-one]), MK-869 [5-[[2(R)-[1( R)-[3,5-bis( trifluoromethyl) phenyl] ethoxy]- 3(S)-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-morpholinyl] methyl]-2,4-dihydro-3H-1,2,4-triazol-3-one], CP-122,721 [cis-n-[[2-methoxy-5-(trifluoromethoxy) phenyl] methyl]- 2-phenyl-3-piperidinamine], L-760,735-F [4-[[ 2(R)-[1( R) [ 3,5- bis( trifluoromethyl) phenyl] ethoxy]- 3( S)-( 4- fluorophenyl) 4- morpholinyl] methyl]-N,N-dimethyl-1H-1,2,3-triazole-5-methanamine], GR205171 [N-[[2-methoxy-5-[ 5-( trifluoromethyl)- 1H-tetrazol-1-yl] phenyl] methy]-2(S)-phenyl-3(S) piperidinamine], L-733,060 [(2S,3S) 3-([3,5-bis( trifluoro methyl) phenyl] methoxy)-2-phenylpiperidine], and L-733,061 [(2R,3R)-3-3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl) phenyl] methoxy)-2-phenylpiperidine]. Two hours later, gerbils received the NK1 agonist GR73632 [H2N( CH2)(4)-CO-Phe-Pro-NMe-Leu-Met- NH2] i.c. v. and foot tapping was measured for 5 min. The same procedure was used for ex vivo binding studies except that saline, rather than agonist, was administered i.c. v. before dissection of the striatum. The tissue homogenate was then used in an equilibrium radioligand binding assay. When IC50 values for inhibition of ex vivo I-125-substance P binding by NK1 antagonists were compared with the corresponding EC50 values for inhibition of GFT, a significant positive correlation was observed (r(2) = 0.97, p < 0.001). This result indicates that increased NK1 receptor occupancy in striatum by NK1 antagonists parallels the inhibition of agonist-mediated GFT. For all compounds, the dose that produced the maximum inhibition of GFT resulted in less than 100% ex vivo receptor occupancy in striatum. When gerbils did not receive the i.c. v. saline injection before ex vivo binding, thereby leaving the blood-brain barrier (BBB) intact, the IC50 values for antagonists were unchanged, suggesting that potential damage to the BBB caused by the i.c. v. injection did not affect determinations of antagonist potency in the GFT model.

To additionally exploit the high sensitivity and spatial resolution of fluorescence imaging for improved surgical guidance, a PSMA-I&T-based hybrid tracer, PSMA-I&F (DOTAGA-k(Sulfo-Cy5)-y-nal-k-Sub-KuE), has been developed and evaluated. Methods: The in vitro PSMA-targeting efficiency of PSMA-I&F, the reference PSMA-I&T, and their corresponding Ga-nat-/Ga-68- and Lu-nat/Lu-177 counterparts was determined in LNCaP cells via competitive binding assays (IC50) and dual-tracer radioligand and fluorescence internalization studies. Biodistribution and small-animal PET imaging studies were performed in CB17 SCID and LNCaP xenograft-bearing SHO mice, respectively, and complemented by intraoperative far-red fluorescence imaging using a clinical laparoscope. Additionally, fully automated serial cryosectioning and fluorescence imaging of 1 tumor-bearing animal as well as PSMA immunohistochemistry and fluorescence microscopy of organ cryosections (tumor, kidney, spleen) were also performed. Results: Compared with the parent PSMA-I&T analogs, the PSMA affinities of PSMA-I&F and its Ga-nat-/Lu-nat-complexes remained high and unaffected by dye conjugation (7.9 < IC50 < 10.5 nM for all ligands). The same was observed for the internalization of Ga-68- and Lu-177-PSMA-I&F. In vivo, blood clearance of Ga-68- and Lu-177-PSMA-I&F was only slightly delayed by high plasma protein binding (94%-95%), and very low accumulation in nontarget organs was observed already at 1 h after injection. Dynamic PET imaging confirmed PSMA-specific (as demonstrated by coinjection of 2-PMPA) uptake into the LNCaP xenograft (4.5% +/- 1.8 percentage injected dose per gram) and the kidneys (106% +/- 23 percentage injected dose per gram). Tumor-to-background ratios of 2.1, 5.2, 9.6, and 9.6 for blood, liver, intestines, and muscle, respectively, at 1 h after injection led to excellent imaging contrast in Ga-68-PSMA-I&F PET and in intraoperative fluorescence imaging. Furthermore, fluorescence imaging of tissue cryosections allowed high-resolution visualization of intraorgan PSMA-I&F distribution in vivo and its correlation with PSMA expression as determined by immunohistochemistry. Conclusion: Thus, with its high PSMA-targeting efficiency and favorable pharmacokinetic profile, Ga-68/Lu-177-PSMA-I&F serves as an excellent proof-of-concept compound for the general feasibility of PSMA-I&T-based hybrid imaging. The PSMA-I&T scaffold represents a versatile PSMA-targeted lead structure, allowing relatively straightforward adaptation to the different structural requirements of dedicated nuclear or hybrid imaging agents.

The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of F-18-FPYBF-2 as an amyloid imaging PET tracer in a first clinical study with healthy volunteers and patients with various dementia and in comparative dual tracer study using C-11-Pittsburgh Compound B (C-11-PiB). 61 healthy volunteers (age: 53.7 +/- 13.1 years old; 19 male and 42 female; age range 24-79) and 55 patients with suspected dementia [Alzheimer's Disease (AD); early AD: n = 19 and moderate stage AD: n = 8, other dementia: n = 9, mild cognitive impairment (MCI): n = 16, cognitively normal: n = 3] for first clinical study underwent static head PET/CT scan using (18) F (-) FPYBF-2 at 50-70 min after injection. 13 volunteers and 14 patients also underwent dynamic PET scan at 0-50 min at the same instant. 16 subjects (volunteers: n = 5, patients with dementia: n = 11) (age: 66.3 +/- 14.2 years old; 10 males and 6 females) were evaluated for comparative study (50-70 min after injection) using F-18-FPYBF-2 and C-11-PiB on separate days, respectively. Quantitative analysis of mean cortical uptake was calculated using Mean Cortical Index of SUVR (standardized uptake value ratio) based on the established method for C-11-PiB analysis using cerebellar cortex as control. Studies with healthy volunteers showed that F-18-FPYBF-2 uptake was mainly observed in cerebral white matter and that average Mean Cortical Index at 50-70 min was low and stable (1.066 +/- 0.069) basically independent from age or gender. In patients with AD, F-18-FPYBF-2 uptake was observed both in cerebral white and gray matter, and Mean Cortical Index was significantly higher (early AD: 1.288 +/- 0.134, moderate AD: 1.342 +/- 0.191) than those of volunteers and other dementia (1.018 +/- 0.057). In comparative study, the results of F-18-FPYBF-2 PET/CT were comparable with those of C-11-PiB, and the Mean Cortical Index (F-18-FPYBF-2: 1.173 +/- 0.215; C-11-PiB: 1.435 +/- 0.474) showed direct proportional relationship with each other (p < 0.0001). Our first clinical study suggest that F-18-FPYBF-2 is a useful PET tracer for the evaluation of beta-amyloid deposition and that quantitative analysis of Mean Cortical Index of SUVR is a reliable diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of AD.

J	Cook, RO; Shrewsbury, SB; Ramadan, NM				Cook, Robert O.; Shrewsbury, Stephen B.; Ramadan, Nabih M.			Reduced Adverse Event Profile of Orally Inhaled DHE (MAP0004) vs IV DHE: Potential Mechanism	HEADACHE			English	Article						dihydroergotamine mesylate; parenteral; migraine; pharmacokinetics; aerosol; pulmonary; oral inhalation; metabolites	DOUBLE-BLIND; DIHYDROERGOTAMINE; SAFETY; PHARMACOKINETICS; ERGOTAMINE; RECEPTORS; DRUG; PHARMACOLOGY; METABOLITE; MIGRAINE	Background.- MAP0004 is a novel orally inhaled formulation of dihydroergotamine mesylate (DHE) currently in development that has been clinically observed to provide rapid (similar to 10 minutes) therapeutic levels of DHE but with lower rates of adverse effects (dizziness, nausea, and paresthesia) compared with intravenous (IV) dosing. Receptor-based mechanistic studies were conducted to determine if differences between IV DHE and inhaled DHE (MAP0004) binding and functional activity were responsible for the improved adverse event profile. Methods.- Radioligand competitive binding assays were performed at adrenergic (alpha 1 [non-specific], alpha 2A, alpha 2B, alpha 2C, beta), dopaminergic (D; D-1, D-2, D-3), and at serotonergic (5-HT; 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3, 5-HT4, 5-HT5A, 5-HT6, 5-HT7) receptors. Binding assays were also conducted for the major metabolite of DHE, 8'-hydroxy-DHE (8'-OH-DHE). Subsequent functional receptor assays were also performed at 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3, D-2, alpha 1A, alpha 2A, alpha 2B, beta 1, and beta 2 and muscarinic receptors to ensure that observed receptor binding translated into potential functional response. Results.- For competitive binding studies, DHE demonstrated extensive activity at IV C-max for all 5-HT receptors tested, except 5-HT3 and 5-HT4, and alpha 1, alpha 2A, alpha 2B, alpha 2C, and D-3 receptors. DHE concentrations used in the studies were equal to the peak plasma concentrations (C-max) observed in human subjects following IV DHE 1.0 mg (the standard approved dose), and 2 and 4 inhalations MAP0004 which, respectively, produced systemic circulation levels of DHE equivalent to 0.44 mg and 0.88 mg administered IV. MAP0004 binding activity at the C-max concentrations was lower than IV DHE and no binding was observed for the 8'-OH-DHE metabolite. However, MAP0004 preserved potent agonist action at key anti-migraine 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors, even at the lower C-max concentrations. Functional binding studies displayed similar results whereby IV DHE C-max concentrations invoked strong agonist/antagonist responses, for instance at adrenergic and 5-HT2C receptors, which could have been responsible for dizziness. Conversely, at C-max concentrations of MAP0004, inhaled DHE achieved a significantly lower response or no response at the adrenergic and 5-HT2C receptors. Conclusions.- The mechanism by which nausea was experienced with IV DHE - yet not with MAP0004 - was not associated with classic nausea pathways/targets (dopamine, 5-HT3, or muscarinic receptors) or with peripheral action in the intestine via enterochromaffin cells. Importantly, the maximum DHE concentrations following MAP0004 administration were insufficient to interact with receptors implicated in cardiovascular (5-HT2B and beta(1)) and pulmonary effects (beta(2), adenosine, muscarinic, and leukotriene).

Because HUP-A has been shown to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, is more stable than the carbamates used as pretreatments for organophosphate poisoning (OP) and the HUP-A:AChE complex has a longer half-life than other prophylactic sequestering agents, HUP-A has been proposed as a pretreatment drug for nerve agent toxicity by protecting AChE from irreversible OP-induced phosphonylation. More recently (NeuroReport 8: 963-968), pretreatment of embryonic neuronal cultures with HUP-A reduced glutamate-induced cell death and also decreased glutamate-induced calcium mobilization. These results suggest that HUP-A might interfere with and be beneficial for excitatory amino acid overstimulation, such as seen in ischemia, where persistent elevation of internal calcium levels by activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate subtype receptor is found. We have now investigated the interaction of HUP-A with glutamate receptors. Freshly frozen cortex or synaptic plasma membranes were used, providing 60-90% specific radioligand binding. Huperzine A (:5100 muM) had no effect on the binding of [H-3]glutamate (low- and high-affinity glutamate sites), [H-3]MDL 105,519 (NMDA glycine regulatory site), [H-3]ifenprodil (NMDA polyamine site) or [H-3]CGS 19755 (NMDA antagonist). In contrast with these results, HUP-A noncompetitively (Hill slope < 1) inhibited [H-3]MK-801 and [H-3]TCP binding (co-located NMDA ion channel PCP site) with pseudo K-i similar to 6 muM. Furthermore, when neuronal cultures were pretreated with HUP-A for 45 ruin prior to NMDA exposure, HUP-A dose-dependently inhibited the NMDA-induced toxicity. Although HUP-A has been implicated to interact with cholinergic receptors, it was without effect at 100 muM on musearinic (measured by inhibition of [H-3]QNB or [H-3]NMS binding) or nicotinic [H-3]epibatidine binding) receptors; also, HUP-A did not perturb adenosine receptor binding [H-3]PIA or [H-3]NECA). Therefore, HUPA most likely attenuates excitatory amino acid toxicity by blocking the NMDA ion channel and subsequent Ca2+ mobilization at or near the PCP and MK-801 ligand sites. Thus, on the one hand, HUP-A could be used as a pretreatment against OPs and it might also be a valuable therapeutic intervention in a variety of acute and chronic disorders by protecting against overstimulation of the excitatory amino acid pathway. By blocking NMDA ion channels without psychotomimetic side-effects, HUP-A may protect against diverse neurodegenerative states observed during ischemia or Alzheimer's disease.

The results were validated with respect to the prognostication of overall survival in patients with advanced-stage prostate cancer.Materials and methodsA total of 78 patients who underwent [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 radionuclide therapy from January 2018 to December 2020 were retrospectively included in this study. [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 PET images, acquired prior to radionuclide therapy, were used for the analysis of thresholding algorithms. All PET images were first analyzed semi-automatically using a pre-evaluated, proprietary software solution as the baseline method. Subsequently, five histogram-based thresholding methods and two local adaptive thresholding methods that are well established in computer vision were applied to quantify molecular tumor volume. The resulting whole-body molecular tumor volumes were validated with respect to the prognostication of overall patient survival as well as their statistical correlation to the baseline methods and their performance on standardized phantom scans.ResultsThe whole-body PSMA-TVs, quantified using different thresholding methods, demonstrate a high positive correlation with the baseline methods. We observed the highest correlation with generalized histogram thresholding (GHT) (Pearson r (r), p value (p): r = 0.977, p < 0.001) and Sauvola thresholding (r = 0.974, p < 0.001) and the lowest correlation with Multiotsu (r = 0.877, p < 0.001) and Yen thresholding methods (r = 0.878, p < 0.001). The median survival time of all patients was 9.87 months (95% CI [9.3 to 10.13]). Stratification by median whole-body PSMA-TV resulted in a median survival time from 11.8 to 13.5 months for the patient group with lower tumor burden and 6.5 to 6.6 months for the patient group with higher tumor burden. The patient group with lower tumor burden had significantly higher probability of survival (p < 0.00625) in eight out of nine thresholding methods (Fig. 2); those methods were SUVmax50 (p = 0.0038), SUV >= 3 (p = 0.0034), Multiotsu (p = 0.0015), Yen (p = 0.0015), Niblack (p = 0.001), Sauvola (p = 0.0001), Otsu (p = 0.0053), and Li thresholding (p = 0.0053).ConclusionThresholding methods commonly used in computer vision are promising tools for the semiautomatic quantification of whole-body PSMA-TV in [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11-PET. The proposed algorithm-driven thresholding strategy is less arbitrary and less prone to biases than thresholding with predefined values, potentially improving the application of whole-body PSMA-TV as an imaging biomarker.

However, the high uptake of Ga-68-PSMA-11 in kidneys can create halo-artifacts resulting in lower detection sensitivity for lesions adjacent to the kidneys. In this study, we developed two Ga-68-labeled PSMA-targeted tracers, Ga-68-HTK01166 and Ga-68-HTK01167, based on Ga-68-PSMA-617 with the goal of improving tumor-to-kidney ratio compared to Ga-68-PSMA11. The 2-naphthylalanine (2-Nal) in PSMA-617 was replaced with 2-indanylglycine (Igl) or 3,3-diphenylalanine (Dip) to synthesize HTK01166 and HTK01167, respectively. Binding affinities (K-i) of Ga-PSMA-11, Ga-PSMA-617, Ga-HTK01166, and Ga-HTK01167 to PSMA were 3.13 +/- 0.40, 1.23 +/- 0.08, 5.74 +/- 2.48, and 25.7 +/- 9.84 nM, respectively, as determined by in vitro competition binding assays. Ga-68 labeling was performed in HEPES buffer with microwave heating, and Ga-68-labeled PSMA-11, PSMA-617, HTK01166, and HTK01167 were obtained in 46-69% average decay-corrected radiochemical yield with >99% radiochemical purity and 62.9-152 GBq/ptmol average specific activity. PET imaging and biodistribution studies were performed in mice bearing PSMA-expressing LNCap prostate cancer xenografts. All tracers enabled clear visualization of tumors in PET images with excellent tumor-to-background contrast. The uptake values (%ID/g) for tumor and kidneys at 1 h postinjection were 8.91 +/- 0.86 and 204 +/- 70.6 for Ga-68-PSMA-11, 16.7 +/- 2.30 and 29.2 +/- 5.14 for Ga-68-PSMA-617, 14.1 4.40 and 147 +/- 59.6 for Ga-68-HTK01166, and 7.79 +/- 1.65 and 4.30 +/- 1.80 for Ga-68-HTK01167. The tumor-to-kidney ratios for 68Ga-labeled PSMA-11, PSMA-617, HTK01166, and HTK01167 were 0.05 +/- 0.02, 0.63 +/- 0.10, 0.10 +/- 0.02, and 1.98 +/- 0.63, respectively. Compared with Ga-68-PSMA-617, Ga-68-HTK01166 showed comparable tumor uptake and almost 5-fold higher kidney uptake, whereas Ga-68-HTK01167 exhibited lower tumor and kidney uptake. Compared with Ga-68-PSMA-11, Ga-68-HTK01167 had similar tumor uptake and tumor-to-blood contrast ratio (23.8 +/- 6.71 vs 20.4 +/- 4.98) but higher tumor-to background contrast ratios for other background organs especially for kidneys. Our data indicate that substitution of 2-Nal in PSMA-617 with other lipophilic amino acid can modulate PSMA binding affinity and their pharmacokinetics in vivo.

Measuring response in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer using PSMA PET/CT: comparison of RECIST 1.1, aPCWG3, aPERCIST, PPP, and RECIP 1.0 criteria	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						Response evaluation; Radionuclide treatment; PSMA PET; Lu-177-PSMA; Theranostics	TRACER	Purpose To compare the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, the adapted Prostate Cancer Working Group Criteria 3 (aPCWG3), the adapted Positron Emission Tomography Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (aPERCIST), the PSMA PET Progression (PPP), and the Response Evaluation Criteria In PSMA-Imaging (RECIP) 1.0 for response evaluation using prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-PET/CT in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) treated with Lu-177-PSMA radioligand therapy. Methods A total of 124 patients were included in this multicenter retrospective study. All patients received Lu-177-PSMA and underwent PSMA-PET/CT scans at baseline (bPET) and at 12 weeks (iPET). Imaging responses according to RECIST 1.1, aPCWG3, aPERCIST, PPP, and RECIP 1.0 were interpreted by consensus among three blinded readers. Changes in total tumor burden were obtained using the semi-automatic qPSMA software. The response according to each criterion was classified to progressive disease (PD) vs no-PD. Primary outcome measure was the prognostic value (by Cox regression analysis) for overall survival (OS). Secondary outcome measure was the inter-reader reliability (by Cohen's kappa coefficient). Results A total of 43 (35%) of patients had non-measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1. Sixteen (13%), 66 (52%), 72 (58%), 69 (56%), and 39 (32%) of 124 patients had PD according to RECIST 1.1, aPCWG3, aPERCIST, PPP, and RECIP, respectively. PD vs no-PD had significantly higher risk of death according to aPCWG3 (HR = 2.37; 95%CI, 1.62-3.48; p < 0.001), aPERCIST (HR= 2.48; 95%CI, 1.68-3.66; p < 0.001), PPP (HR = 2.72; 95%CI, 1.85-4.01; p < 0.001), RECIP 1.0 (HR = 4.33; 95%CI, 2.80-6.70; p < 0.001), but not according to RECIST 1.1 (HR= 1.29; 95%CI, 0.73-2.27; p = 0.38). The K. index of RECIST 1.1, aPCWG3, aPERCIST 1.0, PPP, and RECIP 1.0 for identifying PD vs no-PD were 0.50 (95%CI, 0.32-0.76), 0.72 (95%CI, 0.63-0.82), 0.68 (95%CI, 0.63-0.73), 0.73 (95%CI, 0.63-0.83), and 0.83 (95%CI, 0.77-0.88), respectively. Conclusion PSMA-PET-specific criteria for early response evaluation in men with mCRPC treated with Lu-177-PSMA achieved higher prognostic values and inter-reader reliabilities in comparison to conventional CT assessment or to criteria adapted to PSMA-PET from other imaging modalities. RECIP 1.0 identified the fewest patients with PD and achieved the highest risk of death for PD vs. no-PD, suggesting that other classification methods tend to overcall progression. Prospective validation of our findings on an independent patient cohort is warranted.

Methods: RESIST-PC(NCT03042312) was a prospective multicenter phase 2 trial. Patients with progressive mCRPC after >= 1 novel androgen-axis drug, either chemotherapy naive or postchemotherapy, with sufficient bone marrow reserve, normal kidney function, and sufficient PSMA expression by PSMA PET were eligible. Patients were randomized (1:1) into 2 activity groups (6.0 or 7.4 GBq) and received up to 4 cycles every 8 wk. The primary endpoint was the efficacy of Lu-177-PSMA measured by the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate (RR) after 2 cycles (>= 50% decline from baseline). Secondary endpoints included the PSA RR (>= 50% decline) at any time (best response), and overall survival (OS). Results: The study was closed at enrollment of 71/200 planned patients because of sponsorship transfer. We report here the efficacy of the University of California Los Angeles cohort results only (n=43). The PSA RRs after 2 cycles and at any time were 11/40 (28%, 95% CI 15-44), 6/13 (46%, 95% CI 19-75), and 5/27 (19%, 95% CI 6-38), and 16/43 (37%, 95% CI 23-53), 7/14 (50%, 95% CI 23-77), and 9/29 (31%, 95% CI 15-51) in the whole cohort, the 6.0-GBq group, and the 7.4-GBq group, respectively (P=0.12 and P=0.31). The median OS was 14.0 mo (95% CI 10.1-17.9), 15.8 (95% CI 11.8-19.4), and 13.5 (95% CI 10.0-17.0) in the whole cohort, the 6.0-GBq group, and the 7.4 GBq group, respectively (P=0.87). OS was longer in patients who experienced a PSA decline >= 50% at any time than in those who did not: median, 20.8 versus 10.8mo (P=0.005). Conclusion: In this prospective phase 2 trial of Lu-177-PSMA for mCRPC, the median OS was 14 mo. Despite the heterogeneous study population and the premature study termination, the efficacy profile of Lu-177-PSMA appeared to be favorable and comparable with both activity regimens (6.0 vs. 7.4 GBq). Results justify confirmation with real-world data matched-pair analysis and further clinical trials to refine and optimize the Lu-177-PSMA therapy administration scheme to improve tumor radiation dose delivery and efficacy.

Development of programmable gemcitabine-GnRH pro-drugs bearing linker controllable "click" oxime bond tethers and preclinical evaluation against prostate cancer	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Gemcitabine; Peptide-drug conjugate; Pharmacokinetics; Stability; Oxime ligation	PEPTIDE; LIGATION; CHEMORESISTANCE; METABOLISM; CONJUGATE; CATALYSIS; CELLS; ANGIOGENESIS; EXPRESSION; HYDRAZONES	Peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs) are gaining considerable attention as anti-neoplastic agents. However, their development is often laborious and time-consuming. Herein, we have developed and preclinically evaluated three PDCs with gemcitabine as the anticancer cytotoxic unit and D-Lys6-GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone; GnRH) as the cancer-targeting unit. These units were tethered via acid-labile programmable linkers to guide a differential drug release rate from the PDC through a combination of ester or amide and "click" type oxime ligations. The pro-drugs were designed to enable the selective targeting of malignant tumor cells with linker guided differential drug release rates. We exploited the oxime bond responsiveness against the acidic pH of the tumor microenvironment and the GnRH endocytosis via the GnRH-R GPCR which is overexpressed on cancer cells. The challenging metabolic properties of gemcitabine were addressed during design of the PDCs. We developed a rapid (1 hour) and cost-effective "click" oxime bond ligation platform to assemble in one-pot the 3 desired PDCs that does not require purification, surpassing traditional time-ineffective and low yield methods. The internalization of the tumor-homing peptide unit in cancer cells, overexpressing the GnRH-R, was first validated through confocal laser microscopy and flow cytometry analysis. Subsequently, the three PDCs were evaluated for their in vitro antiproliferative effect in prostate cancer cells. Their stability and the release of gemcitabine over time were monitored in vitro in cell culture and in human plasma using LC-MS/MS. We then assessed the ability of the developed PDCs to internalize in prostate cancer cells and to release gemcitabine. The most potent analog, designated GOXG(1), was used for pharmacokinetic studies in mice. The metabolism of GOXG(1) was examined in liver microsomes, as well as in buffers mimicking the pH of intracellular organelles, resulting in the identification of two metabolites. The major metabolite at low pH emanated from the cleavage of the pH-labile oxime bond, validating our design approach. NMR spectroscopy and in vitro radioligand binding assays were exploited for GOXG(1) to validate that upon conjugating the drug to the peptide, the peptide microenvironment responsible for its GnRH-R binding is not perturbed and to confirm its high binding potency to the GnRH-R. Finally, the binding of GOXG(1) to the GnRH-R and the associated elicitation of testosterone release in mice were also determined. The facile platform established herein for the rapid assembly of PDCs with linker controllable characteristics from aldehyde and aminooxy units through rapid "click" oxime ligation, that does not require purification steps, could pave the way for a new generation of potent cancer therapeutics, diagnostics and theranostics.

PUCs that inhibited [H-3]EBOB binding include pyrazoles: 1H-1,2,3-triazoles; a 1H-1,2,4-triazole; 1,3,4-oxadiazol-2(3H)-ones; a 1,3,4-oxadiazole-2(3H)-thione; 1,2,4-oxadiazoles; a 1,2,4-thiadiazole; thiazoles; a 4(3H)-pyrimidinone: and a 2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione. An analogue (1) of the pyrazole insecticide fipronil, bearing an SCF3 group in place of the S(O)CF3, was found to be the most potent inhibitor wit IC(50)s of 7.55 and 177 nM in housefly head and mt brain membranes, respectively. 3-(2,6-Dichloro-3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-5-t-butyl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2(3H)-one exhibited the highest selectivity fur housefly GABA receptors versus rat receptors (IC50 rat/IC50 fly >204). PHCs that exhibited a comparable selectivity include a pyrazole and a 1H-1,2,3-triazole interaction of 16 selected PHCs with rat brain GABA-gated channels was also examined using [S-35]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS), a radioligand for the mammalian noncompetitive antagonist site. A plot of pTC(50)s of 12 PHCs revealed a close correlation (r = 0.93) between their potency in inhibiting [H-3]EBOB and [S-35]TBPS binding. Scatchard analyses of the inhibition of [S-35]TBPS binding by 1 suggested a compeiiti\e-typr inhibition. A plot of the potency of IJ PHCs in inhibiting [H-3]EBOB binding to housefly head membranes against their piperonyl butoxide-synergized insecticidal effect on German cockroaches yielded a close correlation (r = 0.89), with the exception of five triazoles and a 2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione. Although several selected PHCs also inhibited the specific binding of [H-3]batrachotoxinin A 20-alpha-benzoate, a tritiated analogue of the sodium channel activator batrachotoxinin, to synaptosomes and membranes prepared from mouse brains, housefly heads, and American cockroach nerve cords, the concentrations required were higher than those of standard compounds producing significant effects on this system. The results demonstrate that a variety of five- and six-membered, nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds, bearing a 2,6-dichloro-4-trifluoromethyphenyl or 2,4,6-trichlorophenyl group, interact with ionotropic GABA receptors. Several PHCs display higher affinities for housefly GABA receptors and high selectivity as compared to rat GABA receptors. PHCs' insecticidal activity is mediated by their interaction with GABA-gated chloride channels. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

J	Yamada, S; Okura, T; Kimura, R				Yamada, S; Okura, T; Kimura, R			In vivo demonstration of α<sub>1A</sub>-adrenoceptor subtype selectivity of KMD-3213 in rat tissues	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERPLASIA; ALPHA(1)-ADRENOCEPTOR ANTAGONIST; ALPHA-1-ADRENOCEPTOR; TAMSULOSIN; CLASSIFICATION; HETEROGENEITY; CONTRACTIONS; HYPERTROPHY; AFFINITIES; RECEPTORS	The present study was undertaken to characterize the in vivo alpha (1)-adrenoceptor binding of KMD-3213, a novel selective antagonist of alpha (1A)-adrenoceptors, in rat tissues by using a tritiated ligand with high specific activity, in comparison with that of [H-3]prazosin. A significant degree of in vivo specific binding of [H-3]KMD-3213 after i.v. injection of the radioligand (1.4 nmol/kg) was seen in most rat tissues, except the cerebral cortex, spleen, and liver, which showed a little or no specific binding. There was a notable difference among tissues in the time course of specific [H-3]KMD-3213 binding after i.v. injection of the ligand. The specific binding in the lung, kidney, and spleen was greatest at 10 min and declined rapidly with the disappearance of the ligand from the plasma. On the other hand, [H-3]KMD-3213 binding in the submaxillary gland, deferens, and prostate attained peak levels at 60 min, and a considerable degree of binding was present even at 240 min. After i. v. injection of a similar dose (1.2 nmol/kg) of [H-3]prazosin in rats, the in vivo specific binding in the submaxillary gland was greatest at 10 min and then it fell rapidly, whereas [H-3]prazosin binding in the spleen attained a peak level at 60 min, and this was maintained even at 120 min. The AUC(0-120) values of the specific binding for [H-3]KMD-3213, compared with those of [ H-3] prazosin, were markedly lower in the rat aorta, spleen, and liver, whereas the prostate, submaxillary gland, and lung showed significantly higher AUC(0-120) values of [H-3]KMD-3213 compared with [H-3]prazosin. Furthermore, the in vivo specific binding of [H-3]KMD-3213 at dose ranges of 1.4 to 13.6 nmol/kg increased linearly in the prostate and submaxillary gland, but did not increase in a dose-dependent manner in the spleen. On the other hand, there was a dose-dependent increase in the in vivo specific binding of [H-3]prazosin at doses of 1.2 to 10.6 nmol/kg in all tissues. The in vivo specific binding of [H-3]KMD-3213 in rat tissues was reduced by concomitant i.v. injection of low doses of prazosin in a dose-dependent manner, but not by even a relatively high dose of yohimbine. In conclusion, the present study shows that KMD-3213 binds to the alpha (1A)-adrenoceptor subtype with a higher affinity than to the alpha (1B)- and alpha (1D)-subtypes under in vivo condition, thus leading to prostate selectivity.

High SUVs Have More Robust Repeatability in Patients with Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Results from a Prospective Test-Retest Cohort Imaged with <SUP>18</SUP>F-DCFPyL	MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article							RADIATION-DOSIMETRY; MEMBRANE ANTIGEN; PET/CT; PSMA; BIODISTRIBUTION	Objectives. In patients with prostate cancer (PC) receiving prostate-specific membrane antigen- (PSMA-) targeted radioligand therapy (RLT), higher baseline standardized uptake values (SUVs) are linked to improved outcome. Thus, readers deciding on RLT must have certainty on the repeatability of PSMA uptake metrics. As such, we aimed to evaluate the test-retest repeatability of lesion uptake in a large cohort of patients imaged with F-18-DCFPyL. Methods. In this prospective, IRB-approved trial (NCT03793543), 21 patients with history of histologically proven PC underwent two F-18-DCFPyL PET/CTs within 7 days (mean 3.7, range 1 to 7 days). Lesions in the bone, lymph nodes (LN), and other organs were manually segmented on both scans, and uptake parameters were assessed (maximum (SUVmax) and mean (SUVmean) SUVs), PSMA-tumor volume (PSMA-TV), and total lesion PSMA (TL-PSMA, defined as PSMA-TVxSUV(mean))). Repeatability was determined using Pearson's correlations, within-subject coefficient of variation (wCOV), and Bland-Altman analysis. Results. In total, 230 pairs of lesions (177 bone, 38 LN, and 15 other) were delineated, demonstrating a wide range of SUVmax (1.5-80.5) and SUVmean (1.4-24.8). Including all sites of suspected disease, SUVs had a strong interscan correlation (R-2 >= 0.99), with high repeatability for SUVmean and SUVmax (wCOV, 7.3% and 12.1%, respectively). High SUVs showed significantly improved wCOV relative to lower SUVs (P<0.0001), indicating that high SUVs are more repeatable, relative to the magnitude of the underlying SUV. Repeatability for PSMA-TV and TL-PSMA, however, was low (wCOV >= 23.5%). Across all metrics for LN and bone lesions, interscan correlation was again strong (R-2 >= 0.98). Moreover, LN-based SUVmean also achieved the best wCOV (3.8%), which was significantly reduced when compared to osseous lesions (7.8%, P<0.0001). This was also noted for SUVmax (wCOV, LN 8.8% vs. bone 12.0%, P<0.03). On a compartment-based level, wCOVs for volumetric features were >= 22.8%, demonstrating no significant differences between LN and bone lesions (PSMA-TV, P=0.63; TL-PSMA, P=0.9). Findings on an entire tumor burden level were also corroborated in a hottest lesion analysis investigating the SUVmax of the most intense lesion per patient (R-2, 0.99; wCOV, 11.2%). Conclusion. In this prospective test-retest setting, SUV parameters demonstrated high repeatability, in particular in LNs, while volumetric parameters demonstrated low repeatability. Further, the large number of lesions and wide distribution of SUVs included in this analysis allowed for the demonstration of a dependence of repeatability on SUV, with higher SUVs having more robust repeatability.

PET imaging of chronic traumatic encephalopathy may provide a means to move towards ante-mortem diagnosis and therapeutic intervention following brain injuries. Characterization of the neuroinflammatory PET biomarkers, 18 kDa translocator protein and monoamine oxidase-B was conducted using [H-3]PBR-28 and [H-3]L-deprenyl, respectively, in post-mortem chronic traumatic encephalopathy brain tissue. [H-3]PBR-28 displayed high specific binding in both chronic traumatic encephalopathy (95.40 +/- 1.87%; n = 11 cases) and healthy controls (89.89 +/- 8.52%, n = 3 cases). Cell-type expression of the 18 kDa translocator protein was confirmed by immunofluorescence to microglia, astrocyte and macrophage markers. [H-3]L-deprenyl also displayed high specific binding in chronic traumatic encephalopathy (96.95 +/- 1.43%; n = 12 cases) and healthy controls (93.24 +/- 0.43%; n = 2 cases), with the distribution co-localized to astrocytes by immunofluorescence. Saturation analysis was performed to quantify the target density of the 18 kDa translocator protein and monoamine oxidase-B in both chronic traumatic encephalopathy and healthy control tissue. Using [H-3]PBR-28, the target density of the 18 kDa translocator protein in healthy controls was 177.91 +/- 56.96 nM (n = 7 cases; mean +/- standard deviation); however, a highly variable target density (345.84 +/- 372.42 nM; n = 11 cases; mean +/- standard deviation) was measured in chronic traumatic encephalopathy. [H-3]L-deprenyl quantified a monoamine oxidase-B target density of 304.23 +/- 115.93 nM (n = 8 cases; mean +/- standard deviation) in healthy control tissue and is similar to the target density in chronic traumatic encephalopathy tissues (365.80 +/- 128.55 nM; n = 12 cases; mean +/- standard deviation). A two-sample t-test determined no significant difference in the target density values of the 18 kDa translocator protein and monoamine oxidase-B between healthy controls and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (P > 0.05), albeit a trend towards increased expression of both targets was observed in chronic traumatic encephalopathy. To our knowledge, this work represents the first in vitro characterization of 18 kDa translocator protein and monoamine oxidase-B in chronic traumatic encephalopathy and reveals the variability in neuroinflammatory pathology following brain injuries. These preliminary findings will be considered when designing PET imaging studies after brain injury and for the ultimate goal of imaging chronic traumatic encephalopathy in vivo. Varlow et al. report the first in vitro evaluation of PET imaging biomarkers for neuroinflammation in chronic traumatic encephalopathy. High variability in neuroinflammatory pathology target density was found in chronic traumatic encephalopathy compared with healthy controls. In vivo imaging of neuroinflammatory biomarkers in brain injuries is warranted.

However, PSA measurements are considered only after 12 wk of treatment. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of early PSA changes after Lu-177-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen (Lu-177-PSMA) radionuclide treatment in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients. Methods: Men who were treated with Lu-177-PSMA under a compassionate-access program at our institution and had available PSA values at baseline and at 6 wk after treatment initiation were included in this retrospective analysis. Patients were assigned to 3 groups on the basis of PSA changes: response (>= 30% decline), progression (>= 25% increase), and stable (,30% decline and,25% increase). The coprimary endpoints were overall survival and imaging-based progression-free survival. The secondary endpoints were PSA changes at 12 wk and PSA flare-up. Results: We identified 124 eligible patients with PSA values at 6 wk. A greater than or equal to 30% decline in PSA at 6 wk was associated with longer overall survival (median, 16.7 mo; 95% CI, 14.4-19.0) than stable PSA (median, 11.8 mo; 95% CI, 8.6-15.1) (P = 0.007) or PSA progression (median, 6.5 mo; 95% CI, 5.2-7.8) (P < 0.001). Patients with a greater than or equal to 30% decline in PSA at 6 wk also had a lower risk of imaging-based progression than patients with stable PSA (hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.38-0.94) (P = 0.02), whereas patients with PSA progression had a higher risk of imagingbased progression than patients with stable PSA (hazard ratio, 3.18; 95% CI, 1.95-5.21) (P < 0.001). The percentage changes in PSA at 6 and 12 wk were highly associated (r = 0.90; P < 0.001). Of 31 patients who experienced early PSA progression at 6 wk, 29 (94%) showed biochemical progression at 12 wk. Overall, only 1 (3%) of 36 patients with PSA progression at 6 wk achieved any PSA decline at 12 wk (1% of the entire cohort). The limitations of the study included its retrospective nature and the single-center experience. Conclusion: PSA changes at 6 wk after Lu-177-PSMA initiation are an early indicator of long-term clinical outcome. Patients with PSA progression after 6 wk of treatment could benefit from a very early decision to switch treatment. PSA flare-up during Lu-177-PSMA treatment is very uncommon. Prospective studies are now warranted to validate our findings and potentially inform clinicians earlier on the effectiveness of Lu-177-PSMA.

Evaluation of the Lysophosphatidic Acid Receptor Type 1 Radioligand <SUP>11</SUP>C-BMT-136088 for Lung Imaging in Rhesus Monkeys	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						lysophosphatidic acid receptor type 1; lung; positron emission tomography; preclinical imaging; idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis	PULMONARY BLOOD-FLOW; POSITRON-EMISSION; NOMENCLATURE; FIBROSIS; PROTEIN; IMAGES	The lysophosphatidic acid receptor type 1 (LPA1) is 1 of 6 known receptors of the extracellular signaling molecule lysophosphatidic acid. It mediates effects such as cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. In the lung, LPA1 is involved in pathways leading, after lung tissue injury, to pulmonary fibrosis instead of normal healing, by mediating fibroblast recruitment and vascular leakage. Thus, a LPA1 PET radiotracer may be useful for studying lung fibrosis or for developing LPA1-targeting drugs. We developed and evaluated the radiotracer C-11-BMT-136088 (1-(4'-(3-methyl-4-(((1(R)-(3-C-11-methylphenyl)ethoxy)carbonyl)amino)isoxazol-5-yl)-[1,19-biphenyl]4-yl)cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid) in rhesus monkeys to image LPA1 in the lung in vivo with PET. Methods: The study consisted of 3 parts: test-retest scans; self-saturation to estimate the tracer's in vivo dissociation constant, nondisplaceable volume of distribution (V-ND), and nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND); and dosimetry. In the first 2 parts, the radiotracer was administered using a bolus-plus-infusion protocol, the arterial input function was measured, and the animals underwent 2 scans per day separated by about 4 h. Lung regions of interest were segmented, and the tissue density estimated, from CT images. A fixed blood volume correction was applied. The tracer volume of distribution (V-T) was estimated using multilinear analysis 1 (MA1) or equilibrium analysis (EA). Results: C-11-BMT-136088 baseline V-T was 1.83 +/- 0.16 (MA1, n = 5) or 2.1 +/- 0.55 (EA, n = 7) mL of plasma per gram of tissue in the left and right lung regions of interest, with a test-retest variability of 26% (MA1, n = 1) or -1% +/- 14% (EA, n = 2). For the self-saturation study, C-11-BMT-136088 V-ND and BPND were estimated to be 0.9 +/- 0.08 mL of plasma per gram of tissue and 1.1 +/- 0.14, respectively. The unlabeled drug dose and plasma concentration leading to a 50% reduction of C-11-BMT-136088 specific binding were 73 +/- 30 nmol/kg and 28 +/- 12 nM, respectively. The average plasma free fraction was 0.2%; thus, the tracer's in vivo dissociation constant was estimated to be 55 pM. For the dosimetry study, the highest organ dose was in the liver (43.1 +/- 4.9 and 68.9 +/- 9.4 mu Sv/MBq in reference human male and female phantoms, respectively), and the effective dose equivalent was 6.9 +/- 0.6 and 8.7 +/- 0.6 mu Sv/MBq, respectively. Conclusion: Specific binding of C-11-BMT-136088 can be reliably measured to quantify LPA1 in the lungs of rhesus monkeys in vivo.

Cyclisation may protect the peptide from metabolic degradation. In competition binding studies of rat, mouse and human NOP the following rank order pK(i) was obtained: N/OFQ(1-13)NH2(reference agonist)>N/OFQ=c[Cys(10,14)]>>c[Nphe(1)Cys(10,14)]. In GTPgamma(35)S studies of Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing human NOP (CHOhNOP) c[Cys(10,14)] (pEC(50) 8.29) and N/OFQ(1-13)NH2 (pEC(50) 8.57) were full agonists whilst c[Nphe(1)Cys(10,14)] alone was inactive. Following 30 min pre-incubation c[Nphe(1)Cys(10,14)] competitively antagonised the effects of N/OFQ(1-13)NH2 with a pA(2) and slope factor of 6.92 and 1.01 respectively. In cAMP assays c[Cys(10,14)] (pEC(50) 9.29, E-max 102% inhibition of the forskolin stimulated response), N/OFQ(1-13)NH2 (pEC(50) 10.16, E-max 103% inhibition) and c[Nphe(1)Cys(10,14)] (similar to80% inhibition at 10 muM) displayed agonist activity. In the mouse vas deferens c[Cys(10,14)] (pEC(50) 6.82, E-max 89% inhibition of electrically evoked contractions) and N/OFQ(1-13)NH2 (pEC(50) 7.47, E-max 93% inhibition) were full agonists whilst c[Nphe(1)Cys(10,14)] alone was inactive. c[Nphe(1)Cys(10,14)] (10 muM) competitively antagonised the effects of N/OFQ(1-13)NH2 with a pK(B) of 5.66. In a crude attempt to assess metabolic stability, c[Cys(10,14)] was incubated with rat brain membranes and then the supernatant assayed for remaining peptide. Following 60 min incubation 64% of the 1 nM added peptide was metabolised (compared with 54% for N/OFQ-NH2). In summary, we report that c[Cys(10,14)] is a full agonist with a small reduction in potency but no improvement in stability whilst c[Nphe(1)Cys(10,14)] displays tissue (antagonist in the vas deferens) and assay (antagonist in the GTPgamma(35)S assay and agonist in cAMP assay) dependent activity.

Selective allosteric modulators of mGlu subtype 5 (mGlu(5)) have the potential to alleviate symptoms of numerous central nervous system disorders such as schizophrenia in a more targeted fashion. Multiple mGlu(5) positive allosteric modulators (PAMs), such as 1-(3-fluorophenyl)-N-((3-fluorophenyl)-methylideneamino)methanimine (DFB), 3-cyano-N-(1,3-diphenyl-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)-benzamide (CDPPB), and 4-nitro-N-(1,3-diphenyl-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)-benzamide (VU-29), exert their actions by binding to a defined allosteric site on mGlu(5) located in the seven-transmembrane domain (7TM) and shared by mGlu(5) negative allosteric modulator (NAM) 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP). Actions of the PAM N-{4-chloro-2-[(1,3-dioxo-1,3-dihydro-2H-isoindol-2-yl)methyl]phenyl}-2-hydroxybenzamide (CPPHA) are mediated by a distinct allosteric site in the 7TM domain different from the MPEP binding site. Experimental evidence confirms these findings through mutagenesis experiments involving residues F585 (TM1) and A809 (TM7). In an effort to investigate mGlu(5) PAM selectivity for this alternative allosteric site distinct from MPEP binding, we employed in silico quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling. Subsequent ligand-based virtual screening prioritized a set of 63 candidate compounds predicted from a library of over 4 million commercially available compounds to bind exclusively to this novel site. Experimental validation verified the biological activity for seven of 63 selected candidates. Further, medicinal chemistry optimizations based on these molecules revealed compound VU6003586 with an experimentally validated potency of 174 nM. Radioligand binding experiments showed only partial inhibition at very high concentrations, most likely indicative of binding at a non-MPEP site. Selective positive allosteric modulators for mGlu(5) have the potential for tremendous impact concerning devastating neurological disorders such as schizophrenia and Huntington's disease. These identified and validated novel selective compounds can serve as starting points for more specifically tailored lead and probe molecules and thus help the development of potential therapeutic agents with reduced adverse effects.

The S1R is involved in the regulation of many neurotransmission systems and, indirectly, in neurodegenerative diseases. The S1R may therefore represent an interesting neuronal biomarker in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's (PD) or Alzheimer's diseases (AD). Here we present the characterisation of the S1R-specific F-18-labelled tracer F-18-IAM6067 in two animal models and in human brain tissue. Methods: Wistar rats were used for PET-CT imaging (60 min dynamic acquisition) and metabolite analysis (1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 60 min post-injection). To verify in vivo selectivity, haloperidol, BD1047 (S1R ligand), CM398 (S2R ligand) and SB206553 (5HT 2B/C antagonist) were administrated for pre-saturation studies. Excitotoxic lesions induced by intra-striatal injection of AMPA were also imaged by F-18-IAM6067 PET-CT to test the sensitivity of the methods in a well-established model of neuronal loss. Tracer brain uptake was also verified by autoradiography in rats and in a mouse model of PD (intrastriatal 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) unilateral lesion). Finally, human cortical binding was investigated by autoradiography in three groups of subjects (control subjects with Braak >2, and AD patients, Braak <= 4 and Braak >4 stages). Results: We demonstrate that despite rapid peripheral metabolism of 18 F-IAM6067, radiolabelled metabolites were hardly detected in brain samples. Brain uptake of F-18-IAM6067 showed differences in S1R anatomical distribution, namely from high to low uptake: pons-raphe, thalamus medio-dorsal, substantia nigra , hypothalamus, cerebellum, cortical areas and striatum. Pre-saturation studies showed 79-90% blockade of the binding in all areas of the brain indicated above except with the 5HT 2B/C antagonist SB206553 and S2R ligand CM398 which induced no significant blockade, indicating good specificity of F-18-IAM6067 for S1Rs. No difference between ipsi-and contralateral sides of the brain in the mouse model of PD was detected. AMPA lesion induced a significant 69% decrease in F-18-IAM6067 uptake in the globus pallidus matching the neuronal loss as measured by NeuN, but only a trend to decrease (-16%) in the caudate putamen despite a significant 91% decrease in neuronal count. Moreover, no difference in the human cortical binding was shown between AD groups and controls. Conclusion: This work shows that F-18-IAM6067 is a specific and selective S1R radiotracer. The absence or small changes in S1R detected here in animal models and human tissue warrants further investigations and suggests that S1R might not be the anticipated ideal biomarker for neuronal loss in neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and PD.

At present, no imaging techniques are capable of measuring acute fluctuations in endogenous glutamate levels in vivo. We evaluated the potential of C-11-ABP688, a PET ligand that binds to an allosteric site of the metabotropic glutamate 5 receptor, in rats by using small-animal PET and b-microprobes after pharmacologic challenges with N-acetylcysteine (NAc) and MK-801. Both compounds are known to induce increases in endogenous glutamate levels. Methods: Three experiments with C-11-ABP688 were performed to validate our study setup: first, metabolite analyses during workup (n = 3) and after a selected treatment (n 5 3); second, a test-retest (n = 12) small-animal PET experiment (1 h scan; 27.75 MBq of (11)CABP688 administered intravenously;,3 nmol/kg); and third, a small-animal PET and b-microprobe cold blocking study (n = 6/condition) with unlabeled ABP688. After this experimental validation, rats were pretreated with either NAc (intravenous infusion of 50 mg/kg/h) or MK-801 (0.16 mg/kg; given intraperitoneally); this step was followed by small-animal PET with C-11-ABP688 (n = 12) or b-microprobe measurements (n = 10/condition) of C-11-ABP688. Time-activity curves were extracted, and the nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) was calculated by use of the simplified reference tissue model with the cerebellum as a reference region. Results: C-11-ABP688 BPND measurements were highly reproducible (test-retest), and both small-animal PET and beta-microprobes were able to discriminate changes in C-11-ABP688 binding (cold blocking). The average small-animal PET BPND measurements in the test experiment for the caudate putamen, frontal cortex, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus were 2.58, 1.40, 1.60, 1.86, and 1.09, respectively. However, no significant differences in BPND measurements were observed with small-animal PET in the test and retest conditions on the one hand and the NAc and MK-801 conditions on the other hand for any of these regions. When beta-microprobes were used, the average BPND in the caudate putamen was 0.94, and no significant changes in the test and MK801 conditions were observed. Conclusion: Pharmacologic challenges with NAc and MK-801 did not affect the C-11-ABP688 BPND in the rat brain. These data suggest that the in vivo affinity of C-11-ABP688 for binding to an allosteric site of the metabotropic glutamate 5 receptor is not modulated by changes in glutamate levels and that C-11-ABP688 is not capable of measuring acute fluctuations in endogenous levels of glutamate in vivo in the rat brain.

The most widely used chelator for Cu-64 labeling of BFCs is DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N', N '',N '''-tretraacetic acid), even though this complex exhibits only moderate in vivo stability. In this study, we prepared a series of alternative chelator-peptide conjugates labeled with Cu-64, measured in vitro receptor binding affinities in human breast cancer T47D cells expressing the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) and compared their in vivo stability in mice. DOTA-, NOTA-(1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid), PCTA-(3,6,9,15-tetraazabicyclo[9.3.1]pentadeca-1(15),11,13-triene-3,6,9-triacetic acid), and Oxo-DO3A-(1-oxa-4,7, 10-triazacyclododecane-4,7,10-triacetic acid) peptide conjugates were prepared using H2N-Aoc-[D-Tyr(6),beta Ala(11), Thi(13), Nle(14)]bombesin(6-14) (BBN) as a peptide template. The BBN moiety was selected since it binds with high affinity to the GRPR, which is overexpressed on human breast cancer cells. A convenient synthetic approach for the attachment of aniline-BFC to peptides on solid support is also presented. To facilitate the attachment of the aniline-PCTA and aniline-Oxo-DO3A to the peptide via an amide bond, a succinyl spacer was introduced at the N-terminus of BBN. The partially protected aniline-BFC (p-H2N-Bn-PCTA(Ot-Bu)(3) or p-H2N-Bn-DO3A(Ot-Bu)(3)) was then coupled to the resulting N-terminal carboxylic acid preactivated with DEPBT/ClHOBt on resin. After cleavage and purification, the peptide-conjugates were labeled with Cu-64 using [Cu-64]Cu(OAc)(2) in 0.1 M ammonium acetate buffer at 100 degrees C for 15 min. Labeling efficacy was >90% for all peptides; Oxo-DO3A-BBN was incubated an additional 150 min at 100 degrees C to achieve this high yield. Specific activities varied from 76 to 101 TBq/mmol. Competition assays on T47D cells showed that all BFC-BBN complexes retained high affinity for the GRPR All BFC-BBN Cu-64-conjugates were stable for over 20 h when incubated at 37 degrees C; in mouse plasma samples. However, in vivo, only 37% of the Cu-64/Oxo-DO3A complex remained intact after 20 h while the Cu-64/DOTA-BBN complex was completely demetalated. In contrast, both Cu-64/NOTA- and Cu-64/PCTA-BBN conjugates remained stable during the 20 h time period. Our results indicate that it is possible to successfully conjugate aniline-BFC with peptide on solid support. Our data also show that Cu-64-labeled NOTA- and PCTA-BBN peptide conjugates are promising radiotracers for PET imaging of many human cancers overexpressing the GRP receptor.

NAUNYN-SCHMIEDEBERGS ARCHIVES OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						bladder; gender; muscarinic receptor; phospholipase C; G-protein; contraction	PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; SMOOTH-MUSCLE; ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; MEDIATE CONTRACTION; IN-VITRO; SUBTYPES; DETRUSOR; POPULATION; SYMPTOMS	Since symptoms of bladder dysfunction occur more frequently in women than in men and since muscarinic receptors are the physiologically most important system to mediate bladder contraction, we have compared the number, subtype distribution and function of muscarinic receptors in bladders from male and female rats. Muscarinic receptor function was also assessed in bladder strips from male and female human bladder. Male and female rats expressed a similar number of muscarinic receptors (144+/-5 vs. 140+/-6 fmol/mg protein in saturation radioligand binding). While competition binding curves for the moderately M-2-selective methoctramine were not consistently better fitted by a two-site model, most competition curves for the M-3-selective darifenacin were biphasic and yielded 29+/-10% and 31+/-7% high affinity sites (corresponding to M-3 receptors) in male and females, respectively. Immunoreactivity of alpha-subunits of the G-proteins G(q/11), G(i1/2), G(i3) and G(s) did not significantly differ between both genders. The muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol similarly stimulated inositol phosphate accumulation in bladder slices from male and female rats with calculated maximum responses of 69+/-17 and 77+/-18% over basal and pEC(50) values of 4.90+/-0.45 and 4.40+/-0.46, respectively. While darifenacin inhibited carbachol-stimulated inositol phosphate formation approximately 100-fold more potently than methoctramine, each antagonist was similarly potent in both genders. Carbachol concentration-dependently contracted bladder strips with a pEC(50) of 5.66+/-0.05 and 5.72+/-0.06 and maximum effects of 4.3+/-0.1 and 4.2+/-0.2 mN/mg wet weight in male and female rats, respectively. The con-tractile effect of carbachol was concentration-dependently antagonised by the non-selective atropine (1-30 nM), the M-1-selective pirenzepine (1-30 M), the M-2-selective methoctramine (1-10 muM) and the M-3-selective darifenacin (10-100 nM), with the latter exhibiting a partly unsurmountable antagonism. The overall potency of all four antagonists suggested that contraction was mediated predominantly if not exclusively by M-3 receptors with no appreciable differences between both male and female rats. Similarly, the maximum effects (4.4+/-0.6 vs. 4.4+/-2.4 mN/mg) and pEC(50) (6.07+/-0.05 vs. 6.32+/-0.14) of carbachol did not differ between genders in bladder samples from 25 consecutive patients. We conclude that number und function of muscarinic receptors and the relative roles of their M-2 and M-3 subtypes do not differ between urinary bladders of male and female rats; at least with regard to overall muscarinic responsiveness this situation appears to be similar in humans.

Anandamide (arachidonoyl ethanolamide, AEA), was measured in early L. variegatus embryos by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. AEA showed a strong developmental dynamic, increasing more than 5-fold between the 8-16 cell and mid-blastula 2 stage. 'Perturb-and-rescue' experiments in different sea urchin species and starfish showed that AEA blocked transition of embryos from the blastula to the gastrula stage, but had no effect on cleavage divisions, even at high doses. The non-selective cannabinoid receptor agonist, CP55940, had similar effects, but unlike AEA, also blocked cleavage divisions. CB1 antagonists, AEA transport inhibitors, and the cation channel transient membrane potential receptor V1 (TrpV1) agonist, arachidonoyl vanillic acid (arvanil), as well as arachidonoyl serotonin and dopamine (AA-5-HT, AA-DA) acted as rescue substances, partially or totally preventing abnormal embryonic phenotypes elicited by AEA or CP55940. Radioligand binding of [H-3] CP55940 to membrane preparations from embryos/larvae failed to show significant binding, consistent with the lack of CB receptor orthologs in the sea urchin genome. However, when binding was conducted on whole cell lysates, a small amount of [H-3] CP55940 binding was observed at the pluteus stage that was displaced by the CB2 antagonist, SR144528. Since AEA is known to bind with high affinity to TrpV1 and to certain G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the ability of arvanil, AA-5-HT and AA-DA to rescue embryos from AEA teratogenesis suggests that in sea urchins AEA and other endocannabinoids may utilize both Trp and GPCR orthologs. This possibility was explored using bioinformatic and phylogenetic tools to identify candidate orthologs in the S. purpuratus sea urchin genome. Candidate TrpA1 and TrpV1 orthologs were identified. The TrpA1 ortholog fell within a monophyletic clade, including both vertebrate and invertebrate orthologs, whereas the TrpV1 orthologs fell within two distinct TrpV-like invertebrate clades. One of the sea urchin TrpV orthologs was more closely related to the vertebrate epithelial calcium channels (TrpV5-6 family) than to the vertebrate TrpV1-4 family, as determined using profile-hidden Markov model (HMM) searches. Candidate dopamine and adrenergic GPCR orthologs were identified in the sea urchin genome, but no cannabinoid GPCRs were found, consistent with earlier studies. Candidate dopamine D-1, D-2 or alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor orthologs were identified as potential progenitors to the vertebrate cannabinoid receptors using HMM searches, depending on whether the multiple sequence alignment of CB receptor sequences consisted only of urochordate and cephalochordate sequences or also included vertebrate sequences.

Neuroinflammation After COVID-19 With Persistent Depressive and Cognitive Symptoms	JAMA PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; INFLAMMATION; RADIOLIGAND; BINDING; VOLUME	Importance Persistent depressive symptoms, often accompanied by cognitive symptoms, commonly occur after COVID-19 illness (hereinafter termed COVID-DC, DC for depressive and/or cognitive symptoms). In patients with COVID-DC, gliosis, an inflammatory change, was suspected, but measurements of gliosis had not been studied in the brain for this condition.Objective To determine whether translocator protein total distribution volume (TSPO V-T), a marker of gliosis that is quantifiable with positron emission tomography (PET), is elevated in the dorsal putamen, ventral striatum, prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and hippocampus of persons with COVID-DC.Design, Setting, and Participants This case-control study conducted at a tertiary care psychiatric hospital in Canada from April 1, 2021, to June 30, 2022, compared TSPO V-T of specific brain regions in 20 participants with COVID-DC with that in 20 healthy controls. The TSPO V-T was measured with fluorine F 18-labeled N-(2-(2-fluoroethoxy)benzyl)-N-(4-phenoxypyridin-3-yl)acetamide ([F-18]FEPPA) PET.Main Outcomes and Measures The TSPO V-T was measured in the dorsal putamen, ventral striatum, prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and hippocampus. Symptoms were measured with neuropsychological and psychological tests, prioritizing outcomes related to striatal function.Results The study population included 40 participants (mean [SD] age, 32.9 [12.3] years). The TSPO V-T across the regions of interest was greater in persons with COVID-DC (mean [SD] age, 32.7 [11.4] years; 12 [60%] women) compared with healthy control participants (mean [SD] age, 33.3 [13.9] years; 11 [55%] women): mean (SD) difference, 1.51 (4.47); 95% CI, 0.04-2.98; 1.51 divided by 9.20 (17%). The difference was most prominent in the ventral striatum (mean [SD] difference, 1.97 [4.88]; 95% CI, 0.36-3.58; 1.97 divided by 8.87 [22%]) and dorsal putamen (mean difference, 1.70 [4.25]; 95% CI, 0.34-3.06; 1.70 divided by 8.37 [20%]). Motor speed on the finger-tapping test negatively correlated with dorsal putamen TSPO V-T (r, -0.53; 95% CI, -0.79 to -0.09), and the 10 persons with the slowest speed among those with COVID-DC had higher dorsal putamen TSPO V-T than healthy persons by 2.3 (2.30 divided by 8.37 [27%]; SD, 2.46; 95% CI, 0.92-3.68).Conclusions and Relevance In this case-control study, TSPO V-T was higher in patients with COVID-DC. Greater TSPO V-T is evidence for an inflammatory change of elevated gliosis in the brain of an individual with COVID-DC. Gliosis may be consequent to inflammation, injury, or both, particularly in the ventral striatum and dorsal putamen, which may explain some persistent depressive and cognitive symptoms, including slowed motor speed, low motivation or energy, and anhedonia, after initially mild to moderate COVID-19 illness.

The C-terminal Phe was replaced by Gly, cyclohexylalanine (Cha), Tyr, all four isomers of beta-methylphenylalanine (beta-MePhe), and L- and D-tetrahydroisoquinoline carboxylic acid (Tic), resulting in analogues 3-11. For the synthesis of the beta-MePhe-containing analogues 6-9, crystallization was used to separate a mixture of all four isomers of beta-MePhe into the erythro pair of enantiomers (2S,3S, 2R,3R) and the threo pair of enantiomers (2S,3R, 2R,3S), which were then converted to Fmoc derivatives and used in two separate syntheses. Two diastereomeric peptides were obtained from each synthesis and were separated by RP-HPLC to yield enantiomerically pure 6-9. Substitution of Tyr for Phe caused no change in binding affinity at CGRP receptors. All other substitutions for Phe resulted in substantial reductions in binding affinity. Indeed, no binding was observed for analogues 7, 9, and 11, all of which contained a D-amino acid residue in the C-terminal position, and the binding affinities of the remaining analogues were >10-fold lower than that of h-alpha-CGRP(8-37). These data suggest that a conformationally flexible phenyl ring in the C-terminal position of h-alpha-CGRP(8-37) is preferred for high-affinity binding to CGRP receptors. Acetylation, benzoylation, and benzylation of the N-termini of h-alpha-CGRP(8-37) and h-beta-CGRP(8-37) produced analogues 12-14 and 16-18, respectively. A byproduct was isolated by RP-HPLC from the resin-cleaved crude product of each benzylated analogue, which was characterized as the dibenzylated derivative of h-alpha-CGRP(8-37) and h-beta-CGRP(8-37) (analogues 15 and 19, respectively). Amino acid analysis and H-1 NMR showed that the second benzyl group was located on the C4 carbon of the imidazole ring of His(10). Radioligand binding experiments showed that derivatizing the N-termini substantially increased binding affinities at CGRP receptors. The benzoylated and dibenzylated derivatives had the highest affinities, which were approximately 50-fold greater than those of h-alpha-CGRP(8-37). Functional experiments confirmed that the N-terminally derivatized analogues of h-alpha-CGRP(8-37) are antagonists that are more potent than h-alpha-CGRP(8-37). In conclusion, these studies underscore the importance of Phe(37) of h-alpha-CGRP(8-37) for binding to CGRP receptors and have identified the N-terminus and His(10) as two positions that can be used for the design of antagonists with increased affinity for CGRP receptors.

Potential ligands for PET imaging of PDE10A have been reported. Here, we report the first-in-human characterization of 2 new PDE10A radioligands, 2-(2-(3-(1-(2-fluoroethyl)-1H-indazol-6-yl)-7-methyl-4-oxo-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-2-yl)ethyl)-4-isopropoxyisoindoline-1,3-dione (F-18-MNI-654) and 2-(2-(3-(4-(2-fluoroethoxy)phenyl)-7-methyl-4-oxo-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-2-yl)ethyl)-4-isopropoxyisoindoline-1,3-dione (F-18-MNI-659), with the goal of selecting the best one for use in future studies interrogating pathophysiologic changes in neuropsychiatric disorders and aiding pharmaceutical development targeting PDE10A. Methods: Eleven healthy volunteers participated in this study (F-18-MNI-654 test-retest, 2 men; F-18-MNI-659 test-retest, 4 men and 1 woman; F-18-MNI-659 dosimetry, 2 men and 2 women). Brain PET images were acquired over 5.5 h for F-18-MNI-654 and over 3.5 h for F-18-MNI-659, and pharmacokinetic modeling with plasma- and reference-region (cerebellar cortex)-based methods was performed. Whole-body PET images were acquired over 6 h for F-18-MNI-659 and radiation dosimetry estimated with OLINDA. Results: Both radiotracers were similarly metabolized, with about 20% of intact parent remaining at 120 min after injection. PET time activity data demonstrated that F-18-MNI-654 kinetics were much slower than F-18-MNI-659 kinetics. For F-18-MNI-659, there was good agreement between the Logan and simplified reference tissue models for nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND), supporting noninvasive quantification, with test-retest variability less than 10% and intraclass correlation greater than 0.9. The F-18-MNI-659 effective dose was estimated at 0.024 mSv/MBq. Conclusion: PET imaging in the human brain with 2 novel PDE10A F-18 tracers is being reported. Noninvasive quantification of F-18-MNI-659 with the simplified reference tissue model using the cerebellum as a reference is possible. In addition, F-18-MNI-659 kinetics are fast enough for a good estimate of BPND with 90 min of data, with values around 3.0 in the basal ganglia. Finally, F-18-MNI-659 dosimetry is favorable and consistent with values reported for other PET radiotracers currently used in humans.

F-18-labelled N-alkyl tropane analogues were reported to be useful PET radioligands for DAT. However, the drawback of F-18-labelled tropane analogues is that N-alkyl on tropane is easily metabolized in vivo, which interferes with brain imaging. To develop a more in vivo stable DAT-targeted PET radioligand with high DAT affinity and specificity, in this study, we synthesized and compared a series of F-18-labelled novel deuterated N-fluoropropyl tropane derivatives [18F]4a-e for DAT tracing. Procedures: Five deuterated N-fluoropropyl-d6 tropane derivatives (4a-e) and corresponding non-deuterated compounds (6a-e) were synthesized, and their semi-inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were measured by competitive binding assay. The radioligands [F-18]4a-e and [F-18]6a-e were obtained by two-step one-pot radio-labelling reactions. The selectivity and specificity of these radioligands were evaluated by cellular uptake and microPET in normal rats. [F-18]4e was selected for further investigation with microPET of the PD model, autoradiography and biodistribution experiments and compared with its non-deuterated [F-18]6e. Finally, in vivo metabolic stability was analyzed by radio-HPLC. Results: Ten tropane compounds had high DAT affinity (IC50 = 2-21 nM), in which FP-CIT-d(6) (4e) had the lowest IC50 value of 2.7 nM. Radiolabelled [F-18]4a-e and [F-18]6a-e were obtained with radiochemical yields ranging from 10.6 +/- 2.8% to 35.1 +/- 5.4% with molar activities >20 GBq/ lmol and the radiochemical purities >99%. [F-18]4e showed the highest cell uptake (12%) and CFT inhibition efficacy (similar to 72%) among [F-18]4a-e. MicroPET results showed [F-18]4e has the highest target to non-target ratio (striatum/cerebellum). Therefore, [F-18]4e was then selected for further biological evaluation. Ex vivo autoradiography experiment confirmed high specific binding of [F-18]4e towards DAT. Biodistribution results indicated that [F-18]4e has a higher striatum/cerebellum value than [F-18]FP-CIT ([F-18]6e) at 30-120 min. Furthermore, in vivo metabolism studies in rats revealed improved stability of [F-18]4e as compared with that of [F-18]6e. Conclusions: The new probe [F-18]4e is a promising candidate with good DAT affinity, specificity and metabolic stability for PET imaging, and might provide reliable diagnosis, treatment and prognostic detection of DAT-related neuropsychiatric diseases.

Optimization of preprocessing strategies in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) neuroimaging: A [<SUP>11</SUP>C]DASB PET study	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Positron emission tomography; Preprocessing; Head motion; Optimization; Partial volume correction; Kinetic modeling; Test-retest; [C-11]DASB	SEROTONIN TRANSPORTER BINDING; REFERENCE TISSUE MODEL; QUANTIFICATION; REPRODUCIBILITY; RESOLUTION; HUMANS; MOTION; ACTIVATION; PARAMETERS; OCCUPANCY	Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is an important neuroimaging tool to quantify the distribution of specific molecules in the brain. The quantification is based on a series of individually designed data preprocessing steps (pipeline) and an optimal preprocessing strategy is per definition associated with less noise and improved statistical power, potentially allowing for more valid neurobiological interpretations. In spite of this, it is currently unclear how to design the best preprocessing pipeline and to what extent the choice of each preprocessing step in the pipeline minimizes subject-specific errors. To evaluate the impact of various preprocessing strategies, we systematically examined 384 different pipeline strategies in data from 30 healthy participants scanned twice with the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) radioligand [C-11]DASB. Five commonly used preprocessing steps with two to four options were investigated: (1) motion correction (MC) (2) co-registration (3) delineation of volumes of interest (VOI's) (4) partial volume correction (PVC), and (5) kinetic modeling. To quantitatively compare and evaluate the impact of various preprocessing strategies, we used the performance metrics: test-retest bias, within- and between-subject variability, the intraclass-correlation coefficient, and global signal-to-noise ratio. We also performed a power analysis to estimate the required sample size to detect either a 5% or 10% difference in 5-HTT binding as a function of preprocessing pipeline. The results showed a complex downstream dependency between the various preprocessing steps on the performance metrics. The choice of MC had the most profound effect on 5-HTT binding, prior to the effects caused by PVC and kinetic modeling, and the effects differed across VOI's. Notably, we observed a negative bias in 5-HTT binding across test and retest in 98% of pipelines, ranging from 0 to 6% depending on the pipeline. Optimization of the performance metrics revealed a trade-off in within- and between-subject variability at the group-level with opposite effects (i.e. minimization of within- subject variability increased between-subject variability and vice versa). The sample size required to detect a given effect size was also compromised by the preprocessing strategy, resulting in up to 80% increases in sample size needed to detect a 5% difference in 5-HTT binding. This is the first study to systematically investigate and demonstrate the effect of choosing different preprocessing strategies on the outcome of dynamic PET studies. We provide a framework to show how optimal and maximally powered neuroimaging results can be obtained by choosing appropriate preprocessing strategies and we provide recommendations depending on the study design. In addition, the results contribute to a better understanding of methodological uncertainty and variability in preprocessing decisions for future group- and/or longitudinal PET studies.

OBJECTIVE To ascertain whether there are racial disparities in molecular biomarkers for Alzheimer disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A total of 1255 participants (173 African Americans) were enrolled from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2015, in longitudinal studies at the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center at Washington University and completed a magnetic resonance imaging study of the brain and/or positron emission tomography of the brain with Pittsburgh compound B (radioligand for aggregated amyloid-beta) and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) assays for the concentrations of amyloid-beta 42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau181. Independent cross-sectional analyses were conducted from April 22, 2016, to August 27, 2018, for each biomarker modality with an analysis of variance or analysis of covariance including age, sex, educational level, race, apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon 4 allele status, and clinical status (normal cognition or dementia). All biomarker assessments were conducted without knowledge of the clinical status of the participants. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomes were hippocampal volumes adjusted for differences in intracranial volumes, global cerebral amyloid burden as transformed into standardized uptake value ratios (partial volume corrected), and CSF concentrations of amyloid-beta 42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau181. RESULTS Of the 1255 participants (707 women and 548 men; mean [SD] age, 70.8 [9.9] years), 116 of 173 African American participants (67.1%) and 724 of 1082 non-Hispanic white participants (66.9%) had normal cognition. There were no racial differences in the frequency of cerebral ischemic lesions noted on results of brain magnetic resonance imaging, mean cortical standardized uptake value ratios for Pittsburgh compound B, or for amyloid-beta 42 concentrations in CSF. However, in individuals with a reported family history of dementia, mean (SE) total hippocampal volumes were lower for African American participants than for white participants (6418.26 [138.97] vs 6990.50 [44.10] mm(3)). Mean (SE) CSF concentrations of total tau were lower in African American participants than in white participants (293.65 [34.61] vs 443.28 [18.20] pg/mL; P < .001), as were mean (SE) concentrations of phosphorylated tau181 (53.18 [4.91] vs 70.73 [2.46] pg/mL; P < .001). There was a significant race by APOE epsilon 4 interaction for both CSF total tau and phosphorylated tau181 such that only APOE epsilon 4-positive participants showed the racial differences. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The results of this study suggest that analyses of molecular biomarkers of Alzheimer disease should adjust for race. The lower CSF concentrations of total tau and phosphorylated tau181 in African American individuals appear to reflect a significant race by APOE epsilon 4 interaction, suggesting a differential effect of this Alzheimer risk variant in African American individuals compared with white individuals.

Using the AM1 molecular orbital method, conformational analysis of 1 around the pyrazole C3 substituent identified four distinct conformations designated Tg, Ts, Cg, and Cs. The energetic stability of these conformers followed the order Tg > Cg > Ts > Cs for the neutral (unprotonated) form of 1 and Ts > Tg > Cs > Cg for its piperidine N-protonated form. Unified pharmacophore models for the CB1 receptor ligands were developed by incorporating the protonated form of I into the superimposition model for the cannabinoid agonists 4-[4-(1,1dimethylheptyl)-2-hydroxyphenyl]perhydro-2alpha,6 -dihydroxynaphthalene (CP55244; 2) and the protonated form of (R)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-[(4-morpholinyl)methyl]pyrrolo[1,2,3-de]-1,4benzoxazin-6-yl](1-naphthalenyl)methanone (WIN55212-2; 3) reported previously (Shim et al. In Rational Drug Design Symposium Series; Parrill, A. L., Reddy, M. R., Eds.; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 1999; pp 165-184). Values of K-i for 1 and a series of 31 structural analogues were determined from radioligand binding analyses by competitive displacement of [H-3]CP55940 from cannabinoid receptors in a rat brain membrane preparation. Comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) was employed to construct three-dimensional (3D)-quantitative structure- activity relationship (QSAR) models for this data set as unprotonated species assuming the Tg, Cg, and Ts conformers and for the protonated species assuming the Ts, Tg, and Cs conformers. Values of the conventional r(2) and cross-validated r(2) (r(cv)(2)) associated with these CoMFA models exceeded the threshold for statistical robustness (7, 2 > 0.90) and internal predictive ability (r(cv)(2) greater than or equal to 0.50) in each of these six cases except for the protonated species assuming the Tg conformer (i.e., r(2) = 0.97; r(cv)(2) = 0.36). Results from conformational analyses, superimposition models, and 3D-QSAR models suggest that the N1 aromatic ring moiety of 1 dominates the steric binding interaction with the receptor in much the same way as does the C3 alkyl side chain of cannabinoid agonists and the C3 aroyl ring of the aminoalkylindole agonists. We also determined that several of the conformers considered in this study possess the proper spatial orientation and distinct electrostatic character to bind to the CB, receptor. We propose that the unique region in space occupied by the C5 aromatic ring of I might contribute to conferring antagonist activity. We further propose that the pyrazole C3 substituent of 1 might contribute to conferring either neutral antagonist or inverse agonist activity, depending upon the interaction with the receptor.

Neuroinflammation and protein aggregation co-localize across the frontotemporal dementia spectrum	BRAIN			English	Article						microglia; tau imaging; semantic dementia; primary progressive aphasia; neuropathology	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; MAPT MUTATION CARRIERS; IN-VIVO DETECTION; MICROGLIAL ACTIVATION; BEHAVIORAL VARIANT; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; PET; F-18-AV-1451; TRACER; PROGRANULIN	The clinical syndromes of frontotemporal dementia are clinically and neuropathologically heterogeneous, but processes such as neuroinflammation may be common across the disease spectrum. We investigated how neuroinflammation relates to the localization of tau and TDP-43 pathology, and to the heterogeneity of clinical disease. We used PET in vivo with (i) C-11-PK-11195, a marker of activated microglia and a proxy index of neuroinflammation; and (ii) F-18-AV-1451, a radioligand with increased binding to pathologically affected regions in tauopathies and TDP-43-related disease, and which is used as a surrogate marker of non-amyloid-a protein aggregation. We assessed 31 patients with frontotemporal dementia (10 with behavioural variant, 11 with the semantic variant and 10 with the non-fluent variant), 28 of whom underwent both F-18-AV-1451 and C-11-PK-11195 PET, and matched control subjects (14 for (18)FAV-1451 and 15 for C-11-PK-11195). We used a univariate region of interest analysis, a paired correlation analysis of the regional relationship between binding distributions of the two ligands, a principal component analysis of the spatial distributions of binding, and a multivariate analysis of the distribution of binding that explicitly controls for individual differences in ligand affinity for TDP-43 and different tau isoforms. We found significant group-wise differences in C-11-PK-11195 binding between each patient group and controls in frontotemporal regions, in both a regions-of-interest analysis and in the comparison of principal spatial components of binding. (18)FAV-1451 binding was increased in semantic variant primary progressive aphasia compared to controls in the temporal regions, and both semantic variant primary progressive aphasia and behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia differed from controls in the expression of principal spatial components of binding, across temporal and frontotemporal cortex, respectively. There was a strong positive correlation between C-11-E'K-11195 and F-18-AV-1451 uptake in all disease groups, across widespread cortical regions. We confirmed this association with post-mortem quantification in 12 brains, demonstrating strong associations between the regional densities of microglia and neuropathology in FTLD-TDP (A), FTLD-TDP (C), and FTLD-Pick's. This was driven by amoeboid (activated) microglia, with no change in the density of ramified (sessile) microglia. The multivariate distribution of C-11-PK-11195 binding related better to dinical heterogeneity than did F-18-AV-1451: distinct spatial modes of neuroinflammation were associated with different frontotemporal dementia syndromes and supported accurate dassification of participants. These in vivo findings indicate a close association between neuroinflammation and protein aggregation in frontotemporal dementia. The inflammatory component may be important in shaping the clinical and neuropathological patterns of the diverse clinical syndromes of frontotemporal dementia.	[Bevan-Jones, W.

Theranostic Perspectives in Prostate Cancer with the Gastrin Releasing Peptide Receptor Antagonist NeoBOMB1: Preclinical and First Clinical Results	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						molecular tumor imaging; PET; SPECT; radionuclide therapy; theranostic applications; prostate cancer; gastrin releasing peptide receptor antagonist	BOMBESIN ANALOG; THERAPY; RADIOLIGAND; TC-99M; PET	We recently introduced the potent gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) antagonist Ga-68-SB3 (Ga-68-DOTA-p-aminomethylaniline-diglycolic acid-DPhe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Leu-NHEt), showing excellent tumor localizing efficacy in animal models and in patients. By replacement of the C-terminal Leu(13)-Met(14)-NH2 dipeptide of SB3 by Sta(13)-Leu(14)-NH2, the novel GRPR antagonist NeoBOMB1 was generated and labeled with different radiometals for theranostic use. We herein report on the biologic profile of resulting 67168Ga-, In-111-, and Lu-177-NeoBOMB1 radioligands in GRPR-expressing cells and mouse models. The first evidence of prostate cancer lesion visualization in men using 68Ga-NeoBOMB1 and PET/CT is also presented. Methods: NeoBOMB1 was radiolabeled with 67168Ga, In-111, and Lu-177 according to published protocols. The respective metalated species natGa-, natin-, and natLu-NeoBOMB1 were also synthesized and used in competition binding experiments against [1261-Tyr4]BBN in GRPRpositive PC-3 cell membranes. Internalization of Ga-67-, (111) In-, and Lu-177-NeoBOMB1 radioligands was studied in PC-3 cells at 37 C, and their metabolic stability in peripheral mouse blood was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of blood samples. Biodistribution was performed by injecting a 67Ga-, or Lu-177-NeoBOMB1 bolus (74, 74, or 370 kBq, respectively, 100 mu t, 10 pmol total peptide 40 nmol Tyro-BBN: for in vivo GRPR blockade) in severe combined immunodeficiency mice bearing PC-3 xenografts. PET/CT images with 68Ga-NeoBOMB1 were acquired in prostate cancer patients. Results: NeoBOMB1 and natGa-, natIn-, and natLuNeoBOMB1 bound to GRPR with high affinity (half maximal inhibitory concentration, 1-2 nM). Ga-67-, In-111-, and Lu-177-NeoBOMB1 specifically and strongly bound on the cell membrane of PC-3 cells displaying low internalization, as expected for receptor antagonists. They showed excellent metabolic stability in peripheral mouse blood (>95% intact at 5 min after injection). After injection in mice, all 3 (Ga-67-, and Lu-177-NeoBOMB1) showed comparably high and GRPR-specific uptake in the PC-3 xenografts (e.g., 30.6 3.9, 28.6 6.0, and >35 percentage injected dose per gram at 4 h after injection, respectively), clearing from background predominantly via the kidneys. During a translational study in prostate cancer patients, 68Ga-NeoBOMB1 rapidly localized in pathologic lesions, achieving high-contrast imaging. Conclusion: The GRPR antagonist radioligands Ga-67-, In-111-, and Lu-177-NeoBOMB1, independent of the radiometal applied, have shown comparable behavior in prostate cancer models, in favor of future theranostic use in GRPR-positive cancer patients. Such translational prospects were further supported by the successful visualization of prostate cancer lesions in men using Ga-68-NeoBOMB1 and PET/CT.

In continuation of our previous work on 2,4,6-tri-substituted 1,3,5-triazines as potent CB2 agonists, we synthesized an additional series of more polar analogues (1-10), which were found to possess high CB2R agonist activity with enhanced water solubility. The most potent compound in the series was N-(adamantan-1-yl)-4-ethoxy-6-(4-(2-fluoroethyl)piperazin-1-yl)-1,3,5-triazin-2-amine (9) with EC50 value of 0.60 nM. To further evaluate the biological effects of the compounds, the selected compounds were tested in vitro against four different cell lines. A human retinal pigment epithelial cell line (ARPE-19) was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the compounds whereas an androgen-sensitive human prostate adenocarcinoma cell line (LNCaP), a Jurkat leukemia cell line and a C8161 melanoma cell line were used to assess the antiproliferative activity of the compounds. The most interesting results were obtained for N-(adamantan-1-yl)-4-ethoxy-6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1,3,5-triazin-2-amine (6), which induced cell viability decrease in prostate and leukemia cell lines, and diminished proliferation of C8161 melanoma cells. The results could be reversed in leukemia cells with the selective CB2R antagonist AM630, whereas in prostate cells the AM630 induced a significant cell viability decrease with a mechanism probably unlinked to CB2 cannabinoid receptor. The antiproliferative effect of 6 on the melanoma cells seemed not to be mediated via the CB1R or CB2R. No cytotoxicity was detected against ARPE-19 cell line at concentrations of 1 and 10 mu M for compound 6. However, at 30 mu M concentration the compound 6 decreased the cell viability. Finally, in order to estimate in vivo behavior of these compounds, F-18 labeled PET ligand, N-cyclopentyl-4-ethoxy-6-(4-(2-fluoro-18-thyl)piperazin-1-yl-1,3,5-triazin-2-amine ([F-18]5), was synthesized and its biodistribution was determined in healthy male Sprague Dawley rats. As a result, the tracer showed a rapid (<15 min) elimination in urine accompanied by a slower excretion via the hepatobiliary route. In conclusion, we further demonstrated that 1,3,5-triazine scaffold serves as a suitable template for the design of highly potent CB2R agonists with reasonable water solubility properties. The compounds may be useful when studying the role of the endocannabinoid system in different diseases. The triazine scaffold is also a promising candidate for the development of new CB2R PET ligands. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AEA inhibited [H-3]CP55,940 binding in rat whole-brain membranes with a K-i of 428 nm (346-510 nM, Hill slope = -1.33, n = 3). 3 ODA competitively inhibited [H-3]CP55,940 binding in human CB1 (hCB(1)) cell membranes with a K-i value of 8.13 muM (4.97-13.32 muM, n = 2). In human CB2 transfected (hCB(2)) HEK-293T cell membranes, 100 muM ODA produced only a partial (42.5 +/- 7%) inhibition of [H-3]CP55,940 binding. 4 ODA stimulated [S-35]GTPgammaS binding in a concentration-dependent manner (EC50 = 1.64 muM (0.29-9.32 muM), R-2 = 0.99, n = 4-9), with maximal stimulation of 188 +/- 9% of basal at 100 muM. AEA stimulated [S-35]GTPgammaS binding with an EC50 of 10.43 muM (4.45-24.42 muM, R-2 = 1.00, n = 3, 195 +/- 4% of basal at 300 muM). Traps-oleamide (trans-ODA) failed to significantly stimulate [S-35]GTPgammaS binding at concentrations up to 100 muM. 5 ODA (10 muM)-stimulated [S-35]GTPgammaS binding was reversed by the selective CB1 antagonist SR141716A (IC50 = 2.11 nM (0.32-13.77 nm), R-2 =1.00, n = 6). 6 The anatomical distribution of ODA-stimulated [S-35]GTPgammaS binding in rat brain sections was indistinguishable from that of HU210. Increases of similar magnitude were observed due to both agonists in the striatum, cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. 7 ODA (10 muM) significantly inhibited forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP (CAMP) accumulation in mouse neuroblastoma N1E 115 cells (P = 0.02, n = 11). ODA-mediated inhibition was completely reversed by 1 muM SR141716A (P < 0.001, n = 11) and was also reversed by pretreatment with 300 ng ml(-1) pertussis toxin (P < 0.001, n = 6). 8 These data demonstrate that ODA is a full cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonist. Therefore, in addition to allosteric modulation of other receptors and possible entourage effects due to fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibition, the effects of ODA may be mediated directly via the CB1 receptor.

Altered receptor and serotonin transporter function are considered to be associated with mental disorders. Our investigation aimed on the density of the HT1A receptor in mesiotemporal cortex (MTC) and raphe measured by F18-Mefway in patients with MDD. METHODS: Patients with untreated clinically suspected major depressive episode were recruited from June 2012 to May 2014.49 patients were included into the study: 36 patients (73%) were identified as responders, whereas 13 (27%) were non-responders. Gender distribution was 26 men (56%) and 23 women (44%). For treatment, only a standard medication of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with escitalopram in a range of 10-20 mg/day was permitted. Responders were defined by improvement of the MADRS >= 50%. Visually MTC had the highest uptake of F18-Mefway among all brain regions, an asymmetry could not be observed in any patient An elliptical region was drawn over the amygdala and hippocampus area and a small circular region was drawn over the raphe nuclei. All data were calculated related to (unspecific) cerebellar uptake. RESULTS: The quotient of the right MTC was 5.00 [4.33; 5.50] in all patients, in responders 5.00 [4.00; 5.75] and in non-responders 5.00 [4.50; 5.50] (P=0.56). The quotient of the left MTC presented with a median level of 4.50 [4.50; 5.50] in all persons. The responders had 4.50 [4.50; 5.75] which was not statistically significant to the data of the non-responders with 5.00 [4.50; 5.50] at P=0.64. The raphe had a median quotient of 2.50 [2.00; 3.00] in all and the cohort of responders, whereas non-responders had 2.50 [2.00; 2.50] (P=0.61). Also the absolute values of SUV in the three brain regions were not statistically different between the cohorts. Additionally, we did not find any sex-related differences in our patient group. CONCLUSIONS: Serotonin 1A receptor density can be assessed efficiently by F18-Mefway and PET-CT in patients with MDE. The method can be estimated as a possible tool for clinical and academic investigation, marked tracer uptake can constantly be observed at MTC and the raphe. Anyhow, under conditions of real life in patient care, it is not possible to distinguish patients with a good prognosis who will respond to standard SSRI therapy from non-responders who would benefit from a different therapeutic approach starting earlier.

A Non-imaging High Throughput Approach to Chemical Library Screening at the Unmodified Adenosine-A<sub>3</sub> Receptor in Living Cells	FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						adenosine receptors; fluorescent ligands; adenosine A(3) receptor; high throughput screening; LOPAC library	ANTAGONIST RADIOLIGAND; LIGAND-BINDING; FLOW-CYTOMETRY; FLUORESCENT; AGONIST; PHARMACOLOGY; DERIVATIVES; AFFINITY; POTENT; MECHANISM	Recent advances in fluorescent ligand technology have enabled the study of G protein-coupled receptors in their native environment without the need for genetic modification such as addition of N-terminal fluorescent or bioluminescent tags. Here, we have used a non-imaging plate reader (PHERAstar FS) to monitor the binding of fluorescent ligands to the human adenosine-A(3) receptor (A(3)AR; CA200645 and AV039), stably expressed in CHO-K1 cells. To verify that this method was suitable for the study of other GPCRs, assays at the human adenosine-A(1) receptor, and beta(1) and beta(2) adrenoceptors (beta(1) AR and beta(2) AR; BODIPY-TMR-CGP-12177) were also carried out. Affinity values determined for the binding of the fluorescent ligands CA200645 and AV039 to A(3)AR for a range of classical adenosine receptor antagonists were consistent with A(3)AR pharmacology and correlated well (R-2 = 0.94) with equivalent data obtained using a confocal imaging plate reader (Image Xpress Ultra). The binding of BODIPY-TMR-CGP-12177 to the beta(1) AR was potently inhibited by low concentrations of the beta(1)-selective antagonist CGP 20712A (pKi 9.68) but not by the beta(2)-selective antagonist ICI 118551(pK(i) 7.40). Furthermore, in experiments conducted in CHO-K1 cells expressing the beta(2) AR this affinity order was reversed with ICI 118551 showing the highest affinity (pK(i) 8.73) and CGP20712A (pK(i) 5.68) the lowest affinity. To determine whether the faster data acquisition of the non-imaging plate reader (similar to 3 min per 96-well plate) was suitable for high throughput screening (HTS), we screened the LOPAC library for inhibitors of the binding of CA200645 to the A(3)AR. From the initial 1,263 compounds evaluated, 67 hits (defined as those that inhibited the total binding of 25 nM CA200645 by >= 40%) were identified. All compounds within the library that had medium to high affinity for the A(3)AR (pK(i) = 6) were successfully identified. We found three novel compounds in the library that displayed unexpected sub-micromolar affinity for the A(3)AR. These were K114 (pK(i) 6.43), retinoic acid p-hydroxyanilide (pK(i) 6.13) and SU 6556 (pK(i) 6.17). Molecular docking of these latter three LOPAC library members provided a plausible set of binding poses within the vicinity of the established orthosteric A(3)AR binding pocket. A plate reader based library screening using an untagged receptor is therefore possible using fluorescent ligand opening the possibility of its use in compound screening at natively expressed receptors.

Synthesis and Evaluation in Rats of the Dopamine D<sub>2/3</sub> Receptor Agonist <SUP>18</SUP>F-AMC20 as a Potential Radioligand for PET	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						agonist tracer; dopamine receptor; PET; F-18	HIGH-AFFINITY STATE; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; IN-VIVO; DRUG-ABUSE; RADIOTRACER; SERIES; BRAIN	Dopamine D-2/3 receptor (D2/3R) agonist PET tracers are better suited for the imaging of synaptic dopaminergic neurotransmission than D2/3R antagonists and may also offer the opportunity to study in vivo the high-affinity state of D2/3R (D(2/3)RHigh). With the aim to develop F-18-labeled D2/3R agonists suitable for widespread clinical application, we report here on the synthesis and in vitro and in vivo evaluation of a D2/3R agonist ligand from the aminomethyl chromane (AMC) class-(R)-2-[(4-F-18-fluorobenzylamino) methyl] chroman-7-ol (F-18-AMC20). Methods: In vitro affinities of AMC20 toward dopaminergic receptor subtypes were measured in membrane homogenates prepared from HEK293 cells expressing human dopamine receptors. Agonism of AMC20 was assessed in the arrestin recruitment assay in Chinese hamster ovary-K-1 cells expressing the long isoform of D2R (D(2)RLong). D2/3R-specific binding of F-18-AMC20 was evaluated in brain slices of Sprague-Dawley rats by in vitro autoradiography and in living rats by in vivo small-animal PET imaging and ex vivo autoradiography. PET data were analyzed with 1-and 2-tissue compartmental models, the simplified reference tissue model, and Logan graphical analysis. Specificity of binding was tested by blocking D2/3R with raclopride (coincubation with 10 mu M in vitro, administration of 1.0 mg/kg in vivo). Results: In membrane homogenates, AMC20 demonstrated picomolar affinity at D(2)RHigh (mean inhibition constant [K-i] = 85 pM) and excellent selectivity against the low-affinity state of D2R (D(2)RLow) (mean K-i = 84 nM, 988-fold selectivity) and D-1-like receptors (mean Ki 5 5,062 nM at D1R). The efficacy of AMC20 was 90% of that of dopamine in the arrestin recruitment assay. Up to 70% of total binding of F-18-AMC20 in the D2/3R-rich striatum in rat brain slices was D2/3R-specific; in living rats, the uptake ratio between the striatum and the D2/3R-poor cerebellum reached 2.0-2.5, depending on the measurement method. Radiometabolites of F-18-AMC20 did not enter the brain. Striatal binding potential of F-18-AMC20 varied between 0.49 and 0.59 depending on the estimation method. Pretreatment with 1 mg of raclopride per kilogram reduced the apparent specific binding of F-18-AMC20 in the striatum. Conclusion: F-18-AMC20 shows specific binding to D2/3R in the striatum of living rats. Further optimization of the chemical structure of F-18-AMC20 can lead to F-18-labeled D-2/3 agonist PET tracers more suitable for in vivo clinical application.	[Shalgunov, Vladimir; Dierckx, Rudi A.

N-Terminal Modifications Improve the Receptor Affinity and Pharmacokinetics of Radiolabeled Peptidic Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptor Antagonists: Examples of <SUP>68</SUP>Ga- and <SUP>64</SUP>Cu-Labeled Peptides for PET Imaging	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						gastrin-releasing peptide receptor antagonists; Ga-68; Cu-64; PET imaging	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; CONJUGATED BOMBESIN ANTAGONIST; IN-VIVO EVALUATION; PROSTATE-CANCER; POSITIVE TUMORS; TARGETING VECTOR; BIOLOGICAL EVALUATION; ANALOGS; GRPR; AGONISTS	Gastrin-releasing peptide receptors (GRPrs) are overexpressed on a variety of human cancers, providing the opportunity for peptide receptor targeting via radiolabeled bombesin-based peptides. As part of our ongoing investigations into the development of improved GRPr antagonists, this study aimed at verifying whether and how N-terminal modulations improve the affinity and pharmacokinetics of radiolabeled GRPr antagonists. Methods: The potent GRPr antagonist MJ9, Pip-o-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Sta-Leu-NH2 (Pip, 4-amino-1-carboxymethyl-piperidine), was conjugated to 1,4,7-triazacyclononane, 1-glutaric acid-4,7 acetic acid (NODAGA), and 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (NOTA) and radiolabeled with Ga-66 and Cu-64. The GRPr affinity of the corresponding metalloconjugates was determined using I-125-Tyr(4)-BN as a radioligand. The labeling efficiency of Ga-68(3+) was compared between NODAGA-MJ9 and NOTA-MJ9 in acetate buffer, at room temperature and at 95 degrees C. The Ga-68 and Cu-64 conjugates were further evaluated in vivo in PC3 tumor xenografts by biodistribution and PET imaging studies. Results: The half maximum inhibitory concentrations of all the metalloconjugates are in the high picomolar-low nanomolar range, and these are the most affine-radiolabeled GRPr antagonists we have studied so far in our laboratory. NODAGA-MJ9 incorporates Ga-68(3+) nearly quantitatively (>98%) at room temperature within 10 min and at much lower peptide concentrations (1.4 x 10(-6) M) than NOTA-MJ9, for which the labeling yield was approximately 45% under the same conditions and increased to 75% at 95 degrees C for 5 min. Biodistribution studies showed high and specific tumor uptake, with a maximum of 23.3 +/- 2.0 percentage injected activity per gram of tissue (%IA/g) for Ga-68-NOTA-MJ9 and 16.7 +/- 2.0 %IA/g for Ga-68-NODAGA-MJ9 at 1 h after injection. The acquisition of PET images with the Cu-64-MJ9 conjugates at later time points clearly showed the efficient clearance of the accumulated activity from the background already at 4 h after injection, whereas tumor uptake still remained high. The high pancreas uptake for all radiotracers at 1 h after injection was rapidly washed out, resulting in an increased tumor-to-pancreas ratio at later time points. Conclusion: We have developed 2 GRPr antagonistic radioligands, which are improved in terms of binding affinity and overall biodistribution profile. Their promising in vivo pharmacokinetic performance may contribute to the improvement of the diagnostic imaging of tumors overexpressing GRPr.

The aim of this study was to design new PSMA ligands modified with an albumin-binding moiety in order to optimize their tissue distribution profile. The compounds were prepared by conjugation of a urea-based PSMA-binding entity, a DOTA chelator, and 4-( p-iodophenyl)butyric acid using multistep solid phase synthesis. The three ligands (PSMA-ALB-02, PSMA-ALB-05, and PSMA-ALB-07) were designed with varying linker entities. Radiolabeling with Lu-177 was performed at a specific activity of up to 50 MBq/nmol resulting in radioligands of >98% radiochemical purity and high stability. In vitro investigations revealed high binding of all three PSMA radioligands to mouse (>64%) and human plasma proteins (>94%). Uptake and internalization into PSMA-positive PC-3 PIP tumor cells was equally high for all radioligands. Negligible accumulation was found in PSMA-negative PC-3 flu cells, indicating PSMA-specific binding of all radioligands. Biodistribution and imaging studies performed in PC-3 PIP/flu tumor-bearing mice showed enhanced blood circulation of the new radioligands when compared to the clinically employed (17)7Lu-PSMA-617. The PC-3 PIP tumor uptake of all three radioligands was very high (76.4 +/- 2.5% IA/g, 79.4 +/- 11.1% IA/g, and 84.6 +/- 14.2% IA/g, respectively) at 24 h post injection (p.i.) resulting in tumor-to-blood ratios of similar to 176, similar to 48, and similar to 107, respectively, whereas uptake into PC-3 flu tumors was negligible. Kidney uptake at 24 h p.i. was lowest for Lu-177-PSMA-ALB-02 (10.7 +/- 0.92% IA/g), while Lu-177-PSMA-ALB-05 and Lu-177-PSMA-ALB-07 showed higher renal retention (23.9 +/- 4.02% IA/g and 51.9 +/- 6.34% IA/g, respectively). Tumor-to-background ratios calculated from values of the area under the curve (AUC) of time-dependent biodistribution data were in favor of Lu-177-PSMA-ALB-02 (tumor-to-blood, 46; tumor-to-kidney, 5.9) when compared to Lu-177-PSMA-ALB-05 (17 and 3.7, respectively) and Lu-177-PSMA-ALB-07 (39 and 2.1, respectively). The high accumulation of the radioligands in PC-3 PIP tumors was visualized on SPECT/CT images demonstrating increasing tumor-to-kidney ratios over time. Taking all of the characteristics into account, Lu-177-PSMA-ALB-02 emerged as the most promising candidate. The applied concept may be attractive for future clinical translation potentially enabling more potent and convenient prostate cancer radionuclide therapy.

The main reason for this appears to be the high nonspecific (non-NET) binding exhibited by many of these tracers, which makes the identification of a reference region difficult. With other PET ligands the use of a reference region increases the reproducibility of the outcome measure in test/retest studies. The focus of this work is to identify a suitable reference region or means of normalizing data for the NET ligands investigated. Methods: We have analyzed the results of PET studies in the baboon brain with labeled reboxetine derivatives (S,S)-[C-11]O-methyl reboxetine (SS-MRB), (S,S)-[F-18]fluororeboxetine (SS-FRB) as well as O-[C-11]nisoxetine and N-[C-11]nisoxetine (NIS), and, for comparison, the less active (R,R) enantiomers (RR-MRB, RR-FRB) in terms of the distribution volume (DV) using measured arterial input functions. Results: (1) For a given subject, a large variation in DV for successive baseline studies was observed in regions with both high and low NET density. (2) The occipital cortex and the basal ganglia were found to be the regions with the smallest change between baseline (SS-MRB) and pretreatment with cocaine, and were therefore used as a composite reference region for calculation of a distribution volume ratio (DVR). (3) The variability [as measured by the coefficient of variation (CV)=standard deviation/mean] in the distribution volume ratio (DVR) of thalamus (to reference region) was considerably reduced over that of the DV using this composite reference region. (4) Pretreatment with nisoxetine (1.0 mg/kg 10 min prior to tracer) in one study produced (in decreasing order) reductions in thalamus, cerebellum, cingulate and frontal cortex consistent with known NET densities. (5) [C-11]Nisoxetine had a higher background non-NET binding (DV) than the other tracers reported here with basal ganglia (a non-NET region) higher than thalamus. Conclusions: The reboxetine derivatives show a lot of promise as tracers for human PET studies of the norepinephrine system. We have identified a strategy for normalizing DVs to a reference region with the understanding that the DVR for these tracers may not be related to the binding potential in the same way as, for example, for the dopamine tracers, since the non-NET binding may differ between the target and nontarget regions. From our baboon studies the average DVR for thalamus (n = 18) for SS-MRB is 1.8; however, the lower limit is most likely less than 1 due to this difference in non-NET binding.

John			Positron Emission Tomographic Imaging of the Serotonergic System and Prediction of Risk and Lethality of Future Suicidal Behavior	JAMA PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; RECEPTOR-BINDING; 1A BINDING; ATTEMPTERS; BRAIN; SCALE; QUANTIFICATION; TRANSPORTER	IMPORTANCE Biomarkers that predict suicidal behavior, especially highly lethal behavior, are urgently needed. In cross-sectional studies, individuals with depression who attempt suicide have lower midbrain serotonin transporter binding potential compared with those who do not attempt suicide, and higher serotonin(1A) binding potential in the raphe nuclei (RN) is associated with greater lethality of past suicide attempts and suicidal intent and ideation. OBJECTIVES To determine whether serotonin transporter binding potential in the lower midbrain predicts future suicide attempts and whether higher RN serotonin(1A) binding potential predicts future suicidal ideation and intent and lethality of future suicide attempts. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this prospective 2-year observational study, a well-characterized cohort of 100 patients presenting for treatment of a major depressive episode of at least moderate severity underwent positron emission tomography using carbon 11-labeled N-(2-(1-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl)ethyl))-N-(2-pyridyl)-cyclohexanecarboxamide ([C-11]WAY-100635), a serotonin(1A) antagonist; a subset of 50 patients also underwent imaging with carbon 11-labeled 3-amino-4-(2-dimethylaminomethyl-phenylsulfanyl)- benzonitrile ([C-11]DASB), a serotonin transporter radioligand. Imaging was performed at Columbia University Medical Center from May 3, 1999, to March 11, 2008. Follow-up was completed on May 28, 2010, and data were analyzed from August 1, 2013, to March 1, 2016. EXPOSURES Patients were treated naturalistically in the community and followed up for 2 years with documentation of suicidal behavior, its lethality, and suicidal ideation and intent. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Suicide attempt or suicide. RESULTS Of the 100 patients undergoing follow-up for more than 2 years (39 men; 61 women; mean [SD] age, 40.2 [11.2] years), 15 made suicide attempts, including 2 who died by suicide. Higher RN serotonin(1A) binding potential predicted more suicidal ideation at 3 (b = 0.02; t = 3.45; P = .001) and 12 (b = 0.02; t = 3.63; P = .001) months and greater lethality of subsequent suicidal behavior (b = 0.08; t = 2.89; P = .01). Exploratory analyses suggest that the serotonin(1A) binding potential of the insula (t = 2.41; P = .04), anterior cingulate (t = 2.27; P = .04), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (t = 2.44; P = .03) were also predictive of lethality. Contrary to our hypotheses, suicidal intent was not predicted by serotonin(1A) binding potential in any brain region (F-1,F-10 = 0.83; P = .38), and midbrain serotonin transporter binding potential did not predict future attempts (log-rank chi(2)(1) = 0.4; P = .54), possibly owing to low power. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Greater RN serotonin(1A) binding potential predicted higher suicidal ideation and more lethal suicidal behavior during a 2-year period. This effect may be mediated through less serotonin neuron firing and release, which affects mood and suicidal ideation and thereby decision making.

Ann Nucl Med, 10.1007/s12149-018-1236-1, 2018). The aim of this study was to assess the biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of diagnostic dosages of F-18-FPYBF-2 in normal healthy volunteers as a first-in-man study. Four normal healthy volunteers (male: 3, female: 1; mean age: 40 +/- 17; age range 25-56) were included and underwent F-18-FPYBF-2 PET/CT study for the evaluation of radiation exposure and pharmacokinetics. A 10-min dynamic PET/CT scan of the body (chest and abdomen) was performed at 0-10 min and a 15-min whole-body static scan was performed six times after the injection of F-18-FPYBF-2. After reconstructing PET and CT image data, individual organ time-activity curves were estimated by fitting volume of interest data from the dynamic scan and whole-body scans. The OLINDA/EXM version 2.0 software was used to determine the whole-body effective doses. Dynamic PET imaging demonstrated that the hepatobiliary and renal systems were the principal pathways of clearance of F-18-FPYBF-2. High uptake in the liver and the gall bladder, the stomach, and the kidneys were demonstrated, followed by the intestines and the urinary bladder. The ED for the adult dosimetric model was estimated to be 8.48 +/- 1.25 A mu Sv/MBq. The higher absorbed doses were estimated for the liver (28.98 +/- 12.49 and 36.21 +/- 15.64 A mu Gy/MBq), the brain (20.93 +/- 4.56 and 23.05 +/- 5.03A mu Gy/MBq), the osteogenic cells (9.67 +/- 1.67 and 10.29 +/- 1.70 A mu Gy/MBq), the small intestines (9.12 +/- 2.61 and 11.12 +/- 3.15 A mu Gy/MBq), and the kidneys (7.81 +/- 2.62 and 8.71 +/- 2.90 A mu Gy/MBq) for male and female, respectively. The ED for the adult dosimetric model was similar to those of other agents used for amyloid PET imaging. The diagnostic dosage of 185-370 MBq of F-18-FPYBF-2 was considered to be acceptable for administration in patients as a diagnostic tool for the evaluation of AD.

However, early treatment resistance is common. This LuPIN substudy aimed to determine the prognostic value of posttreatment quantitative PET for PSA progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) with 177Lu-PSMA-617 therapy.Methods: Fifty-six men with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer were enrolled in the LuPIN trial and received up to 6 doses of 177Lu-PSMA-617 and a radiation sensitizer (NOX66). 68Ga-PSMA-11 and 18F-FDG PET/CT, diagnostic CT, and bone scanning were performed at study entry and exit. Quantitative analysis tracked change in total tumor vol-ume (TTV) and SUV. Univariable and multivariable analyses were con-ducted to examine the association of change in TTV (continuous and >30%), SUVmax, PSA, and radiographic progression with PSA PFS and OS.Results: All men (37/56) who underwent both screening and post-treatment molecular imaging were analyzed; 70% (26/37) had a PSA response of more than 50%. Median PSA PFS was 8.6 mo, and median OS was 22 mo. Clinical progression had occurred at trial exit in 54% (20/37). In response to treatment, a reduced PSMA SUVmax was demon-strated in 95% (35/37) and a reduced PSMA TTV in 68% (25/37). An increase in PSMA TTV by at least 30% was associated with worse OS (median, 10.2 vs. 23.6 mo; P = 0.002). Change in PSMA SUVmax was not associated with PSA PFS or OS. 18F-FDG SUVmax was reduced in 51% (18/35) and 18F-FDG TTV in 67% (22/35). An increased 18F-FDG SUVmax was associated with worse OS (median, 20.7 vs. 25.7 mo; P < 0.01). An 18F-FDG TTV increase by more than 30% was associated with a short PSA PFS (median, 3.5 vs. 8.6 mo; P < 0.001) but not OS. Both PSA and radiographic progression were associated with shorter OS (median, 14.5 vs. 25.7 mo [P < 0.001] and 12.2 vs. 23.6 mo [P = 0.002]). On multivariable analysis, only increased PSMA TTV and PSA progression remained independently prognostic of OS (hazard ratio, 5.1 [95% CI, 1.5-17.1; P = 0.008] and 3.5 [95% CI, 1.1-10.9; P = 0.03], respectively).Conclusion: Change in quantitative PSMA TTV has strong potential as a prognostic biomarker with 177Lu-PSMA-617 therapy, independent of 18F-FDG PET parameters, PSA, or radiographic progres-sion. Further research into the value of posttreatment PET as an imaging biomarker is warranted.

Scientists indicated that alpha(1A)-subtype blockade might be beneficial in restoring normal heart rhythm. Therefore, we aimed to determine the role of alpha(1)-adrenoceptors subtypes (i.e., alpha(1A) and alpha(1B)) in antiarrhythmic effect of six structurally similar derivatives of 2-methoxyphenylpiperazine. We compared the activity of studied compounds with carvedilol, which is beta(1) - and alpha(1)-adrenoceptors blocker with antioxidant properties. To evaluate the affinity for adrenergic receptors, we used radioligand methods. We investigated selectivity at alpha(1)-adrenoceptors subtypes using functional bioassays. We tested antiarrhythmic activity in adrenaline-induced (2011 mu g/kg i.v.), calcium chloride-induced (140 and 25 mg/kg i.v.) and barium chloride-induced (32 and 10 mg/kg i.v.) arrhythmia models in rats. We also evaluated the influence of studied compounds on blood pressure in rats, as well as lipid peroxidation. All studied compounds showed high affinity toward alpha(1)-adrenoceptors but no affinity for beta(1) receptors. Biofunctional studies revealed that the tested compounds blocked alpha(1A)-stronger than alpha(1B)-adrenoceptors, but except for HBK-19 they antagonized alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor weaker than alpha(1D)-subtype. HBK-19 showed the greatest difference in pA(2) values it blocked alpha(1A)-adrenoceptors around seven-fold stronger than (xi [3 subtype. All compounds showed prophylactic antiarrhythmic properties in adrenaline-induced arrhythmia, but only the activity of HBK-16, HBK-17, HBK-18, and HBK-19 (ED50 = 0.18-0.21) was comparable to that of carvedilol (ED50 = 0.36). All compounds reduced mortality in adrenaline-induced arrhythmia. HBK-16, HBK-17, HBK-18, and HBK-19 showed therapeutic antiarrhythmic properties in adrenaline-induced arrhythmia. None of the compounds showed activity in calcium chloride- or barium chloride-induced arrhythmias. HBK-16, HBK-17, HBK-18, and HBK-19 decreased heart rhythm at ED84. All compounds significantly lowered blood pressure in normotensive rats. HBK-18 showed the strongest hypotensive properties (the lowest active dose: 0.01 mg/kg). HBK-19 was the only compound in the group, which did not show hypotensive effect at antiarrhythmic doses. HBK-16, HBK-17, HBK-18, HBK-19 showed weak antioxidant properties. Our results indicate that the studied 2-methoxyphenylpiperazine derivatives that possessed stronger alpha(1A)-adrenolytic properties (i.e., HBK-16, HBK-17, HBK-18, and HBK-19) were the most active compounds in adrenaline-induced arrhythmia. Thus, we suggest that the potent blockade of alpha(1A)-receptor subtype is essential to attenuate adrenaline-induced arrhythmia.

The purpose of this study was to measure its whole-body biokinetics and estimate its radiation dosimetry in healthy human volunteers. The study was conducted within a regulatory framework that required its pharmacologic safety to be assessed simultaneously. Methods: The sample included 7 subjects ranging in age from 22 to 54 y old. An average of 12.7 wholebody scans were acquired sequentially on a dual-head camera for up to 50 h after the intravenous administration of 185 MBq (5 MCi) (123)1-ADAM. The fraction of the administered dose in 13 regions of interest (ROIs) was quantified from the attenuation-corrected geometric mean counts in conjugate views. Multiexponential functions were iteratively fit to each time-activity curve using a nonlinear, least-squares regression algorithm. These curves were numerically integrated to yield source organ residence times. Gender-specific radiation doses were then estimated with the MIRD technique. SPECT brain scans obtained 3 h after injection were evaluated using an ROI analysis to determine the range of values for the region to cerebellum. Results: There were no pharmacologic effects of the radiotracer on any of the subjects, including no change in heart rate, blood pressure, or laboratory results. Early planar images showed differentially increased activity in the lungs. SPECT images demonstrated that the radiopharmaceutical localized in the midbrain in a distribution that is consistent with selective transporter binding. The dose-limiting organ in both men and women was the distal colon, which received an average of 0.12 mGy/MBq (0.43 rad/mCi) (range, 0.098-0.15 mGy/MBq). The effective dose equivalent and effective dose for 1231-ADAM were 0.037 +/- 0.003 mSv/MBq and 0.036 +/- 0.003 mSv/MBq, respectively. The mean adult male value of effective dose for 1231-ADAM is similar in magnitude to that of In-111-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (0.035 mGy/MBq), half that of In-111-pentetreotide (0.81 mGy/MBq), and approximately twice that of (123)1-inosine 5'-monophosphate (0.018 mGy/MBq). The differences in results between this study and a previous publication are most likely due to several factors, the most prominent being this dataset used attenuation correction of the scintigraphic data. Region-to-cerebellum ratios for the brain SPECT scans were 1.95 +/- 0.13 for the midbrain, 1.27 +/- 0.10 for the medial temporal regions, and 1.11 +/- 0.07 for the striatum. Conclusion: (123)1-ADAM may be a safe and effective radiotracer for imaging serotonin transporters in the brain and the body.

Uptake of [(111)ln-DTPA-D-Phe(1)]octreotide is dependent on sst-mediated internalization of the radioligand by the tumor cells. Human sst-positive tumors frequently express multiple sst subtypes. In vitro studies have demonstrated that the 5 sst subtypes (sst(1-5)) differentially internalize sst-bound ligand. The present study was performed to evaluate the role Of sst(2) in vivo in determining the uptake of [(111)ln-DTPA-D-Phe(1)]octreotide, as well as of the more "universal" ligand [(111)ln-DTIPA]SS-14, by sst-positive organs expressing multiple sst subtypes. Methods: Wild-type and sst(2) knockout mice (n = 4 per treatment group) were injected intravenously with 1 MBq (0.1 mug) [(111)ln-DTPA-D-Phe(1)]octreotide or [(111)ln-DTPA]SS-14. After 24 h, the animals were sacrificed and radioactivity in the organs under investigation was determined. In addition, the sst subtype messenger RNA (mRNA) expression pattern in these organs was determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) analysis. Results: RT-PCR analysis demonstrated the presence of all 5 sst subtype mRNAs in the adrenals and pituitary of wild-type mice but no sst(2) in the knockout mice. The thymus expressed mRNA for sst(2) and sst(4) mRNA in wild-type mice, whereas no sst(2) was detected in knockout mice. In wildtype mice, the in vivo uptake values (in percentage injected dose per gram of tissue) of [(111)ln-DTPA-D-Phe(1)]octreotide for the pituitary, adrenals, pancreas, and thymus amounted to 1.2 +/- 0.2, 0.26 +/- 0.03, 0.18 +/- 0.03, and 0.30 +/- 0.05, respectively, in wild-type mice. Compared with wild-type mice, sst(2) knockout mice had dramatically lower uptake values in these organs-lower by 97%, 83%, 96%, and 94%, respectively (P < 0.01 vs. wild type). Comparable differences in the uptake of radioactivity between wild-type and knockout mice were found using [(111)ln-DTPA]SS-14 as the radiotracer. Interestingly, in some organs expressing sst(2) mRNA (liver, muscle, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells), no specific binding of [(111)ln-DTPA-D-Phe(1)]octreotide or [(111)ln-DTPA]SS-14 to sst in vivo was found, suggesting that the sst(2) protein expression level was very low in these tissues. Conclusion: The uptake of [(111)ln-DTPA-D-Phe(1)]octreotide and [(111)ln-DTPA]SS-14 in sst-positive organs is determined predominantly by sst(2).

The tetramethylrhodamyl (Rhm) group was attached to the precursor peptide of 9 to give [HO1] [Orn(8)(5/6C-Rhm)]VT (11). All 11 fluorescent peptides were evaluated in human OT and vasopressin V-1a (vasoconstrictor), V-1b (pituitary), and V-2 (antidiuretic) receptor binding and functional assays. With K-d = 6.24, 217, > 10000, and > 10000 nM for the OT, V-1a, V-1b, and V-2 receptors, peptide 1 is a potent and selective fluorescent OT antagonist and may be useful for specifically labeling OT receptors while peptide 2 exhibits low affinities for all the receptors. The fluorescent peptides 3-10 are all very potent agonists for the human OT receptor. They exhibit the following Kd values (nM) for the human OT, V-1a, V-1b, and V-2 receptors, respectively: (3) 0.29, 57, 124, > 10000; (4) 1.8, 25.5, 150, > 10000; (5) 0.34, 13.7, 66, nd (not determined); (6) 0.32, 17.3, 53, > 10000; (7) 0.25, 107, 393, > 10000; (8) 0.40, 30, 282, > 10000; (9) 0.18, 12.2, 126, nd; (10) 0.17, 11.8, 87, > 1000; (11) 0.092, 7.36, nd, nd. Peptide 7 exhibits both a high affinity and a high selectivity for human OT receptors. Peptides 7 and 11 were utilized to study the internalization of the OT receptor-ligand complex. Preliminary studies indicate that this process is similar to that observed for the vasopressin V-1a receptor and differs from that observed for vasopressin V-2 receptors. Some or all of the fluorescent OT antagonists and agonists reported here are very promising new fluorescent ligands for labeling cells which express the human OT receptor and are also useful tools to follow endocytosis of the receptor-ligand complex.

Highly sensitive A beta positron emission tomography (PET) imaging plays an essential role in diagnosing and evaluating the therapeutic effects of AD. Aim To synthesize a new A beta tracer [F-18]DRKXH1 (5-(4-(6-(2-[18]fluoroethoxy)ethoxy)imidazo[1,2-alpha]pyridin-2-yl)phenyl) and evaluate the tracer performance by biodistribution analysis, in vivo small-animal PET-CT dynamic scan, ex vivo and in vitro autoradiography, and PET in human subjects. Methods [F-18]DRKXH1 was synthesized automatically by the GE FN module. Log D (pH 7.4) and biodistribution of [F-18]DRKXH1 were investigated. Small-animal-PET was used for [F-18]DRKXH1 and [F-18]AV45 imaging study in AD transgenic mice (APPswe/PSEN1dE9) and age-matched normal mice. The distribution volume ratios (DVR) and standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were calculated with the cerebellum as the reference region. The deposition of A beta plaques in the brain of AD transgenic mice was determined by ex vivo autoradiography and immunohistochemistry. In vitro autoradiography was performed in the postmortem brain sections of AD patients and healthy controls. Two healthy control subjects and one AD patient was subjected to in vivo PET study using [F-18]DRKXH1. Results The yield of [F-18]DRKXH1 was 40%, and the specific activity was 156.64 +/- 11.55 GBq/mu mol. [F-18]DRKXH1 was mainly excreted through the liver and kidney. The small-animal PET study showed high initial brain uptake and rapid washout of [F-18]DRKXH1. The concentration of [F-18]DRKXH1 was detected in the cortex and hippocampus of AD transgenic mice brain. The cortex DVR of AD transgenic mice was higher than that of WT mice (P < 0.0001). Moreover, the SUVRs of AD transgenic mice were higher than those of WT mice based on the 0-60-min dynamic scanning. In vitro autoradiography showed a significant concentration of tracer in the A beta plaque-rich areas in the brain of AD transgenic mice. The DVR value of [F-18]-DRKXH1 is higher than that of [F-18]-AV45 (1.29 +/- 0.05 vs. 1.05 +/- 0.08; t = 5.33, P = 0.0003). Autoradiography of postmortem human brain sections showed [F-18]DRKXH1-labeled A beta plaques in the AD brain. The AD patients had high retention in cortical regions, while healthy control subjects had uniformly low radioactivity uptake. Conclusions [F-18]DRKXH1 is an A beta tracer with high sensitivity in preclinical study and has the potential for in vivo detection of the human brain.

The objectives of this study were (1) to develop an efficient one-step method for the preparation of 2-[F-18]fluoroethanol (2-[F-18]FEtOH) and 3-[F-18]fluoropropanol (3-[F-18]FPrOH); (2) to demonstrate the feasibility of using 2-[F-18]FEtOH as a nucleophile for the synthesis of 2-[F-18]fluoroethyl aryl esters and ethers; and (3) to determine the biodistribution profiles of 2-[F-18]FEtOH and 3-[F-18]FPrOH in mice. Methods: 2-[F-18]FEtOH and 3-[F-18]FPrOH were prepared by reacting n-Bu4N[F-18]F with ethylene carbonate and 1,3-dioxan-2-one, respectively, in diethylene glycol at 165 degrees C and purified by distillation. 2-[F-18]fluoroethyl 4-fluorobenzoate and 1-(2-[F-18]fluoroethoxy)-4-nitrobenzene were prepared by coupling 2-[F-18]FEtOH with 4-fluorobenzoyl chloride and 1-fluoro-4-nitrobenzene, respectively. Biodistribution and PET/CT imaging studies of 2-[F-18]FEtOH and 3-[F-18]FPrOH were performed in normal female Balb/C mice. Results: The preparation of 2-[F-18]FEtOH and 3-[F-18]FPrOH took 60 mm, and their decay-corrected yields were 88.6 +/- 2.0% (n = 9) and 65.6 +/- 10.2% (n = 5), respectively. The decay-corrected yields for the preparation of 2-[F-18]fluoroethyl 4-fluorobenzoate and 1-(2-[F-18]fluoroethoxy)-4-nitrobenzene were 36.1 +/- 5.4% (n = 3) and 27.7 +/- 10.7% (n = 3), respectively. Imaging/biodistribution studies in mice using 2-[F-18]FEtOH showed high initial radioactivity accumulation in all major organs followed by very slow clearance. On the contrary, by using 3-[F-18]FPrOH, radioactivity accumulated in all major organs was cleared rapidly, but massive in vivo defluorination (31.3 +/- 9.57%ID/g in bone at 1 h post-injection) was observed. Conclusions: Using 2-[F-18]FEtOH/3-[F-18]FPrOH as a nucleophile is a competitive new strategy for the synthesis of 2-[F-18]fluoroethyl/3-[F-18]fluoropropyl aryl esters and ethers. Our biodistribution data emphasize the importance of in vivo stability of PET tracers containing a 2-[F-18]fluoroethyl or 3-[F-18]fluoropropyl group due to high background and high bone uptake resulting from 2-[F-18]FEtOH and 3-[F-18]FPrOH, respectively. This is especially important for their aryl ester derivatives which are prone to in vivo hydrolysis. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

[<SUP>18</SUP>F]Fallypride dopamine D2 receptor studies using delayed microPET scans and a modified Logan plot	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						F-18-Fallypride; Dopamine receptors; Graphical analysis; Kinetic modeling; MicroPET	SCATTER CORRECTION; RAT-BRAIN; PET; BINDING; RADIOLIGAND; TRANSPORTER; ISOFLURANE; TRACER	[F-18]Fallypride PET studies can be used to estimate the nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) in vivo of dopamine D2/D3 receptor-rich regions of the brain. These Studies often take considerable time, up to >= 2 h, limiting the throughput. in this work, we investigated whether limited-duration scans performed Subsequent to tracer administration yielded stable BPND estimates. In particular, we applied a modified version of file Logan plot method oil the last 60 min of 120-min data and compared the results to those from analysis of the full data set. Methods: Fourteen male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with [F-18]fallypride intravenously while under isoflurane anesthesia, and dynamic data were acquired on the microPET Focus 220 scanner for 120 min. The distribution Volume ratio (DVR=BPND+1) was calculated from a Logan plot using 120 min of data and from a modified version using only the last 60 min. Three of these rats were imaged again oil a second day to test the reproducibility. A two-tissue compartment model also was used to fit the time-activity Curves (TACs) of the 120-min scans to estimate the parameters K-1, k(2), k(on), k(4) and B-max. These parameters were then used to simulate similar TACs while changing k(on) to reflect changes in the dopaminergic system. The simulated TACs were used as a means for exploring the differences in DVR estimates between the last 60 min only and the full 120 min of simulated data. Results: The average DVR from the full 120-min scans was 13.8 +/- 0.9, whereas file average DVR estimated from only the last 60 min of data (DVR') was 16.3 +/- 1.0. The DVR estimates showed good reproducibility in the three rats (mean DVR=13.8 +/- 1.5 on Day 1 and DVR=13.8 +/- 0.9 on Day 2). The simulations showed that the relationship between DVR' and DVR estimates follows it semilinear form with varying k(on). Conclusion: Although the BPND estimates are slightly overestimated in a delayed scan mode (i.e., no initial radiotracer uptake measurements) compared to a full scan, this overestimation depends primarily on k(3) (approximate to k(on) x B-max) and has been evaluated in this work for a wide range of k(on) values using simulated TACs. In particular, the sensitivity of DVR' to changes in k(on) is similar to that of DVR. This method of delayed scans eliminates the necessity of imaging during the initial uptake of the radiotracer and, thus, can be used to increase the throughput Of Studies. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Nuclear Medicine procedures currently involve radiolabeled SP derivatives in peptide radioligand endotherapy of inoperable glioblastoma. Promising clinical results sparked the demand for facile production strategies for a functionalized 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid-[Thi(8), Met(O-2)(11)]-SP to allow for rapid Gallium-68 or Bismuth-213 complexation. Therefore, we provide a simple kit-like radiotracer preparation method that caters for the gallium-68 activity eluted from a SnO2 generator matrix as well as preliminary results on the adaptability to produce [Bi-213]Bi-DOTA-[Thi(8), Met(O-2)(11)]SP from the same vials containing the same starting material. Following a phase of radioanalysis for complexation of gallium-68 to DOTA-[Thi(8), Met(O-2)(11)]SP and assessing the radiolabeling parameters, the vials containing appropriate kit-prototype material were produced in freeze-dried batches. The facile radiolabeling performance was tested and parameters for future human application were calculated to meet the criteria for theranostic loco-regional co-administration of activity doses comprising [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA-[Thi(8), Met(O-2)(11)]SP mixed with [Bi-213]Bi-DOTA-[Thi(8), Met(O-2)(11)]SP. [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA-[Thi(8), Met(O-2)(11)]SP was prepared quantitatively from lyophilized starting material within 25 min providing the required molar activity (18 +/- 4 GBq/mu mol) and activity concentration (98 +/- 24 MBq/mL), radiochemical purity (>95%) and sustained radiolabeling performance (4 months at >95% LE) as well as acceptable product quality (>95% for 120 min). Additionally, vials of the same starting materials were successfully adapted to a labeling strategy available for preparation of [Bi-213]Bi-DOTA-[Thi(8), Met(O-2)(11)]SP providing sufficient activity for 1-2 human doses. The resultant formulation of [Ga-68]Ga-/[Bi-213]Bi-DOTA-[Thi(8), Met(O-2)(11)]SP activity doses was considered of adequate radiochemical quality for administration. This investigation proposes a simple kit-like formulation of DOTA-[Thi(8), Met(O-2)(11)]SP-a first-line investigation into a user friendly, straightforward tracer preparation that would warrant efficient clinical investigations in the future. Quantitative radiolabeling was accomplished for [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA-[Thi(8), Met(O-2)(11)]SP and [Bi-213]Bi-DOTA-[Thi(8), Met(O-2)(11)]SP preparations; a key requirement when addressing the specific route of catheter-assisted co-injection directly into the intratumoral cavities.

Ibudilast attenuates CNS microglial activation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Fujimoto et al., 1999; Cho et al., 2010). In vitro evidence suggests that ibudilast is neuroprotective by suppressing neuronal cell death induced by microglial activation. People with ALS have increased microglial activation measured by [11C]PBR28-PET in the motor cortices. The primary objective is to determine the impact of ibudilast on reducing glial activation and neuroaxonal loss in ALS, measured by PBR28PET and serum Neurofilament light (NfL). The secondary objectives included determining safety and tolerability of ibudilast high dosage (up to 100 mg/day) over 36 weeks. In this open label trial, 35 eligible ALS participants underwent ibudilast treatment up to 100 mg/day for 36 weeks. Of these, 30 participants were enrolled in the main study cohort and were included in biomarker, safety and tolerability analyses. Five additional participants were enrolled in the expanded access arm, who did not meet imaging eligibility criteria and were included in the safety and tolerability analyses. The primary endpoints were median change from baseline in (a) PBR28-PET uptake in primary motor cortices, measured by standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) over 12-24 weeks and (b) serum NfL over 36-40 weeks. The secondary safety and tolerability endpoints were collected through Week 40. The baseline median (range) of PBR28-PET SUVR was 1.033 (0.847, 1.170) and NfL was 60.3 (33.1, 219.3) pg/ml. Participants who completed both pre and post-treatment scans had PBR28-PET SUVR median(range) change from baseline of 0.002 (-0.184, 0.156) , P = 0.5 (n = 22). The median(range) NfL change from baseline was 0.4 pg/ml (-1.8, 17.5), P = 0.2 (n = 10 participants). 30(86%) participants experienced at least one, possibly study drug related adverse event. 13(37%) participants could not tolerate 100 mg/day and underwent dose reduction to 60-80 mg/day and 11(31%) participants discontinued study drug early due to drug related adverse events. The study concludes that following treatment with ibudilast up to 100 mg/day in ALS participants, there were no significant reductions in (a) motor cortical glial activation measured by PBR28-PET SUVR over 12-24 weeks or (b) CNS neuroaxonal loss, measured by serum NfL over 36-40 weeks. Dose reductions and discontinuations due to treatment emergent adverse events were common at this dosage in ALS participants.

Pathological changes in norepinephrine and norepinephrine transporter (NET) function and degeneration of the locus coeruleus produce irreversible impairments within the whole norepinephrine system, disrupting cognitive processes. Monitoring these changes could enhance diagnostic accuracy and support development of novel therapeutic components for several neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, we aimed to develop a straightforward nucleophilic fluorination method with high molar activity for the novel NET radiotracer [F-18]NS12137 and to demonstrate the ability of [F-18]NS12137 to quantify changes in NET expression. Methods: We applied an F-18-radiolabeling method in which a brominated precursor was debrominated by nucleophilic F-18-fluorination in dimethyl sulfoxide. Radiolabeling was followed by a deprotection step, purification, and formulation of the radiotracer. The [F-18]NS12137 brain uptake and distribution were studied with in vivo PET/CT and ex vivo autoradiography using both adult and immature Sprague-Dawley rats because postnatal NET expression peaks at 10-20 days post birth. The NET specificity for the tracer was demonstrated by pretreatment of the animals with nisoxetine, which is well-known to have a high affinity for NET. Results: [F-18]NS12137 was successfully synthesized with radiochemical yields of 18.6 +/- 5.6%, radiochemical purity of >99%, and molar activity of >500 GBq/pmol at the end of synthesis. The in vivo [F-18]NS12137 uptake showed peak standard uptake values (SUV) of over 1.5 (adult) and 2.2 (immature) in the different brain regions. Peak SUV/30 min and peak SUV/60 min ratios were calculated for the different brain regions of the adult and immature rats, with a peak SUV/60 min ratio of more than 4.5 in the striatum of adult rats. As expected, in vivo studies demonstrated uptake of the tracer in brain areas rich in NET, particularly thalamus, neocortex, and striatum, and remarkably also in the locus coeruleus, a quite small volume for imaging with PET. The uptake was significantly higher in immature rats compared to the adult animals. Ex vivo studies using autoradiography showed very strong specific binding in NET-rich areas such as the locus coeruleus and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and high binding in larger grey matter areas such as the neocortex and striatum. The uptake of [F-18]NS12137 was dramatically reduced both in vivo and ex vivo by pretreatment with nisoxetine, demonstrating the specificity of binding. Conclusions: [F-18]NS12137 was synthesized in good yield and high molar activity and demonstrated the characteristics of a good radiotracer, such as good brain penetration, fast washout, and high specific binding to NET.

All antagonists indicated a one-site fit. 4 The affinity estimates (pk;) of tetra-amines calculated in binding assays using native receptors were similar to those obtained using cloned receptors. Among these compounds some displayed selectivity between muscarinic receptor subtypes, indicating that they may be valuable tools in receptor characterization. Spirotramine was selective for Mi receptors versus all other subtypes (pK(i) native: M-1, 7.32+/-0.10; M-2, 6.50+/-0.11; M-3, 6.02+/-0.13; M-4, 6.28+/-0.16; pK(i) cloned: M-1, 7.69+/-0.08; M-2, 6.22+/-0.14; M-3, 6.11+/-0.16; 6.35+/-0.11) whereas CC8 is highly selective for M-2 receptors versus the other subtypes (pK(i) native: M-1, 7.50+/-0.04; M-2, 9.01+/-0.12; M-3, 6.70+/-0.08; M-4, 7.56+/-0.04; pK(i) cloned: M-1, 7.90+/-0.20; M-2, 9.04+/-0.08; M-3, 6.40+/-0.07; M-4, 7.40+/-0.04). Furthermore, particularly relevant for this investigation were tetra-amines dipitramine and AM172 for their ability to significantly differentiate MI and Mg receptors. 5 The apparent affinity values (pA(2)) Obtained for tetra-amines in functional studies using the prostatic portion of rabbit vas deferens correlated most closely with the values (pK(i)) obtained at either native or human recombinant muscarinic M-4 receptors. This supports the view that the muscarinic receptor mediating inhibition of neurogenic contractions of rabbit vas deferens may not belong to the M-1 type but rather appears to be of the M-4 subtype.

Methods and subjects: PET measurements were made in healthy volunteers, aged between 25 and 78 years, and AD patients, aged between 67 and 82 years. using [C-11]vinpocetine as the tracer. Global and regional quantitative parameters of tracer uptake and binding, including time activity curves (TAC) of standard uptake values (%SUV), binding affinity parameters, intensity spectrum and homogeneity of the uptake distribution were measured and analysed. Results: Both %SUV and binding values increased with age linearly in the whole brain and in all brain regions. There were no significant differences between the %SUV values of the AD patients and age matched control subjects. There were, however, significant differences in %SUV values in a large number of brain regions between young subjects and old subjects, as well as young subjects and AD patients. The intensity spectrum analysis and homogeneity analysis of the voxel data show that the homogeneity of the %SUV values decreases with ageing and during the disease, whereas the centre of the intensity spectrum is shifted to higher %SUV values. These data indicate an inhomogeneous up-regulation of the TSPO system during ageing and AD. These changes were significant between the group of young subjects and old subjects, as well as young subjects and AD patients, but not between old subjects and AD patients. Conclusions: The present data indicate that [C-11]vinpocetine may serve as a molecular imaging biomarker of the activity of the TSPO system and, consequently, of the up-regulation of microglia during ageing and in neuroinflammatory diseases. However, the global and regional brain %SUV values between AD patients and age matched controls are not different from each other. The disease specific changes, measured with [C-11] vinpocetine in AD are significantly different from those measured in age matched controls only if the inhomogeneities in the uptake pattern are explored with advanced mathematical techniques. For this reason. PET studies using [C-11]vinpocetine, as molecular imaging biomarker, can efficiently visualise the activation of microglia and the up-regulation of TSPO during ageing and in diseased brains with the help of an appropriate inhomogeneity analysis of the radioligand's brain uptake pattern.

Patients with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer after >= 1 novel androgen-axis drug, either chemotherapy naive or postchemotherapy, with sufficient bone marrow reserve, normal kidney function, sufficient PSMA expression by PSMA PET, and no PSMA-negative soft-tissue lesions were eligible. Patients were randomized (1:1) into 2 activity groups (6.0 or 7.4 GBq per cycle) and received up to 4 cycles every 8 wk. The primary safety endpoint was assessed by collecting and grading adverse events using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Patients were followed until disease progression, death, serious or intolerable adverse events, study termination by sponsor, patient withdrawal, lost to follow-up, or 24 mo after the first cycle. Results: The study was closed at enrollment of 71 of 200 planned patients because of sponsorship transfer. A total of 64 (90.1%) patients received at least 1 cycle of Lu-177-PSMA-617: 28 (36%) in arm 1 (6.0 GBq) and 41 (64%) in arm 2 (7.4 GBq). There were 10 (43.5%), 19 (46.5%), and 29 (45.3%) patients who completed 4 cycles of Lu-177-PSMA-617 in the 6.0-GBq arm, 7.4-GBq arm, and overall, respectively. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of any grade in the 6.0-GBq arm, the 7.4-GBq arm and overall, were dry mouth (47.8%; 63.4%; 57.8%, respectively), fatigue (56.5%; 51.2%; 53.1%, respectively), nausea (52.2%; 43.9%; 46.9%, respectively), and diarrhea (13.0%; 31.7%; 25.0%, respectively). Frequencies of all other TEAEs were comparable among the 2 groups (within 10% difference). Serious possibly drug-related TEAEs were reported for 5 (7.8%) patients overall (none were considered as probably or definitely related to treatment): 1 subdural hematoma grade 4, 1 anemia grade 3, 1 thrombocytopenia grade 4, 1 gastrointestinal hemorrhage grade 3, and 1 acute kidney injury grade 3. There were no clinically significant changes in vital signs in electrocardiograms in the 2 treatment groups. No trend to creatinine increase or increasing frequency of shifts from normal to abnormal over time for any hematologic parameter was noted. Conclusion: Lu-177-PSMA-617 was safe and well-tolerated at 6.0 and 7.4 GBq per cycle given at 8-wk intervals with side effects easily managed with standard medical support. With established safety, further clinical trials applying individualized dosimetry and testing different Lu-177-PSMA-617 administration schemes (activity levels, time intervals) are needed to optimize tumor dose delivery and treatment efficacy.

Molecular imaging with PET is also increasingly used in drug development, especially for the determination of drug receptor interaction for CNS-active drugs. This gives the opportunity to relate clinical efficacy to per cent receptor occupancy of a drug on a certain targeted receptor and to relate drug pharmacokinetics in plasma to interaction with target protein. In the present review we will focus on the study of transporters, such as the monoamine transporters, the P-glycoprotein (Pgp) transporter, the vesicular monoamine transporter type 2, and the glucose transporter using PET radioligands. Neurotransmitter transporters are presynaptically located and in vivo imaging using PET can therefore be used for the determination of the density of afferent neurons. Several promising PET ligands for the noradrenaline transporter (NET) have been labeled and evaluated in vivo including in man, but a really useful PET ligand for NET still remains to be identified. The most promising tracer to date is (S,S)-[F-18]FMeNER-D-2. The in vivo visualization of the dopamine transporter (DAT) may give clues in the evaluation of conditions related to dopamine, such as Parkinson's disease and drug abuse. The first PET radioligands based on cocaine were not selective, but more recently several selective tracers such as [C-11]PE2I have been characterized and shown to be suitable as PET radioligands. Although there are a large number of serotonin transporter inhibitors used today as SSRIs, it was not until very recently, when [C-11]McN5652 was synthesized, that this transporter was studied using PET. New candidates as PET radioligands for the SERT have subsequently been developed and [C-11]DASB and [C-11]MADAM and their analogues are today the most promising ligands. The existing radioligands for Pgp transporters seem to be suitable tools for the study of both peripheral and central drug-Pgp interactions, although [C-11]verapamil and [F-18]fluoropaclitaxel are probably restricted to use in studies of the blood-brain barrier. The vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) is another interesting target for diagnostic imaging and [C-11]DTBZ is a promising tracer. The noninvasive imaging of transporter density as a function of disease progression or availability following interaction with blocking drugs is highlighted, including the impact on both development of new therapies and the process of developing new drugs. Although CNS-related work focusing on psychiatric disorders is the main focus of this review, other applications of PET ligands, such as diagnosis of cancer, diabetes research, and drug interactions with efflux systems, are also discussed. The use of PET especially in terms of tracer development is briefly described. Finally, it can be concluded that there is an urgent need for new, selective radioligands for the study of the transporter systems in the human brain using PET.

A number of second messenger (cyclic AMP, Ins(1,4,5)P-3) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK and JNK) responses stimulated by the mACh receptor agonist methacholine were examined in CHO-m2m3 cells and compared to those stimulated in CHO-m2 and CHO-m3 cell-lines, expressing comparable levels Of M2 or M3 mACh receptors. 2 Based on comparisons between cell-lines and pertussis toxin (PTx) pretreatment to eliminate receptor-G(i/o) coupling, evidence was obtained for (i) an M-2 mACh receptor-mediated contribution to the predominantly M-3 mACh receptor-mediated Ins(1,4,5)P-3 response and (ii) a facilitation of the inhibitory effect Of M-2 mACh receptor on forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation by M-3 mACh receptor coactivation at low agonist concentrations (MCh 10(-9)-10(-6) m). 3 The most profound cross-talk effects were observed with respect to ERK activation. Thus, while MCh stimulated ERK activation in both CHO-m2 and CHO-m3 cells (pEC(50) values: 5.64+/-0.09 and 5.57+/-0.16, respectively), the concentration - effect relation was approx 50-fold left-shifted in CHO-m2m3 cells (pEC(50): 7.17+/-0.07). In addition, the ERK response was greater and more sustained in CHO-m2m3 cells. In contrast, only minor differences were seen in the time-courses and concentration-dependencies of JNK activation in CHO-m3 and CHO-m2m3 cells. 4 Costimulation of endogenous P2Y(2) purinoceptors also caused an approx 10-fold left-shift in the MCh-stimulated ERK response in CHO-m2 cells, suggesting that the G(q/11)/G(i/o) interaction to affect ERK activation is not specific to muscarinic receptors. 5 PTx pretreatment of cells had unexpected effects on ERK activation by MCh in both CHO-m2m3 and CHO-m3 cells. Thus, in CHO-m3 cells PTx pretreatment caused a marked left-shift in the MCh concentration-effect curve, while in PTx-treated CHO-m2m3 cells the maximal responsiveness was decreased, but the potency of MCh was only slightly affected. 6 The data presented here strongly suggest that cross-talk between M-2 and M-3 mACh receptors occurs at the level of both second messenger and ERK regulation. Further, these data provide novel insights into the involvement of G(i/o) proteins in both positive and negative modulation of ERK responses evoked by G protein-coupled receptors.

The type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CM is widely expressed in the human central nervous system. The objective of this study was to quantify the test-retest reproducibility of measures of the PET ligand [C-11]MePPEP in order to assess the stability of CB1-receptor quantification in humans in vivo. Methods: Fifteen healthy subjects (eight females; median age 32 years, range 25 to 65 years) had a 90-minute PET scan on two occasions after injection of a median dose of [C-11]MePPEP of 364 MBq. Metabolite-corrected arterial plasma input functions were obtained for all scans. Eight ROIs, reflecting different levels of receptor densities/concentrations, were defined automatically: hippocampus, anterior cingulate gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, nucleus accumbens, thalamus, and pons. We used seven quantification methods: reversible compartmental models with one and two tissue classes, two and four rate constants, and a variable blood volume term (2kbv; 4kbv); model-free (spectral) analyses with and without regularisation, including one with voxel-wise quantification; the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) with pons as a pseudo-reference region; and modified standard uptake values (mSUVs) calculated for the period of similar to 30-60 mm after injection. Percentage test retest change and between-subject variability were both assessed, and test retest reliability was quantified by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The ratio of binding estimates pallidum: pons served as an indicator of a method's ability to reflect binding heterogeneity. Results: Neither the SRTM nor the 4kbv model produced reliable measures, with ICCs around zero. Very good (>0.75) or excellent (>0.80) ICCs were obtained with the other methods. The most reliable were spectral analysis parametric maps (average across regions +/- standard deviation 0.83 +/- 0.03), rank shaping regularised spectral analysis (0.82 +/- 0.05), and the 2kbv model (0.82 +/- 0.09), but mSUVs were also reliable for most regions (0.79 +/- 0.13). Mean test retest changes among the five well-performing methods ranged from 12 +/- 10% for mSUVs to 16% for 2kby. Intersubject variability was high, with mean between-subject coefficients of variation ranging from 32 +/- 13% for mSUVs to 45% for 2kbv. The highest pallidum:pons ratios of binding estimates were achieved by mSUV (4.2), spectral analysis-derived parametric maps (3.6), and 2kbv (3.6). Conclusion: Quantification of CBI receptor availability using [C-11]MePPEP shows good to excellent reproducibility with several kinetic models and model-free analyses, whether applied on a region-of-interest or voxelwise basis. Simple mSUV measures were also reliable for most regions, but do not allow fully quantitative interpretation. [C-11] MePPEP PET is well placed as a tool to investigate CB1-receptor mediated neurotransmission in health and disease. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.	[Barros, Daniela A.

Trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells remain sensitive to the auger electron-emitting radiotherapeutic agent <SUP>111</SUP>In-NLS-trastuzumab and are radiosensitized by methotrexate	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						breast cancer; trastuzumab (Herceptin); radiosensitization; methotrexate; Auger electrons	TARGETED RADIONUCLIDE THERAPY; GROWTH-FACTOR RECEPTOR; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY; HERCEPTIN; OVEREXPRESSION; CHEMOTHERAPY; HER-2/NEU; MECHANISM; EFFICACY; SAFETY	Our goals in this study were to determine whether 111 In-trastuzumab coupled to peptides harboring nuclear localizing sequences (NLSs) could kill trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cell lines through the emission of Auger electrons and whether the combination of radiosensitization with methotrexate (MTX) would augment the cytotoxicity of this radiopharmaceutical. Methods: Trastuzumab was derivatized with sulfosuccinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-l-carboxylate for reaction with NLS peptides and then conjugated with diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid for labeling with In-111. HER2 expression was determined by Western blot and by radioligand binding assay using In-111-trastuzumab in a panel of breast cancer cell lines, including SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-231 and its HER2-transfected subclone (231-H2N), and 2 trastuzumab-resistant variants (TrR1 and TrR2). Nuclear importation of In-111-NLS-trastuzumab and In-111-trastuzumab in breast cancer cells was measured by subcellular fractionation, and the clonogenic survival of these cells was determined after incubation with In-111-NLS-trastuzumab, (111)Intrastuzumab, or trastuzumab (combined with or without MTX). Survival curves were analyzed according to the dose-response model, and the radiation-enhancement ratio was calculated from the survival curve parameters. Results: The expression of HER2 was highest in SK-BR-3 cells (12.6 x 10(5) receptors/cell), compared with 231-H2N and TrR1 cells (6.1 X 10(5) and 5.1 x 101 receptors/cell, respectively), and lowest in MDA-MB-231 and TrR2 cells (0.4 x 10(5) and 0.6 x 10(5) receptors/cell, respectively). NLS peptides increased the nuclear uptake of In-111-trastuzumab in MDA-MB-231, 231-H2N, TrR1, and TrR2 cells from 0.1% +/- 0.01%, 2.5% +/- 0.2%, 2.8% +/- 0.7%, and 0.5% +/- 0.1% to 0.5% +/- 0.1 %, 4.6% +/- 0.1 %, 5.2% +/- 0.6%, and 1.5% +/- 0.2%, respectively. The cytotoxicity of In-111-NLS-trastuzumab on breast cancer cells was directly correlated with the HER2 expression densities of the cells. On a molar concentration basis, the effective concentration required to kill 50% of 231-H2N and TrR1 cells for In-111-NLS-trastuzumab was 9- to 12-fold lower than for (111)Intrastuzumab and 16- to 77-fold lower than for trastuzumab. MDA-MB-231 and TrR2 cells were less sensitive to In-111-NLS-trastuzumab or In-111-trastuzumab, and both cell lines were completely insensitive to trastuzumab. The radiation-enhancement ratio induced by MTX for 231-H2N and TrR1 cells after exposure to In-111-NLS-trastuzumab was 1.42 and 1.68, respectively. Conclusion: Targeted Auger electron radioimmunotherapy with In-111-NLS-trastuzumab can overcome resistance to trastuzumab, and MTX can potently enhance the sensitivity of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells to the lethal Auger electrons emitted by this radiopharmaceutical.

Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Heterogeneity and DNA Repair Defects in Prostate Cancer	EUROPEAN UROLOGY			English	Article						Prostate-specific membrane antigen; Prostate cancer; Castration-resistant prostate cancer; Defective DNA repair; Theranostics; Tumour heterogeneity; BRCA2; Treatment resistance	RADIOLIGAND THERAPY; EXPRESSION; VALIDATION; RECURRENCE; GENE; PSMA	Background: Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA; folate hydrolase) prostate cancer (PC) expression has theranostic utility. Objective: To elucidate PC PSMA expression and associate this with defective DNA damage repair (DDR). Design, setting, and participants: Membranous PSMA (mPSMA) expression was scored immunohistochemically from metastatic castration-resistant PC (mCRPC) and matching, same-patient, diagnostic biopsies, and correlated with next-generation sequencing (NGS) and clinical outcome data. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Expression of mPSMA was quantitated by modified H-score. Patient DNA was tested by NGS. Gene expression and activity scores were determined from mCRPC transcriptomes. Statistical correlations utilised Wilcoxon signed rank tests, survival was estimated by Kaplan-Meier test, and sample heterogeneity was quantified by Shannon's diversity index. Results and limitations: Expression of mPSMA at diagnosis was associated with higher Gleason grade (p = 0.04) and worse overall survival (p = 0.006). Overall, mPSMA expression levels increased at mCRPC (median H-score [interquartile range]: castrationsensitive prostate cancer [CSPC] 17.5 [0.0-60.0] vs mCRPC 55.0 [2.8-117.5]). Surprisingly, 42% (n = 16) of CSPC and 27% (n = 16) of mCRPC tissues sampled had no detectable mPSMA (H-score <10). Marked intratumour heterogeneity of mPSMA expression, with foci containing no detectable PSMA, was observed in all mPSMA expressing CSPC (100%) and 37 (84%) mCRPC biopsies. Heterogeneous intrapatient mPSMA expression between metastases was also observed, with the lowest expression in liver metastases. Tumours with DDR had higher mPSMA expression (p = 0.016; 87.5 [25.0-247.5] vs 20 [0.3-98.8]; difference in medians 60 [5.0-95.0]); validation cohort studies confirmed higher mPSMA expression in patients with deleterious aberrations in BRCA2 (p < 0.001; median H-score: 300 [165-300]; difference in medians 195.0 [100.0-270.0]) and ATM (p = 0.005; 212.5 [136.3-300]; difference in medians 140.0 [55.0-200]) than in molecularly unselected mCRPC biopsies (55.0 [2.75-117.5]). Validation studies using mCRPC transcriptomes corroborated these findings, also indicating that SOX2 high tumours have low PSMA expression. Conclusions: Membranous PSMA expression is upregulated in some but not all PCs, with mPSMA expression demonstrating marked inter- and intrapatient heterogeneity. DDR aberrations are associated with higher mPSMA expression and merit further evaluation as predictive biomarkers of response for PSMA-targeted therapies in larger, prospective cohorts. Patient summary: Through analysis of prostate cancer samples, we report that the presence of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is extremely variable both within one patient and between different patients. This may limit the usefulness of PSMA scans and PSMA-targeted therapies. We show for the first time that prostate cancers with defective DNA repair produce more PSMA and so may respond better to PSMA-targeting treatments. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

In vivo imaging studies of this receptor in humans have not been reported because of the lack of a selective ligand. We used a recently developed selective KOR agonist tracer, C-11-GR103545, and performed a study in rhesus monkeys to estimate the in vivo receptor concentration (B-max) and dissociation equilibrium constant (K-d). Methods: Four rhesus monkeys underwent 12 scans with C-11-GR103545 on a PET scanner under baseline and self-blocking conditions. The injected mass was 0.042 +/- 0.014 mu g/kg for the baseline scans and ranged from 0.16 to 0.3 mu g/kg for the self-blocking scans. The radiotracer was administered in a bolus-plus-infusion protocol, and cerebellum was used as the reference region in kinetic analysis. Binding potential (BPND) values were computed as [(C-ROI/C-REF) - 1], where C-ROI and C-REF are the mean of the radioactivity concentrations from 90 to 120 min after tracer administration in a given region of interest (ROI) and in the cerebellum. In 6 scans, arterial input functions and free fraction in plasma (f(p)) were measured. In addition, a 2-tissue-compartment model was used to compute the volume of distribution in the cerebellum (V-T_REF), which was then used to estimate the free-to-nondisplaceable concentration ratio (f(ND)) as f(p)/V-T_REF. A Scatchard plot was used to estimate B-max, and K-d(ND) = K-d/f(ND), the K-d value with respect to the cerebellar concentration. Individual data were first analyzed separately and then pooled together. When K-d(ND) was allowed to vary among ROIs, results were variable; therefore, K-d(ND) was constrained to be constant across ROIs, whereas B-max was allowed to be ROI-dependent and animal-dependent. Results: A global estimate of 1.72 nM was obtained for K-d(ND). Estimated Bmax ranged from 0.3 to 6.1 nM across ROIs and animals. The K-d estimate of 0.048 nM, obtained by correcting K-d(ND) by the factor f(ND), was in good agreement with the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.018 nM determined from functional assays in rabbit vas deferens and inhibition constant (K-i) of 0.02 nM measured in radioligand competition assays using cloned human receptors. On the basis of these data, a suitable tracer dose of 0.02 mu g/kg was selected for use in humans. Conclusion: The use of a bolus-plus-infusion protocol with the KOR agonist tracer C-11-GR103545 permitted the successful estimation of B-max and K-d(ND) in vivo. On the basis of the estimated K-d value, a tracer dose of 1.4 mu g (3.38 nmol) for an average body weight of 70 kg was chosen as the mass dose limit in human studies using this novel agonist radiotracer.

LY2510924 is a potent peptide antagonist of CXCR4. A derivative of LY2510924, BL01, was evaluated for theranostic applications targeting CXCR4. Methods: BL01 was synthesized by solid phase approach. A Lys(ivDde) residue was added at the C-terminus of LY2510924 (cyclo[Plie-TyrLys(iPr)-D-Arg-2-Nal-Gly-D-Glu]-Lys(iPr)-NH2). A DOTA chelator was conjugated to the side chain of the deprotected exogenous Lys residue. The binding affinity of Ga/Lu-BL01 was determined by competitive radioligand binding assays. BL01 was radiolabeled with (GaCl3)-Ga-68 or (LuCl3)-Lu-177. Biodistribution studies were performed in mice bearing Daudi Burkitt's lymphoma tumor xenografts at selected time points. PET imaging studies were performed with [Ga-68]Ga-BL01, with blocking experiments performed with preinjection of LY2510924. The stability of [Ga-68]Ga/[Lu-177]Lu-BL01 was assessed in mouse plasma. Results: Ga-BL01 and Lu-BL01 have nanomolar affinity for CXCR4. [Ga-68]Ga-BL01 was obtained in 58 +/- 5% decay-corrected radiochemical yields and >99% radiochemical purity with a molar activity of 40 +/- 11 GBq/mu mol, while [Lu-177]Lu-BL01 was obtained in 65 +/- 6% decay-corrected radiochemical yields and >99% radiochemical purity with a molar activity of 120 +/- 21 GBq/mu mol. [Ga-68]Ga-BL01 and [Lu-177]Lu-BL01 were excreted primarily through the renal pathway. Daudi xenografts were clearly delineated in PET images with good contrast. On the basis of biodistribution data, tumor uptake of [Ga-68]Ga-BL01 was 10.2 +/- 2.56% injected dose per gram (%ID/g) at 1 h postinjection (p.i.). Spleen (12.6 +/- 2.36 %ID/g) and lungs (13.2 +/- 2.98 % ID/g), organs that express CXCR4, had high uptake as well. Preinjection of LY2510924 reduced average uptake of [Ga-68]Ga-BL01 in tumors by 88%, demonstrating target specificity. The uptake of [Ga-68]Ga-BL01 in tumor increased to 15.3 +/- 1.86 % ID/g at 2 h p.i., with improved contrast. [Lu-177]Lu-BL01 has similar pharmacokinetics as [Ga-68]Ga-BL01 at 1 h p.i. The highest uptake was observed in tumor (14.0 +/- 1.11 %ID/g), followed by the lungs (13.0 +/- 1.27 %ID/g) and spleen (11.6 +/- 1.78 %ID/g). The tumor uptake increased to 16.2 +/- 2.69 %ID/g at 4 h p.i., before declining slightly to 10.1 +/- 1.41 %ID/g at 24 h p.i. Both compounds were stable in vivo, as no metabolites were observed at 5 min p.i. Conclusions: [Ga-68]Ga-BL01 and [Lu-177]Lu-BL01 are a promising theranostic pair for imaging and endoradiotherapy of CXCR4-expressing malignancies.

Validation of two fluoro-analogues of <i>N</i>,<i>N</i>-dimethyl-2-(2′-amino-4′-hydroxymethyl-phenylthio)benzylamine as serotonin transporter imaging agents using microPET	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						HOMADAM; Fluoro-analogues; Carbon-11; MicroPET; Serotonin transporter	IN-VIVO EVALUATION; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; CANDIDATE RADIOLIGANDS; BIOLOGICAL EVALUATION; RADIOSYNTHESIS; C-11; RADIOTRACER; LIGAND; SPECT; DERIVATIVES	Introduction: Carbon-11 (C-11) N,N-dimethy1-2-(2'-amino-4'-hydroxymethyl-phenylthio)benzylamine ([C-11]HOMADAM) has been reported as highly specific and selective positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer showing fast kinetics for the human brain serotonin transporter (SERT). In our continued effort to develop appropriate PET SERT radioligand that can be labeled with either C-11 or fluorine-18 (F-18), two new C-11 labeled analogues of HOMADAM, [C-11]-N,N-dimethy1-2-(2'-amino-5'-fluoro-4'-hydroxymethyl-phenylthio)benzylamine ([C-11]-(2)) and [C-11]-N,N-dimethy1-2-(2'-amino-4-fluoro-4'-hydroxymethyl-phenylthio)benzylamine ([C-11]-(3)) have been synthesized and evaluated along the previously reported [C-11]-N,N-dimethyl-2-(2'-amino-5-fluoro-4'-hydroxymethyl-phenylthio)benzylamine ([C-11]-(1)). Methods: The in vitro competitive binding assays were performed in cells transfected with human SERT (hSERT), human dopamine transporter (hDAT), and human norepinephrine transporter (hNET). [C-11]-(2) and [C-11]-(3) were prepared by methylation of their monomethylbenzylamine precursors 13 and 22 with cyclotron produced [C-11]iodomethane ([C-11]CH3I), respectively. Uptake and kinetics of [C-11]-(2) and [C-11]-(3) in the brain regions of interest were determined in anesthetized rhesus monkeys using Concorde microPET P4. Results: 2 and 3 displayed moderate and high affinity for the SERT with Kis (SERT) = 5.45 and 1.10 nM (vs [H-3]citalopram), respectively. After High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) purification, [C-11]-(2) and [C-11]-(3) were obtained in 23 and 9% radiochemical yield (RCY) and log Ps(7.4) of 1.77 and 1.91, respectively. The microPET images of [C-11]-(2) and [C-11]-(3) showed clear localization in the monkey brain regions rich in SERT with midbrain to cerebellum ratios of 1.75 and 3.86 at 85 min post injection, respectively, comparing to 3.40 for [C-11]-(1), at the same time. [C-11]-(3) was selected for further examination and showed to be specific to the SERT as displacement with citalopram (a potent SERT ligand) reduced radioactivity in SERT rich regions, such as midbrain, to the cerebellum level. Conclusions: Compound 2, the 5'-fluoro-analogue of HOMADAM, had the lowest brain uptake and target to non-target ratios. Compound 3, the 4-fluoro-analogue of HOMADAM, had good brain uptake and higher midbrain and thalamus to cerebellum ratios than compound 1, the 5-fluoro-analogue of HOMADAM. Although 1 and 3 presented better imaging properties than 2, none of the three candidates was suitable to surpass the binding or distributional qualities of the parent HOMADAM. Alternative fluoro-analogues of HOMADAM will soon be characterized, in future work, as SERT radioimaging agents. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, the clinical potential of such compounds has been compromised by cardiovascular side-effects. We report here the pharmacological properties of (3S,4R)-3,4-dihydro-3-hydroxy-2,2-diinethyl-4-(,2-oxo- 1 -piperidinyl)-N-phenyl-2H- 1 -benzopyran-6-sulphonamide (KCO912), a K-ATP channel opener which suppresses AHR at doses devoid of cardiovascular effects. Specific interaction of KCO912 with the native vascular channel and the sulphonylurea receptor subunit (SUR2B) of the vascular K-ATP channel was shown in radioligand binding assays. In rat aortic strips, KCO912 inhibited specific binding of [H-3]P1075 and [H-3]glibenclamide with up to 100% efficacy and with pK(i) values of 8.28 and 7.96, respectively. In HEK cells transfected with the recombinant vascular K-ATP channel (Kir6.1 + SUR2B), the compound elicited a concentration-dependent outward current (pEC(50) 6.8) and in preloaded rat aortic rings it induced a concentration-dependent glibenclamide-sensitive Rb-86(+) efflux (pEC(50) 7.51). Following intratracheal (i.t.) administration of KCO912 to guinea pigs, AHR induced by immune complexes or ozone was rapidly (<5 min) reversed (ED50 values 1 μg/kg and 0.03 μg/kg, respectively). Changes in blood pressure were seen only at doses =100 μg/kg yielding 'therapeutic ratios' of 100 and 3333, respectively. In addition, KCO912 reversed AHR induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS; ED50 0.5 μg/kg i.t.) and a dose of 1 μg/kg i.t. fully reversed AHR induced by subchronic treatment with salbutamol. At doses which suppressed AHR, KCO912 had no antibronchoconstrictor effects in normoreactive guinea pigs. In spontaneously hyperreactive rhesus monkeys, KCO912, given by inhalation, inhibited methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction (ED50) 1.2 μg/kg) but had no significant effects on blood pressure or heart rate at all doses tested (therapeutic ratio >100). In rats given 3 mg/kg of KCO912 by inhalation, the ratio of the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) for lung to the AUC in blood was 190 and the compound was rapidly cleared (initial t(1/2) approximately 30 min).Thus, the wide therapeutic window following administration of KCO912 to the lung seems likely to reflect slow or incomplete passage of KCO912 from the lung into the systemic circulation coupled with rapid removal from the systemic circulation. Thus, when given locally to the airways in both guinea pigs and monkeys, KCO912 suppresses AHR at doses devoid of cardiovascular effects and has a significantly better therapeutic window than representative earlier generation K-ATP channel openers defined in the same models. Given the pivotal role of AHR in the pathophysiology of asthma and the preclinical profile of KCO912, this compound was selected for clinical evaluation.

PSMA-617 is one of the most promising ligands that bind to prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), the cell surface biomarker of CRPC. Of the radiolabeled PSMA ligands developed to date, [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-617 is most commonly used for PSMA positron emission tomography (PET) prior to radioligand therapy (RLT) with [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617. However, the presence of Ga-68 radioactivity (half-life 68 m) in urine at the early PET imaging time point complicates optimization of the therapeutic dose of PSMA-617 labeled with Lu-177 (half-life 6.7 d). Thus, PET imaging with the long-lived positron emitter Zr-89 (half-life 3.3 d) would be better suited in order to optimize the dose of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 as Zr-89 PET allows scans after excretion of the radioactive urine. Until now, PSMA-617 could not be radiolabeled with Zr-89 with high radiochemical yield due to poor incorporation of Zr-89 into 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA). Here we report a novel method for radiolabeling PSMA-617 with Zr-89 and the preliminary results of small-animal PET with [Zr-89]Zr-PSMA-617. Methods: We labeled PSMA-617 with Zr-89 in a 1:1 mixture of DMSO and HEPES buffer at 90 degrees C for 30 min, followed by quality control analysis by HPLC. We then determined the dissociation constant (K-d) and logD values of [Zr-89]Zr-PSMA-617. We obtained PET images of [Zr-89]Zr-PSMA-617 at 24 h in mice bearing both LNCaP (PSMA-positive) and PC-3 (PSMA-negative) tumors (N = 5). The ex vivo [Zr-89]Zr-PSMA-617 biodistribution was then examined separately using tissue samples of LNCaP-bearing mice at 2 h (N = 4) and 24 h (N = 4). Results: [Zr-89]Zr-PSMA-617 was prepared with a radiochemical yield of 70 +/- 9%. The Kd value was 6.8 +/- 3.5 nM. The logD value was -4.05 +/- 0.20. PET images showed the highest uptake in LNCaP tumors (maximum standardized uptake value, SUVmax = 0.98 +/- 0.32) and low uptake in kidneys (SUVmax = 0.18 +/- 0.7) due to the absence of urine radioactivity. Conclusion: [Zr-89]Zr-PSMA-617 was successfully prepared using DMSO and HEPES buffer. [Zr-89]Zr-PSMA-617 visualized PSMA-positive LNCaP tumors in the absence of radioactive urine 24 h p.i. Advances in knowledge and implications for patient care: This method of radiolabeling PSMA-617 with Zr-89 using DMSO would be suitable for future clinical trials. Prediction of radiation dose by using [Zr-89]Zr-PSMA-617 leads to the safe and effective RLT with [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Recently, radiolabeled 1,4,7-triazacyclononane,1-glutaric acid-4,7-acetic acid (NODAGA)-peptide complexes have demonstrated improved in vivo stability and performance compared to their 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) counterparts. Here, we investigated if similar utility could be achieved with mAbs and compared Cu-64-labeled DOTA and NODAGA-immunoconjugates for the detection of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) in a prostate cancer model. Methods: DOTA and NODAGA-immunoconjugates of an EpCAM targeting mAb (mAb7) were synthesized and radiolabeled with Cu-64 (DOTA: 40 degrees C for 1hr; NODAGA: 25 degrees C for 1hr). The average number of chelators per mAb was quantified by isotopic dilution, and the biological activity of the immunoconjugates was evaluated by flow cytometry and ELISA. Radioligand assays were performed to compare cellular uptake and determine the dissociation constant (K-d) and maximum number of binding sites (B-max) for the immunoconjugates using DsRed-transfected PC3-cells. A PC3-DsRed xenograft tumor model was established in nude mice and used to perform biodistribution studies to compare organ uptake and pharmacokinetics. Results: Cu-64-DOTA-mAb7 and Cu-64-NODAGA-mAb7 were prepared with chelator/protein ratios of 2-3 and obtained in comparable radiochemical yields ranging from 59 to 71%. Similar immunoreactivity was observed with both agents, and mock labeling studies indicated that incubation at room temperature or 40 degrees C did not affect potency. Cu-64-NODAGA-mAb7 demonstrated higher in vitro cellular uptake while Cu-64-DOTA-mAb7 had higher Kd and Bmax values. From the biodistribution data, we found similar tumor uptake (13.44+/-1.21%ID/g and 13.24+/-4.86%ID/g for Cu-64-DOTA-mAb7 and Cu-64-NODAGA-mAb7, respectively) for both agents at 24hr, although normal prostate tissue was significantly lower for Cu-64-NODAGA-mAb7. Cu-64-NODAGA-mAb7 also had less accumulation in the liver, suggesting excellent retention of the chelation complex in vivo. This was further confirmed by the higher blood activity of Cu-64-NODAGA-mAb7, which corresponds to increased bioavailability afforded by the enhanced in vivo stability of the agent. Although tumor/muscle ratios were comparable, tumor/prostate ratios were >2-fold and 1.5-fold higher for Cu-64-NODAGA-mAb7 at 24 and 48hr, respectively, and suggest better ability to discriminate tumor tissue with Cu-64-NODAGA-mAb7 in our prostate cancer model. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first comparison of Cu-64-labeled DOTA and NODAGA immunoconjugates in vivo. Our results show favorable in vivo performance for Cu-64-NODAGA-mAb7 which builds upon previous data on our hybrid mAb7 imaging agent by increasing the detection sensitivity for metastatic prostate tumors, as well as for other types of cancer that express EpCAM.

In vitro binding assays showed that the rhenium, surrogate of [Tc-99m]2, Re-2, displayed excellent binding affinity and selectivity towards sigma-2 receptors (K-i = 2,723 and 22 nM for sigma-1 and sigma-2 receptor, respectively). Preparation of [Tc-99m]2 was achieved by heating the S-protected starting material, 1, in the presence of acid, reducing agent (stannous glucoheptonate) and sodium [Tc-99m]pertechnetate. The lipophilic racemic mixture was successfully prepared in 10 to 50% yield and the radiochemical purity was >98%. Separation of the isomers, peak A and peak B, was successfully achieved by using a chiralpak AD column eluted with an isocratic solvent (n-hexane/isopropanol; 3: 1; v/v). The peak A and peak B appear to co-elute with the isomers of the surrogate, Re-2, under the same HPLC condition. Biodistribution studies in tumor bearing mice (mouse mammary adenocarcinoma, cell line 66, which is known to over-express sigma-2 receptors) showed that the racemic [Tc-99m]2 localized in the tumor. Uptake in the tumor was 2.11, 1.30 and 1.11 %dose/gram at 1, 4 and 8 hr post iv injection. respectively, suggesting good uptake and retention in the tumor cells. The tumor uptake was significantly, but incompletely, blocked (about 25-30% blockage) by co-injection of "cold" (+)pentazocine or haloperidol (1 mg/Kg). A majority of the radioactivity localized in the tumor tissue was extractable (>60%), and the HPLC analysis showed that it is the original compound, racemic [Tc-99m]2 (>98% pure). The distribution of the purified peak A and peak B was determined in the same tumor bearing mice at 4 hr post iv injection. The tumor uptake was similar for both isomers, but the blood and peripheral tissue content for the isomer in peak B was higher than that for the isomer in peak A. It is evident that the isomer in peak A displayed significantly better tumor/blood and tumor/muscle ratios. The higher rate of in vivo metabolism was also confirmed by the higher thyroid uptake values for the isomer in peak B as compared to peak A. in summary, a Tc-99m-labeled sigma receptor imaging agent. [Tc-99m]2, has demonstrated the feasibility of using a Tc-99m-labeled agent for imaging sigma receptor expression in tumor cells. This is the first time a subtype-selective Tc-99m-labeled agent for imaging sigma receptor sites is reported. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

For the truncated gastrin radiotracer [In-111-DOTA]MG11 ([(DOTA) DGlu10] gastrin(10-17)), this method led to impressively high tumor-to-kidney ratios. Translation of this concept in the clinic requires the use of certified NEP inhibitors, such as thiorphan (TO) and its orally administered prodrug racecadotril (Race). Besides NEP, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) has also been implicated in the catabolism of gastrin analogs. In the present study, we first compared the effects induced by NEP inhibition (using PA, TO, or Race) and/or by ACE inhibition (using lisinopril, Lis) on the biodistribution profile of [In-111-DOTA]MG11 in mice. In addition, we compared the efficacy of PA and TO at different administered doses to enhance tumor uptake. Methods: [In-111-DOTA]MG11 was coinjected with (a) vehicle, (b) PA (300 mu g), (c) TO (150 mu g), (d) Lis (100 mu g), (e) PA (300 mu g) plus Lis (100 mu g), or (f) 30-40 min after intraperitoneal (ip) injection of Race (3 mg) in SCID mice bearing AR42J xenografts. In addition, [In-111-DOTA]MG11 was coinjected with vehicle, or with progressively increasing amounts of PA (3, 30, or 300 mu g) or TO (1.5, 15, and 150 mu g) in SCID mice bearing twin A431-CCK2R(+/-) tumors. In all above cases, biodistribution was conducted at 4 h postinjection (pi). Results: During NEP inhibition, the uptake of [In-111-DOTA]MG11 in the AR42J tumors impressively increased from 1.8 +/- 1.0 % ID/g (controls) to 15.3 +/- 4.7 % ID/g (PA) and 12.3 +/- 3.6 % ID/g (TO), while with Race tumor values reached 6.8 +/- 2.8 % ID/g. Conversely, Lis had no effect on tumor uptake and no additive effect when coinjected with PA. During the dose dependence study in mice, PA turned out to be more efficacious in enhancing tumor uptake of [In-111-DOTA]MG11 in the CCK2R-positive tumors compared to equimolar amounts of TO. In all cases, renal accumulation remained low, resulting in notable increases of tumor-to-kidney ratios. Conclusions: This study has confirmed NEP as the predominant degrading enzyme of [In-111-DOTA]MG11 and ruled out the involvement of ACE in the in vivo catabolism of the radiotracer. NEP inhibition with the clinically tested NEP inhibitors TO and Race resulted in significant enhancement of tumor-to-kidney ratios vs. controls. However, compared with PA, TO and its prodrug Race induced less potent increases of tumor uptake, highlighting the significance of inhibitor type, administration route, and dose for implementing a first proof-of-principle study in human.

Human heart β-adrenoceptors:: β<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor diversification through 'affinity states' and polymorphism	CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PHARMACOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Annual Meeting of the Australasian-Society-of-Clinical-and-Experimental-Pharmacologists-and-Toxicologists/AHMR Congress	NOV 26-DEC 01, 2006	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA	Australasian Soc Clin & Expt Pharmacologists & Toxicologists, AHMR		beta(1)-adrenoceptor affinity states; beta-adrenoceptor-G(s alpha)-protein coupling; beta-adrenoceptor polymorphism; (-)-CGP 12177; hastening of relaxation; human heart beta-adrenoceptors; human heart failure; phosphodiesterase enzymes; phospholamban	PHOSPHOLAMBAN PHOSPHORYLATION; VENTRICULAR MYOCARDIUM; AUTORADIOGRAPHIC LOCALIZATION; PUTATIVE BETA(4)-ADRENOCEPTOR; BETA(2)-ADRENERGIC RECEPTORS; BETA-1-ADRENERGIC RECEPTORS; HASTENS RELAXATION; CONTRACTILE-FORCE; ADENYLATE-CYCLASE; CARDIAC-FUNCTION	In atrium and ventricle from failing and non-failing human hearts, activation of beta(1)- or beta(2)-adrenoceptors causes increases in contractile force, hastening of relaxation, protein kinase A-catalysed phosphorylation of proteins implicated in the hastening of relaxation, phospholamban, troponin I and C-protein, consistent with coupling of both beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors to stimulatory G(sa)-protein but not inhibitory G(ia)-protein. Two 'affinity states', namely beta(1H) and beta(1L), of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor exist. In human heart, noradrenaline elicits powerful increases in contractile force and hastening of relaxation. These effects are blocked with high affinity by beta-adenoceptor antagonists, including propranolol, (-)-pindolol, (-)-CGP 12177 and carvedilol. Some beta-blockers, typified by (-)-pindolol and (-)-CGP 12177, not only block the receptor, but also activate it, albeit at much higher concentrations (approximately 2 log units) than those required to antagonize the effects of catecholamines. In human heart, both (-)-CGP 12177 and (-)-pindolol increase contractile force and hasten relaxation. However, the involvement of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor was not immediately obvious because (-)-pindolol- and (-)-CGP 12177-evoked responses were relatively resistant to blockade by (-)-propranolol. Abrogation of cardiostimulant effects of (-)-CGP 12177 in beta(1)-/beta(2)-adrenoceptor double-knockout mice, but not beta(2)-adrenoceptor-knockout mice, revealed an obligatory role of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor. On the basis of these results, two 'affinity states' have been designated, the beta(1H)- and beta(1L)-adrenoceptor, where the beta(1H)-adrenoceptor is activated by noradrenaline and blocked with high affinity by beta-blockers and the beta(1L)-adrenoceptor is activated by drugs such as (-)-CGP 12177 and (-)-pindolol and blocked with low affinity by beta-blockers such as (-)-propranolol. The beta(1H)- and beta(1L)-adrenoceptor states are consistent with high- and low-affinity binding sites for (-)-[H-3]-CGP 12177 radioligand binding found in cardiac muscle and recombinant beta(1)-adrenoceptors. There are two common polymorphic locations of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor, at amino acids 49 (Ser/Gly) and 389 (Arg/Gly). Their existence has raised several questions, including their role in determining the effectiveness of heart failure treatment with beta-blockers. We have investigated the effect of long-term maximally tolerated carvedilol administration (> 1 year) on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy (mean left ventricular ejection fraction 23 +/- 7%; n = 135 patients). The administration of carvedilol improved LVEF to 37 +/- 13% (P < 0.005); however, the improvement was variable, with 32% of patients showing pound 5% improvement. Upon segregation of patients into Arg389Gly-beta(1)-adrenoceptors, it was found that carvedilol caused a greater increase in left ventricular ejection faction in patients carrying the Arg389 allele with Arg389Arg > Arg389Gly > Gly389Gly.

Population-based input function for TSPO quantification and kinetic modeling with [<SUP>11</SUP>C]-DPA-713	EJNMMI PHYSICS			English	Article						Population-based input function; Kinetic modeling; [C-11]DPA-713; Normalization	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; IN-VIVO; MICROGLIAL ACTIVATION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; INITIAL EVALUATION; HUMAN BRAIN; PET LIGAND; NEUROINFLAMMATION; BINDING; RADIOLIGAND	Introduction Quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) studies of neurodegenerative diseases typically require the measurement of arterial input functions (AIF), an invasive and risky procedure. This study aims to assess the reproducibility of [C-11]DPA-713 PET kinetic analysis using population-based input function (PBIF). The final goal is to possibly eliminate the need for AIF. Materials and methods Eighteen subjects including six healthy volunteers (HV) and twelve Parkinson disease (PD) subjects from two [C-11]-DPA-713 PET studies were included. Each subject underwent 90 min of dynamic PET imaging. Five healthy volunteers underwent a test-retest scan within the same day to assess the repeatability of the kinetic parameters. Kinetic modeling was carried out using the Logan total volume of distribution (V-T) model. For each data set, kinetic analysis was performed using a patient-specific AIF (PSAIF, ground-truth standard) and then repeated using the PBIF. PBIF was generated using the leave-one-out method for each subject from the remaining 17 subjects and after normalizing the PSAIFs by 3 techniques: (a) Weight(subject)xDose(Injected), (b) area under AIF curve (AUC), and (c) Weight(subject)xAUC. The variability in the V-T measured with PSAIF, in the test-retest study, was determined for selected brain regions (white matter, cerebellum, thalamus, caudate, putamen, pallidum, brainstem, hippocampus, and amygdala) using the Bland-Altman analysis and for each of the 3 normalization techniques. Similarly, for all subjects, the variabilities due to the use of PBIF were assessed. Results Bland-Altman analysis showed systematic bias between test and retest studies. The corresponding mean bias and 95% limits of agreement (LOA) for the studied brain regions were 30% and +/- 70%. Comparing PBIF- and PSAIF-based V-T estimate for all subjects and all brain regions, a significant difference between the results generated by the three normalization techniques existed for all brain structures except for the brainstem (P-value = 0.095). The mean % difference and 95% LOA is -10% and +/- 45% for Weight(subject)xDose(Injected); +8% and +/- 50% for AUC; and +2% and +/- 38% for Weight(subject)xAUC. In all cases, normalizing by Weight(subject)xAUC yielded the smallest % bias and variability (% bias = +/- 2%; LOA = +/- 38% for all brain regions). Estimating the reproducibility of PBIF-kinetics to PSAIF based on disease groups (HV/PD) and genotype (MAB/HAB), the average V-T values for all regions obtained from PBIF is insignificantly higher than PSAIF (%difference = 4.53%, P-value = 0.73 for HAB; and %difference = 0.73%, P-value = 0.96 for MAB). PBIF also tends to overestimate the difference between PD and HV for HAB (% difference = 32.33% versus 13.28%) and underestimate it in MAB (%difference = 6.84% versus 20.92%). Conclusions PSAIF kinetic results are reproducible with PBIF, with variability in V-T within that obtained for the test-retest studies. Therefore, V-T assessed using PBIF-based kinetic modeling is clinically feasible and can be an alternative to PSAIF.

Association Between Amyloid and Tau Accumulation in Young Adults With Autosomal Dominant Alzheimer Disease	JAMA NEUROLOGY			English	Article							MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; FLORBETAPIR F 18; BETA; NEURODEGENERATION; BIOMARKERS; PET; INDIVIDUALS; RADIOLIGAND; DEPOSITION	IMPORTANCE It is critically important to improve our ability to diagnose and track Alzheimer disease (AD) as early as possible. Individuals with autosomal dominant forms of AD can provide clues as to which and when biological changes are reliably present prior to the onset of clinical symptoms. OBJECTIVE To characterize the associations between amyloid and tau deposits in the brains of cognitively unimpaired and impaired carriers of presenilin 1 (PSEN1) E280A mutation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this cross-sectional imaging study, we leveraged data from a homogeneous autosomal dominant AD kindred, which allowed us to examine measurable tau deposition as a function of individuals' proximity to the expected onset of dementia. Cross-sectional measures of carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B positron emission tomography (PET) and flortaucipir F 18 (previously known as AV 1451, T807) PET imaging were assessed in 24 PSEN1 E280A kindred members (age range, 28-55 years), including 12 carriers, 9 of whom were cognitively unimpaired and 3 of whom had mild cognitive impairment, and 12 cognitively unimpaired noncarriers. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We compared carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B PET cerebral with cerebellar distribution volume ratios as well as flortaucipir F 18 PET cerebral with cerebellar standardized uptake value ratios in mutation carriers and noncarriers. Spearman correlations characterized the associations between age and mean cortical Pittsburgh Compound B distribution volume ratio levels or regional flortaucipir standardized uptake value ratio levels in both groups. RESULTS Of the 24 individuals, the mean (SD) age was 38.0 (7.4) years, or approximately 6 years younger than the expected onset of clinical symptoms in carriers. Compared with noncarriers, cognitively unimpaired mutation carriers had elevated mean cortical Pittsburgh Compound B distribution volume ratio levels in their late 20s, and 7 of 9 carriers older than 30 years reached the threshold for amyloidosis (distribution volume ratio level > 1.2). Elevated levels of tau deposition were seen within medial temporal lobe regions in amyloid-positive mutation carriers 6 years before clinical onset of AD in this kindred. Substantial tau deposition in the neocortex was only observed in 1 unimpaired carrier and in those with mild cognitive impairment. beta-Amyloid uptake levels were diffusely elevated in unimpaired carriers approximately 15 years prior to expected onset of mild cognitive impairment. In carriers, higher levels of tau deposition were associated with worse performance on the Mini-Mental State Examination (entorhinal cortex: r = -0.60; P = .04; inferior temporal lobe: r = -0.54; P = .06) and the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer Disease Word List Delayed Recall (entorhinal cortex: r = -0.86; P < .001; inferior temporal lobe: r = -0.70; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The present findings add to the growing evidence that molecular markers can characterize biological changes associated with AD in individuals who are still cognitively unimpaired. The findings also suggest that tau PET imaging may be useful as a biomarker to distinguish individuals at high risk to develop the clinical symptoms of AD and to track disease progression.

Jucaite et al. show that AZD3241 - an inhibitor of the reactive oxygen-generating enzyme myeloperoxidase - reduces binding of the PET ligand [C-11]PBR28 to a microglial marker translocator protein in patients. Myeloperoxidase inhibition may have the potential to reduce neuroinflammation and slow disease progression.Oxidative stress is implicated in neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. Jucaite et al. show that AZD3241 - an inhibitor of the reactive oxygen-generating enzyme myeloperoxidase - reduces binding of the PET ligand [C-11]PBR28 to a microglial marker translocator protein in patients. Myeloperoxidase inhibition may have the potential to reduce neuroinflammation and slow disease progression.Impaired mitochondrial function, oxidative stress and formation of excessive levels of reactive oxygen species play a key role in neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. Myeloperoxidase is a reactive oxygen generating enzyme and is expressed by microglia. The novel compound AZD3241 is a selective and irreversible inhibitor of myeloperoxidase. The hypothesized mechanism of action of AZD3241 involves reduction of oxidative stress leading to reduction of sustained neuroinflammation. The purpose of this phase 2a randomized placebo controlled multicentre positron emission tomography study was to examine the effect of 8 weeks treatment with AZD3241 on microglia in patients with Parkinson's disease. Parkinson patients received either AZD3241 600 mg orally twice a day or placebo (in 3:1 ratio) for 8 weeks. The binding of C-11-PBR28 to the microglia marker 18 kDa translocator protein, was examined using positron emission tomography at baseline, 4 weeks and 8 weeks. The outcome measure was the total distribution volume, estimated with the invasive Logan graphical analysis. The primary statistical analysis examined changes in total distribution volume after treatment with AZD3241 compared to baseline. Assessments of safety and tolerability of AZD3241 included records of adverse events, vital signs, electrocardiogram, and laboratory tests. The patients had a mean age of 62 (standard deviation = 6) years; 21 were male, three female and mean Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III score (motor examination) ranged between 6 and 29. In the AD3241 treatment group (n = 18) the total distribution volume of C-11-PBR28 binding to translocator protein was significantly reduced compared to baseline both at 4 and 8 weeks (P < 0.05). The distribution volume reduction across nigrostriatal regions at 8 weeks ranged from 13-16%, with an effect size equal to 0.5-0.6. There was no overall change in total distribution volume in the placebo group (n = 6). AZD3241 was safe and well tolerated. The reduction of C-11-PBR28 binding to translocator protein in the brain of patients with Parkinson's disease after treatment with AZD3241 supports the hypothesis that inhibition of myeloperoxidase has an effect on microglia. The results of the present study provide support for proof of mechanism of AZD3241 and warrant extended studies on the efficacy of AZD3241 in neurodegenerative disorders.

Is there any correlation with Parkinson's disease?	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						Essential tremor; Parkinson's disease; DaTSCAN	DOPAMINE-TRANSPORTER; DIAGNOSIS; PET; RECOGNITION; RELATIVES; DECLINE	The differential diagnosis between essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson's disease (PD) may be, in some cases, very difficult on clinical grounds alone. In addition, it is accepted that a small percentage of ET patients presenting symptoms and signs of possible PD may progress finally to a typical pattern of parkinsonism. Ioflupane, -u-fluoropropyl-2a-carbomethoxy-3a-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane, also called FP-CIT, labelled with I-123 (commercially known as DaTSCAN) has been proven to be useful in the differential diagnosis between PD and ET and to confirm dopaminergic degeneration in patients with parkinsonism. The aim of this study is to identify dopaminergic degeneration in patients with PD and distinguish them from others with ET using semi-quantitative SPECT I-123-Ioflupane (DaTSCAN) data in comparison with normal volunteers (NV), in addition with the respective ones of patients referred as suffering from ET, as well as, of patients with a PD diagnosis at an initial stage with a unilateral presentation of motor signs. Twenty-eight patients suffering from ET (10 males plus 18 females) and 28 NV (12 males and 16 females) were enroled in this study. In addition, 33 patients (11 males and 22 females) with an established diagnosis of PD with unilateral limb involvement (12 left hemi-body and 21 right hemi-body) were included for comparison with ET. We used DaTSCAN to obtain SPECT images and measure the radiopharmaceutical uptake in the striatum (S), as well as the caudate nucleus (CN) and putamen (P) in all individuals. Qualitative (Visual) interpretation of the SPECT data did not find any difference in the uptake of the radiopharmaceutical at the level of the S, CN and P between NV and ET patients. Reduced accumulation of the radiopharmaceutical uptake was found in the P of all PD patients. Semiquantitative analysis revealed significant differences between NV and ET patients in the striatum, reduced in the latter. There was also a significant reduction in the tracer accumulation in the left putamen of patients with right hemi-parkinsonism compared to ET and NV. Patients with left hemi-parkinsonism, demonstrated reduced radioligand uptake in the right putamen in comparison with ET and NV. Clinical follow-up of 20 patients with ET at (so many months afterwards) revealed no significant change in clinical presentation, particularly no signs of PD. Follow-up DaTSCAN performed in 10 of them (so many months afterwards) was negative in all but one. This one had an equivocal baseline study which deteriorated 12 months later. Our results do not support the hypothesis of a link between essential tremor and Parkinson's disease. However, it appears that ET patients have a small degree of striatal dopaminergic degeneration. If this is due to alterations in the nigrostriatl pathway or of other origin it is not clear. Follow-up studies of essential tremor patients are warranted to assess progression of disease and to understand better the possible cause for striatal dopaminergic degeneration.

J	Gan, LL; Wang, MW; Cheng, MS; Pan, L				Gan, LL; Wang, MW; Cheng, MS; Pan, L			Trachea relaxing effects and β<sub>2</sub>-selectivity of SPFF, a newly developed bronchodilating agent, in guinea pigs and rabbits	BIOLOGICAL & PHARMACEUTICAL BULLETIN			English	Article						beta(2) adrenergic agonist; bronchodilator effect; receptor selectivity; 2-(4-amino-3-chloro-5-trifluomethyl-phenyl)-2-tert-butylamino-ethanol chloride (SPFF)	ADRENOCEPTOR ANTAGONIST; BETA-ADRENOCEPTORS; BINDING	In this paper we evaluated the bronchodilator effects of SPFF [2-(4-amino-3-chloro-5-trifluomethyl-phenyl)2-tert-butylamino-ethanol chloride], a newly synthesized beta(2) adrenergic agonist in guinea pigs and rabbits, in comparison with other beta(2) adrenergic agonists, isoprenaline or salbutamol. We studied in vitro the bronchodilator effects of SPFF and isoprenaline on isolated guinea pig trachea strips with or without the precontraction of bronchocontractors (acetylcholine and histamie). The positive chronotropic effects of SPFF and isoprenaline on isolated guinea pig left atria were also tested in vitro. Potency values (pD(2), pA(2) or ED50) were determined from the cumulative concentration-response curves. The results showed that SPFF and isoprenaline dose-dependently relaxed the isolated guinea pig trachea strips and the pD(2) values of both drugs were 7.66 +/- 0.68 and 8.79 +/- 0.19, respectively. Moreover, we confirmed that the bronchodilator effect of SPFF was due to the activation of beta(2) adrenoceptor because this effect was easily antagonized by ICI-118551 (pA(2) 8.90 +/- 0.01), a specific beta(2) adrenoceptor antagonist. SPFF also dose-dependently relaxed the isolated guinea pig trachea strip precontraction with acetylcholine or histamine with ED50 values of 10.24 +/- 0.7 mum and 550 +/- 38.2 nm, respectively. Furthermore, the positive chronotropic effect of SPFF on isolated guinea pig left atria (pD(2) 5.41 +/- 0.38) was much weaker than that of isoprenaline (pD(2) 8.75 +/- 0.24), which implied that SPFF was more selective to airway beta(2) adrenoceptor than isoprenaline; the beta(1)/beta(2), selectivity assay also showed that SPFF was about 162 times more selective to beta(2) adrenoceptor than isoprenaline. A radioligand binding experiment using guinea pig lung and cardiac ventricle as beta(2) and beta(1) adrenoceptor sources, respectively, also demonstrated that SPFF possesses high affinity (27.3 nm) and selectivity (4.6 fold) to beta(2) adrenoceptors. The protective effects of SPFF and salbutamol on bronchospasm induced by bronchoconstrictor aerosol in guinea pigs in vivo were investigated, and the Konzett and Rossler experiment in rabbits in vivo was also carried out. SPFF significantly prolonged the latency time of histamine and acetylcholine induced asphyxiation collapse in guinea pigs: the ED50 value of SPFF i.g. was 0.32 +/- 0.05 mg . kg(-1) in this experiment. Meanwhile, the ED50 values of salbutamol was 2.37 +/- 0.22, which meant that the bronchorelaxation effect of salbutamol was about 6 times less potent than that of SPFF. The Konzett and Rossler experiment performed in anesthetized rabbit showed that intraduodenal administration of SPFF exerted action of longer duration than salbutamol. From the results above we suggested that SPFF was a potent, long-acting bronchodilator with relatively higher beta(2) adrenoceptor selectivity.

The worldwide incidence and prevalence of the NENs are estimated to be 6/100,000 and 35/100,000, respectively. Those numbers are increasing every decade, requiring higher and higher diagnosis and treatment costs. Radioligand therapy (RLT) using beta-emitting radioisotopes is an efficient and relatively safe method of treatment, typically used as a second-line treatment. RLT tolerability is higher than other available pharmacotherapies (chemotherapy or tyrosine kinase inhibitors). Recent studies show an increase in overall survival among patients treated with RLT. The present study aimed to learn the epidemiology of NENs in Poland and assess the effectiveness of RLT in a high-reference center. A prospective analysis of 167 patients treated with RLT in one of Poland's highest-reference NEN centers was performed. The analysis covered 66 months of observation (1 December 2017-30 May 2023), during which 479 RLT single administrations of radioisotope were given. The standard procedure was to give four courses of [Lu-177]Lu-DOTA-TATE alone, or tandem therapy-[Lu-177]Lu-DOTA-TATE and [Y-90]Y-DOTA-TATE. Grading analysis showed that most patients had non-functioning G2 NEN with a mean Ki-67 of 6.05% (SD +/- 6.41). The most common primary tumor location was the pancreas. Over two-thirds of patients did undergo surgery due to primary tumors or distant metastases. The majority of patients were using lanreotide as a chronically injected somatostatin analog. Median progression-free survival (PFS) on somatostatin analogs was 21.0 (IQR = 29.0) months. Directly after the last course of RLT, disease stabilization was noted in 69.46% of patients, partial regression was noted in 20.36% of patients, complete regression was noted in 0.60% of patients, and progression was noted in 9.58% of patients. In long-term follow-up, the median observation time among patients who underwent four treatment cycles (n = 108) was 29.8 (IQR = 23.9) months. Stabilization of the disease was observed in 55.56% of the patients and progression was observed in 26.85% of the patients, while 17.59% of patients died. Median PFS was 29.3 (IQR 23.9), and the median OS was 34.0 months (IQR 16.0). The mean age of NEN diagnosis is the sixth decade of life. It takes almost three years from NEN diagnosis to the start of RLT. In long-term observation, RLT leads to disease stabilization in over half of the patients with progressive disease. No differences in PFS or OS depend on the radioisotope used for RLT. In Poland, organized coordination of NEN treatment in high-reference centers ensures the continuity of patient care.

The various GABA(A) subunits with region-specific distributions in the brain subserve different functional and physiological roles. For example, the sedative and anticonvulsive effects of classical benzodiazepines are attributed to the alpha(1) subunit, and the alpha(2) and alpha(3) subunits mediate the anxiolytic effect. To optimize pharmacotherapies with improved efficacy and devoid of undesirable side effects for the treatment of anxiety disorders, subtype-selective imaging radiotracers are required to assess target engagement at GABA sites and determine the dose-receptor occupancy relationships. The goal of this work was to characterize, in nonhuman primates, the in vivo binding profile of a novel positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer, [(11) C] ADO, which has been indicated to have functional selectivity for the GABA(A) alpha(2)/alpha(3) subunits. High specific activity [(11) C] ADO was administrated to 3 rhesus monkeys, and PET scans of 120-minute duration were performed on the Focus-220 scanner. In the blood, [(11) C] ADO metabolized at a fairly rapid rate, with similar to 36% of the parent tracer remaining at 30 minutes postinjection. Uptake levels of [(11) C] ADO in the brain were high (peak standardized uptake value of similar to 3.0) and consistent with GABA(A) distribution, with highest activity levels in cortical areas, intermediate levels in cerebellum and thalamus, and lowest uptake in striatal regions and amygdala. Tissue kinetics was fast, with peak uptake in all brain regions within 20 minutes of tracer injection. The one-tissue compartment model provided good fits to regional time-activity curves and reliable measurement of kinetic parameters. The absolute testretest variability of regional distribution volumes (V-T) was low, ranging from 4.5% to 8.7%. Pretreatment with flumazenil (a subtype nonselective ligand, 0.2 mg/kg, intravenous [IV], n = 1), Ro15-4513 (an alpha(5)-selective ligand, 0.03 mg/kg, IV, n = 2), and zolpidem (an a1selective ligand, 1.7 mg/kg, IV, n = 1) led to blockade of [(11) C] ADO binding by 96.5%, 52.5%, and 76.5%, respectively, indicating the in vivo binding specificity of the radiotracer. Using the nondisplaceable volume of distribution (VND) determined fromthe blocking studies, specific binding signals, as measured by values of regional binding potential (BPND), ranged from 0.6 to 4.4, which are comparable to those of [(11) C] flumazenil. In conclusion, [(11) C] ADO was demonstrated to be a specific radiotracer for the GABA(A) receptors with several favorable properties: high brain uptake, fast tissue kinetics, and high levels of specific binding in nonhuman primates. However, subtype selectivity in vivo is not obvious for the radiotracer, and thus, the search for subtype-selective GABA(A) radiotracers continues.

So far, BM dosimetry relies on S values, which are pre-computed for reference anatomies, simplified activity distributions, and a physiological BM distribution. However, mCRPC patients may show a considerable bone lesion load, which leads to a heterogeneous and patient-specific activity accumulation close to BM-bearing sites. Furthermore, the patient-specific BM distribution might be significantly altered in the presence of bone lesions. The aim was to perform BM absorbed dose calculations through Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and to investigate the potential value of image-based BM localization. This study is based on 11 Lu-177-PSMA-617 therapy cycles of 10 patients (10 first cycles), who obtained a pre-therapeutic Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT; quantitative Lu-177 SPECT acquisitions of the abdomen 24 (+CT), 48, and 72 h p.i.; and a Lu-177 whole-body planar acquisition at 24 h post-therapy. Patient-specific 3D volumes of interest were segmented from the Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT, filled with activity information from the Lu-177 data, and imported into the FLUKA MC code together with the patient CT. MC simulations of the BM absorbed dose were performed assuming a physiological BM distribution according to the ICRP 110 reference male (MC1) or a displacement of active BM from the direct location of bone lesions (MC2). Results were compared with those from S values (SMIRD). BM absorbed doses were correlated with the decrease of lymphocytes, total white blood cells, hemoglobin level, and platelets. For two patients, an additional pre-therapeutic Tc-99m-anti-granulocyte antibody SPECT/CT was performed for BM localization. Results Median BM absorbed doses were 130, 37, and 11 mGy/GBq for MC1, MC2, and SMIRD, respectively. Significant strong correlation with the decrease of platelet counts was found, with highest correlation for MC2 (MC1: r = - 0.63, p = 0.04; MC2: r = - 0.71, p = 0.01; SMIRD: r = - 0.62, p = 0.04). For both investigated patients, BM localization via Tc-99m-anti-granulocyte antibody SPECT/CT indicated a displacement of active BM from the direct location of lesions similar to model MC2 and led to a reduction in the BM absorbed dose of 40 and 41% compared to MC1. Conclusion Higher BM absorbed doses were observed for MC-based models; however, for MC2, all absorbed doses were still below 2 Gy. MC1 resulted in critical values for some patients, but is suspected to yield strongly exaggerated absorbed doses by neglecting bone marrow displacement. Image-based BM localization might be beneficial, and future studies are recommended to support an improvement for the prediction of hematoxicities.

Peripheral inflammation causes an increase in mu receptor levels on peripheral terminals of primary afferent neurons. Recent studies indicate that activation of peripheral mu receptors produces antihyperalgesic effects in animals and humans. Here, we describe the in vitro pharmacological and in vivo pharmacokinetic properties of a novel, highly potent, and peripherally restricted mu opioid agonist, [8-(3,3-diphenyl-propyl)-4-oxo-1-phenyl-1,3,8-triaza-spiro[4.5]dec-3yl]-acetic acid (DiPOA). In a radioligand binding assay, DiPOA inhibited [(3)H]-diprenorphine binding to recombinant human mu receptors with a K(i) value of similar to0.8 nM. The rank order of affinity for DiPOA binding to recombinant human opioid receptors was mu > kappa approximate to ORL-1 much greater than delta. DiPOA showed potent agonist effects in a human mu receptor guanosine 5'-O-(3-[(35)S]thio)-triphosphate functional assay, with an EC(50) value of similar to33 nM and efficacy of similar to85% {normalized to the mu agonist, [D-Ala2, MePhe4, Gly(ol)5]enkephalin}. Low potency agonist activity was also seen at ORL-1 and kappa receptors. DiPOA bound competitively to the opioid binding site of human mu receptors as demonstrated by a parallel rightward shift in its concentration-response curve in the presence of increasing concentrations of naltrexone. High and sustained (greater than or equal to5 h) plasma levels for DiPOA were achieved following intraperitoneal administration at 3 and 10 mg/kg; central nervous system penetration, however, was less than or equal to4% of the plasma concentration, even at levels exceeding 1500 ng/ml. As such, DiPOA represents a systemically available, peripherally restricted small molecule mu opioid agonist that will aid in understanding the role played by mu opioid receptors in the periphery. triphosphate functional assay, with an EC(50) value of similar to33 nM and efficacy of similar to85% {normalized to the mu agonist, [D-Ala2, MePhe4, Gly(ol)5]enkephalin}. Low potency agonist activity was also seen at ORL-1 and kappa receptors. DiPOA bound competitively to the opioid binding site of human mu receptors as demonstrated by a parallel rightward shift in its concentration-response curve in the presence of increasing concentrations of naltrexone. High and sustained (greater than or equal to5 h) plasma levels for DiPOA were achieved following intraperitoneal administration at 3 and 10 mg/kg; central nervous system penetration, however, was less than or equal to4% of the plasma concentration, even at levels exceeding 1500 ng/ml. As such, DiPOA represents a systemically available, peripherally restricted small molecule mu opioid agonist that will aid in understanding the role played by mu opioid receptors in the periphery.

The present experiments were carried out in order to see whether they possess presynaptic alpha(2B)-autoreceptors as well. Pieces of atria, vasa deferentia, the occipito-parietal cortex and the hippocampus were prepared from either wildtype (WT) mice or mice in which both the alpha(2A)- and the alpha(2C)-adrenoceptor gene had been disrupted (alpha(2AC)KO). The pieces were incubated with H-3-noradrenaline and then superfused and stimulated electrically. In a first series of experiments, single pulses or brief, autoinhibition-poor pulse trains were used for stimulation. The alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist UK 14,304 (brimonidine) reduced the evoked overflow of tritium in all four tissues from WT mice but did not change it in any tissue from alpha(2AC)KO mice. A different pattern was obtained with medetomidine as alpha(2) agonist. Like UK 14,304, medetomidine reduced the evoked overflow of tritium in all four tissues from WT mice and did not affect overflow in brain slices from alpha(2AC)KO mice; however, in contrast to UK 14,304, medetomidine reduced evoked overflow also in atrial and vas deferens pieces from alpha(2AC)KO mice, although with a lower maximum and potency than in WT preparations. The alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists rauwolscine, phentolamine, prazosin, spiroxatrine and WB 4101 shifted the concentration-response curve of medetomidine in alpha(2AC)KO atria and vasa deferentia to the right. The pK(d) values of the five antagonists against medetomidine in alpha(2AC)KO atria and vasa deferentia correlated with pK(d) values at prototypical alpha(2B) radioligand binding sites but not at alpha(2A) or alpha(2C) binding sites. In a second series of experiments, autoinhibition-rich pulse trains were used for stimulation. Under these conditions, rauwolscine and phentolamine increased the evoked overflow of tritium from alpha(2AC)KO atrial and vas deferens pieces but not from alpha(2AC)KO brain slices. The increase was smaller (by 40% in atria and by 70% in the vas deferens) than previously observed in WT preparations (by 200-400%). In a last series of experiments, mRNA for the alpha(2B)-adrenoceptor was demonstrated by RT-PCR in thoracolumbar sympathetic ganglia from WT, alpha(2A)KO, alpha(2C)KO and alpha(2AC)KO mice but not from alpha(2B)KO mice. The results show that brain noradrenergic neurons express only alpha(2A)- and alpha(2C)-adrenoceptors as autoreceptors. Postganglionic sympathetic neurons, however, can express alpha(2B)-adrenoceptors as presynaptic autoreceptors as well. The alpha(2B)-autoreceptors are activated by medetomidine but not by UK 14,304. They are also activated by previously released noradrenaline. The two-alpha(2)-autoreceptor hypothesis has to be replaced by a three-autoreceptor hypothesis for postganglionic sympathetic neurons.

[<SUP>18</SUP>F]DPA-714: Effect of co-medications, age, sex, BMI and TSPO polymorphism on the human plasma input function	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						Positron Emission Tomography; TSPO; [F-18]DPA-714; Neuroinflammation; Metabolism; CYP	TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN; 18 KDA; RADIATION-DOSIMETRY; DRUG-INTERACTIONS; PET RADIOLIGAND; METABOLISM; BIODISTRIBUTION; INFLAMMATION; INHIBITION; ACTIVATION	PurposeWe aimed to assess the effect of concomitant medication, age, sex, body mass index and 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) binding affinity status on the metabolism and plasma pharmacokinetics of [F-18]DPA-714 and their influence on the plasma input function in a large cohort of 201 subjects who underwent brain and whole-body PET imaging to investigate the role of neuroinflammation in neurological diseases.MethodsThe non-metabolized fraction of [F-18]DPA-714 was estimated in venous plasma of 138 patients and 63 healthy controls (HCs; including additional arterial sampling in 16 subjects) during the 90 min brain PET acquisition using a direct solid-phase extraction method. The mean fraction between 70 and 90 min post-injection ([F-18]DPA-714(70-90)) and corresponding normalized plasma concentration (SUV70-90) were correlated with all factors using a multiple linear regression model. Differences between groups (arterial vs venous measurements; HCs vs patients; high- (HAB), mixed- (MAB) and low-affinity binders (LAB); subjects with vs without co-medications, females vs males were also assessed using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA tests. Finally, the impact of co-medications on the brain uptake of [F-18]DPA-714 at equilibrium was investigated.ResultsAs no significant differences were observed between arterial and venous [F-18]DPA-714(70-90) and SUV70-90, venous plasma was used for correlations. [F-18]DPA-714(70-90) was not significantly different between patients and HCS (59.7 +/- 12.3% vs 60.2 +/- 12.9%) despite high interindividual variability. However, 47 subjects exhibiting a huge increase or decrease of [F-18]DPA-714(70-90) (up to 88% or down to 23%) and SUV70-90 values (2-threefold) were found to receive co-medications identified as inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4, known to catalyse [F-18]DPA-714 metabolism. Comparison between cortex-to-plasma ratios using individual input function (VTIND) or population-based input function derived from untreated HCs (VTPBIF) indicated that non-considering the individual metabolism rate led to a bias of about 30% in VT values. Multiple linear regression model analysis of subjects free of these co-medications suggested significant correlations between [F-18]DPA-714(70-90) and age, BMI and sex while TSPO polymorphism did not influence the metabolism of the radiotracer. [F-18]DPA-714 metabolism fell with age and BMI and was significantly faster in females than in males. Whole-body PET/CT exhibited a high uptake of the tracer in TSPO-rich organs (heart wall, spleen, kidneys horizontal ellipsis ) and those involved in metabolism and excretion pathways (liver, gallbladder) in HAB and MAB with a strong decrease in LAB (-89% and -85%) resulting in tracer accumulation in plasma (4.5 and 3.3-fold increase).ConclusionAny co-medication that inhibits or induces CYP3A4 as well as TSPO genetic status, age, BMI and sex mostly contribute to interindividual variations of the radiotracer metabolism and/or concentration that may affect the input function of [F-18]DPA-714 and consequently its human brain and peripheral uptake.

The correlation between PSA levels and Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET parameters is also investigated. Methods 31 patients with biochemical failure after primary PC treatment with curative intent (median age 71.0 years) were enrolled in the analysis. The median PSA value was 2.0 ng/mL (range = 0.1 - 130.0 ng/mL) and the median Gleason score was 7 (range = 5 - 9). 8/31 (25.8 %) of the included patients had a PSA value < 0.5 ng/ml. All patients underwent dynamic PET/CT (dPET/CT) scanning (60 min) of the pelvis and lower abdomen as well as whole-body PET/CT with Ga-68-PSMA-11. dPET/CT assessment was based on qualitative evaluation, SUV calculation, and quantitative analysis based on a two-tissue compartment model and a non-compartmental approach leading to the extraction of fractal dimension (FD). Results 22/31 patients (71.0 %) were Ga-68-PSMA-11-positive, while 9/31 (29.0 %) patients were Ga-68-PSMA-11-negative. The median PSA value in the Ga-68-PSMA-11-positive group was significantly higher (median = 2.35 ng/mL; range = 0.19 - 130.0 ng/mL) than in the Ga-68-PSMA-11-negative group (median value: 0.34 ng/mL; range = 0.10 - 4.20 ng/mL). A total of 76 lesions were semi-quantitatively evaluated. PC recurrence-associated lesions demonstrated a mean SUVaverage = 12.4 (median = 9.0; range = 2.2 - 84.5) and mean SUVmax = 18.8 (median = 14.1; range = 3.1 - 120.3). Dynamic PET/CT studies of the pelvis revealed the following mean values for the PC recurrence-suspicious lesions: K-1 = 0.26, k(3) = 0.30, influx = 0.14 and FD = 1.24. Time-activity curves derived from PC-recurrence indicative lesions revealed an increasing Ga-68-PSMA-11 accumulation during dynamic PET acquisition. Correlation analysis revealed a moderate, but significant, correlation between PSA levels and the number of lesions detected on Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT (r = 0.54) and between PSA levels and SUVaverage (r = 0.48) or SUVmax (r = 0.44). Conclusions Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT demonstrated an overall detection rate of 71.0 % 60 min p.i. of the radiotracer in a mixed patient population with respect to PSA levels and including patients with very low PSA values. Higher PSA values were associated with a higher detection rate. The tracer uptake in PC-recurrence-indicative lesions is increasing during the 60 minutes of dynamic PET acquisition.

These rare tumors tend to grow slowly and are notoriously difficult to localize, at least in the early stages. Surgical removal is the only definitive therapeutic option for neuroendocrine tumors and relief from hyperfunctional status. The effectiveness of surgical treatment is invariably dependent upon the complete surgical excision of all tumor tissue, because microscopic and occult disease not readily seen by the surgeon may remain in situ, leading to shortened survival. Therefore, pre- and intraoperative localization of the primary as well as of metastatic tumors is of utmost importance. Radioguided surgery (RGS) is an intraoperative technique that enables the surgeon to localize radiolabelled tissue based on the characteristics of the various tissues. Concerning gastroenteropancreatic tumors (GEP), intraoperative gamma probe examination is able to reveal small tumor sites accumulating (In-111-DTPA-D-Phe(1))-pentetreotide more efficiently (>90%) than somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (68%-77%), because lesions with a size smaller than 5 mm in greatest dimension could be identified. Furthermore, RGS identified 57% more lesions when compared to the "palpating finger" of the surgeon. In medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), surgical removal of the tumor is the first and most efficient treatment of the disease. Persistent or increasing serum calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels imply tumor recurrence after thyroid ablation. For imaging recurrent MTC many radiopharmaceuticals have been used to visualize tumor sites, but none of them has shown excellent sensitivity. Preoperative somatostatin receptor scintigraphy and intraoperative RGS in patients with recurrent MTC demonstrate only part of the tumor sites and cannot visualize small tumor sites (less than 10 mm). In comparison, RGS using Tc-99m(V)-DMSA detects metastases with a size of 5 mm in diameter, whereas the "palpating finger" of the surgeon localized metastases with a size of more than 1 cm in diameter. In patients with recurrent MTC, intraoperative gamma probe examination is able to localize over 30% more tumor lesions when compared with conventional preoperative imaging. modalities and surgical findings. MIBG scintigraphy is the most sensitive technique for the detection and staging of neuroblastoma (sensitivity 92%; specificity nearly 100%). Intraoperative RGS with iodine labelled MIBG has been developed to improve the definition of tumor Limits or to localize small, nonpalpable tumors. Comparison of I-123- and I-125-labelled MIBG revealed a sensitivity of 91% and 92%, respectively; the specificity of I-125 (85%) was significantly higher than that of I-123 (55%). In addition to scintigraphy of the adrenal glands by precusors of adrenal hormones, imaging with a radiolabelled somatostatin analogue is possible; however, (In-111-DTPA-D-Phe(1))-pentetreotide is not specific for any adrenal disease or function and the relatively high radioligand accumulation in the kidneys limited the use for detection of tumors in the area of the adrenal glands.

In this report, a first-in-human positron emission tomography (PET) study was conducted with the potent and selective KOR agonist tracer, [C-11]GR103545, to determine an appropriate kinetic model for analysis of PET imaging data and assess the test-retest reproducibility of model-derived binding parameters. The non-displaceable distribution volume (V-ND) was estimated from a blocking study with naltrexone. In addition, KOR occupancy of PF-04455242, a selective KOR antagonist that is active in preclinical models of depression, was also investigated. Methods: For determination of a kinetic model and evaluation of test-retest reproducibility, 11 subjects were scanned twice with [C-11]GR103545. Seven subjects were scanned before and 75 min after oral administration of naltrexone (150 mg). For the KOR occupancy study, six subjects were scanned at baseline and 1.5 h and 8 h after an oral dose of PF-04455242 (15 mg, n = 1 and 30 mg, n = 5). Metabolite-corrected arterial input functions were measured and all scans were 150 min induration. Regional time-activity curves (TACs) were analyzed with 1- and 2-tissue compartment models (1TC and 2TC) and the multilinear analysis (MA1) method to derive regional volume of distribution (V-T). Relative test-retest variability (TRV), absolute test-retest variability (aTRV) and intra-class coefficient (ICC) were calculated to assess test-retest reproducibility of regional V-T. Occupancy plots were computed for blocking studies to estimate occupancy and V-ND. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of PF-04455242 was determined from occupancies and drug concentrations in plasma. [C-11]GR103545 in vivo K-D was also estimated. Results: Regional TACs were well described by the 2TC model and MA1. However, 2TC V-T was sometimes estimated with high standard error. Thus MA1 was the model of choice. Test-retest variability was similar to 15%, depending on the outcome measure. The blocking studies with naltrexone and PF-04455242 showed that V-T was reduced in all regions; thus no suitable reference region is available for the radiotracer. VND was estimated reliably from the occupancy plot of naltrexone blocking (V-ND = 3.4 +/- 0.9 mL/cm(3)). The IC50 of PF-04455242 was calculated as 55 ng/mL. [C-11]GR103545 in vivo K-D value was estimated as 0.069 nmol/L. Conclusions: [C-11]GR103545 PET can be used to image and quantify KOR in humans, although it has slow kinetics and variability of model-derived kinetic parameters is higher than desirable. This tracer should be suitable for use in receptor occupancy studies, particularly those that target high occupancy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

A kit to prepare <SUP>111</SUP>In-DTPA-trastuzumab (Herceptin) Fab fragments injection under GMP conditions for imaging or radioimmunoguided surgery of HER2-positive breast cancer	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Breast cancer; Trastuzumab Fab; In-111; kit; Good manufacturing practices (GMP); Radioimmunoguided surgery (RIGS); Imaging	EPIDERMAL-GROWTH-FACTOR; HER-2 NEU; XENOGRAFTS; TRASTUZUMAB; OVEREXPRESSION; EXPRESSION; DELIVERY	Introduction: The human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) gene is amplified in 25% of invasive breast cancers, and receptor overexpression has been noted in up to 60% of early stages of the disease [ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)]. Preclinical studies have revealed high tumor/blood ratios (>27:1) for In-111-labeled Fab fragments of the HER2 monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab (Herceptin) (In-111-DTPA-trastuzumab Fab) at 72 h pi in athymic mice bearing subcutaneous human breast cancer xenografts. Our aim in this study was to formulate a kit for preparation of In-111-DTPA-trastuzumab Fab injection under good manufacturing practice (GMP) conditions suitable for human administration in a Phase I clinical trial of imaging and radioimmunoguided surgery (RIGS) of HER2-positive breast cancer. Methods: Fab fragments were produced by digestion of trastuzumab IgG (Herceptin) with immobilized papain for 20 h at 37 degrees C. Fab fragments were purified by ultrafiltration, then reacted with a 10-fold molar excess of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) dianhydride. DTPA-Fab fragments were purified,, then sterilized by filtration into unit dose glass vials (kits). Kits were tested against specifications for volume (0.9-1.1 ml), protein concentration (0.45-0.55 mg/ml), pH (5.5-6.5), DTPA substitution (0.5-4.0 mol DTPA/mol Fab), appearance (clear, colorless and particle free), labeling efficiency (>= 85%), and sterility and apyrogenicity (USP XXXII). Immunoreactivity of In-111-DTPA-trastuzumab Fab towards HER2 was measured by saturation radioligand binding assays using SKBR-3 human breast cancer cells (specifications: K-a=0.6-9.6x10(7) L/mol; B-max=0.6-10.4x10(6) sites/cell). In-111-DTPA-trastuzumab Fab injection was prepared by adding 80-100 MBq of (InCl3)-In-111 to a single kit vial and incubating for 30 min at room temperature. In-111-DTPA-trastuzumab Fab was assayed for the amount of radioactivity and tested for pH, radiochemical purity (RCP), appearance and sterility. Results: Pure and homogeneous Fab fragments were produced. Eleven lots of kits met established quality specifications. The labeling efficiency with In-111 was 90.6 +/- 2.2%. In-111-DTPA-trastuzumab Fab bound specifically to HER2 on SKBR-3 cells (K-a=4.8 +/- 2.5x10(7) L/mol and B-max=1.6 +/- 0.8x10(6) sites/cell). Thirteen lots of In-111-DTPA-trastuzumab injection met all established specifications. Kits were stable for 90 days and In-111-DTPA-trastuzumab Fab injection was stable for 24 h stored at 4 degrees C. Conclusions: A kit was formulated under GMP conditions for the preparation of In-111-DTPA-trastuzumab Fab injection suitable for human administration. The kits were approved by Health Canada.

It has been recognized as a pivotal contributor to cell death and inflammation in various physiological and pathological processes. RIPK1 deficiency or dysregulation in humans can cause severe immunodeficiency and neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Recently, diverse structures of RIPK1 inhibitors have been developed as potential therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases and other pathological inflammatory processes. 7-oxo-2,4,5,7-tetrahydro-6H-pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridine (Compound 5 or TZ7774) was reported as a novel RIPK1 inhibitor with a Ki of 0.91 nM that can suppress necroptosis in mouse and human cells. To develop a radiotracer for investigating the RIPK1 in vivo, we radiosynthesized [11C]TZ7774 and performed preliminary in vitro and in vivo evaluations in rodents and macaque. Methods: Synthesis of the desmethyl precursor TZ7790 was performed and optimized. The radiosynthesis of [11C] TZ7774 was achieved through TZ7790 reacting with [11C]methyl iodide via N-methylation. Ex vivo biodistribution of [11C]TZ7774 was performed in normal Sprague-Dawley rats. Characterization of [11C]TZ7774 in response to inflammation was performed using ex vivo biodistribution study in normal and LPS treated (10 mg/ kg) C57BL/6 mice, and in vitro autoradiography and immunohistochemistry of the spleen. MicroPET brain study of [11C]TZ7774 in the macaque was also performed. Results and conclusions: The radiosynthesis of [11C]TZ7774 was achieved with good radiochemical yield (30-40%, decay corrected to the end of bombardment (EOB)), high chemical purity (>90%), high radiochemical purity (>99%), and high molar activity (>207 GBq/mu mol, decay corrected to EOB). Biodistribution studies in Sprague-Dawley rats showed [11C]TZ7774 has a high brain uptake of 0.53 (%ID/g) at 5 min post injection; pancreas, spleen, kidney, and liver also showed a relatively high initial uptake of 0.49, 0.41, 0.62, and 0.95 at 5 min respectively. Uptake of [11C]TZ7774 increased in LPS-treated C57BL/6 mice by 40.9%, 90.4%, and 54.9% in liver, spleen, and kidney respectively. In vitro autoradiography study also revealed increased uptake of [11C] TZ7774 in the spleen of LPS-treated mice. Further characterization with immunohistochemistry confirmed increased expression of RIPK1 in red and white pulp of the spleen for mice pre-treated with LPS. MicroPET demonstrated that [11C]TZ7774 had good initial brain uptake in macaque with an (SUV) of similar to 3.7 at 6-10 min, and quickly washed out from brain. These data confirm successful radiosynthesis of a RIPK1 specific radiotracer [11C]TZ7774. Our preliminary studies showed good response to LPS-induced inflammation in rodents and good uptake in macaque brain. [11C]TZ7774 has a potential to image RIPK1 related necroptosis and inflammatory processes.

Optimization of solid-phase extraction (SPE) in the preparation of [<SUP>18</SUP>F] D3FSP: A new PET imaging agent for mapping Aβ plaques	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; Brain imaging; Deuterium; Radiosynthesis; Solid-phase extraction	PERFORMANCE LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; AMYLOID-BETA; IN-VIVO; BRAIN; RADIOLIGAND; DRUG; PURIFICATION; PATHOGENESIS; DEPOSITION	Introduction: Alzheimer's disease is a common neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by the presence of Ai3 plaques in the brain. The FDA has approved the use of Amyvid (fiorbetapir f18, AV-45) as a PET imaging agent for detecting A beta plaques in the living human brain. In an attempt to reduce N-demethylation in vivo by taking advantage of more stable C-D bonds, an analog of AV-45, [F-18]D3FSP ([(18)]7), was synthesized to improve image contrast for detecting and monitoring the A beta plaques. A convenient and improved preparation of [F-18] D3FSP ([F-18]7) is needed for widespread clinical application. We report herein the optimization of the radiosynthesis and solid-phase extraction (SPE) procedure. Methods: Radiosyntheses of [F-18]D3FSP ((11)8F]7) under different fluorination conditions were evaluated, and the intermediate, containing an N-Boc protecting group, was deprotected using different acids. One of the major objectives was to simplify the final purification step via SPE to avoid the commonly employed HPLC purification and maximize the radiochemical yields of [F-18]D3FSP ([F-18]7) while simultaneously removing several chemical impurities (pseudocarriers). Washing various solid-phase cartridges with different combinations of ethanol/ water and acetonitrile/water was explored to optimize the purification step. To evaluate the potential interference in Ar3 plaques imaging from the presence of pseudocarriers, each chemical was identified and quantified by LC/MS and HPLC. An in vitro binding assay was employed to evaluate the binding affinities of [F-18]D3FSP ([F-18]7) and the pseudocarriers to A beta plaques using postmortem AD brain tissue. Results: Using the optimized radiosynthesis method and SPE purification, the final dose of [F-18]D3FSP ([F-18]7) was obtained in 50 min with a very low content of pseudocarriers (21.7 5.5 pg). The radiochemical yield was 44.4 +/- 5.7% (decay corrected), and the radiochemical purity was >95%. SPE-purified doses of [F-18]D3FSP ([F-18]7) displayed excellent binding affinity and specificity for A beta plaques as measured in an in vitro binding assay using AD brain homogenates, and the OH-pseudocarrier, 8 (K-i = 19.5 +/- 0.5 nM), and the CIpseudocarrier, 10 (K-i = 18.6 +/- 3.9 nM), showed lower binding affinities for A beta plaques than those of AV-45 (K-i = 8.6 +/- 0.5 nM) and D3FSP, 7 (K-i= 9.8 +/- 0.5 nM). Conclusions: An optimized radiosynthesis and fast SPE purification method suitable for the preparation of clinical doses of [F-18]D3FSP ([F-18]7) was accomplished. The results of quality control tests and binding studies suggested that the SPE-purified doses of [F-18]D3FSP ([F-18]7) are appropriate for imaging A beta plaques in the human brain.

J	Tränkle, C; Kostenis, E; Mohr, K				Tränkle, C; Kostenis, E; Mohr, K			Muscarinic allosteric modulation:: M<sub>2</sub>/M<sub>3</sub> subtype selectivity of gallamine is independent of G-protein coupling specificity	NAUNYN-SCHMIEDEBERGS ARCHIVES OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						muscarinic M-2 receptor; muscarinic M-3 receptor; gallamine; allosteric modulation; G protein coupling	SITE-DIRECTED MUTAGENESIS; M-2 RECEPTOR-BINDING; ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; ANTAGONIST BINDING; MAMMALIAN-CELLS; IDENTIFICATION; LIGANDS; RADIOLIGAND; ALCURONIUM; MODES	Among the five subtypes of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, the sensitivity towards allosteric modulation is generally higher in M-2 and M-4 receptors that preferentially couple to inhibitory G-proteins of the G(i/o) type than in M-1, M-3, and M-5 that preferentially couple to stimulatory G-proteins such as G(q/11). We aimed to check whether the high allosteric sensitivity of the M-2 receptor compared to M-3 is related to the differential G-protein coupling preference. As the third intracellular loop (i3) is known to be the major determinant in receptor G-protein coupling specificity, we used wild-type M-2 and M-3 receptors and the related chimeric constructs with exchanged i3-loops, i.e., M-2 containing M-3-i3 (M-2/M-3-i3) and M-3 containing M-2-i3 (M-3/M-2-i3). The allosteric effect of the archetypal modulator gallamine on the dissociation and the equilibrium binding of [H-3]N-methylscopolamine ([H-3]NMS) was measured in membranes of mouse A9L cells stably expressing the wild-type and the chimeric receptors (4 mM Na2HPO4, 1 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4, 23 degreesC). The dissociation of [3H]NMS was monophasic under all conditions studied. Control values of t(1/2), were (means SEM, n=4-7): M-2: 3.8 +/-0.2 min, M-2/M-3-i3: 4.8 +/-0.3 min. M-3: 43.3 +/-4.2 min. M-3/M-2-i3: 41.1 +/-3.6 min. At M-2 receptors, 0.2 muM gallamine allosterically reduced the apparent rate constant of dissociation k(-1) to 51 +/-5% of the control value (n=5). At M2/M-3-i3 the allosteric potency of gallamine was not significantly changed (0.2 muM gallamine --> k-1=61 +/-4%, n=7). At M-3, a 20-fold higher concentration was required for an equieffective allosteric action (10 muM gallamine ---> k-1=51 5%, n=5). The potency of gallamine at M-3/M-2-i3 was not increased compared with M3 receptors (10 muM gallamine -> k(-1)=73 +/-2%, n=4) but even significantly diminished. [H-3]NMS equilibrium binding experiments revealed that neither the binding constants of gallamine at free receptor subtypes (pK(A,M2): 7.57 +/-0.04, n=4; pK(A,M3): 5.56 +/-0.13, n=3) nor the factors of negative cooperativity with [H-3]NMS (alpha (M2)=31 +/-1, alpha (M3)=3 +/-0.4) were affected by the exchanged i3-loops (PKA,M2/M3-i3: 7.65 +/-0.03, PKA.M3/(M2-i2): 5.35 +/-0.24, alpha (M2/M3-i3)= 30 +/-2, alpha (M3/M2-i2)=3 +/-0.7). In conclusion, the different sensitivities Of M2 and M3 receptors towards allosteric modulation by gallamine are not related to the G-protein coupling specificity of the receptors.

Methods: Trastuzumab Fab were labeled with In-111 or Cu-64 by conjugation to 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane N, N', N '', N'''-tetraacetic acid (DOTA). The purity of In-111- and Cu-64-DOTA-trastuzumab Fab was measured by SDS-PAGE and HPLC. HER2 binding affinity was determined in saturation radioligand binding assays using SKBR-3 cells (1.3 x 106 HER2/cell). MicroSPECT/CT and microPET/CT were performed in athymic mice bearing s.c. BT-20 and MDA-MB-231 xenografts with low (0.5 to 1.6 x 10(5) receptors/cell), MDA-MB-361 tumors with intermediate (5.1 x 10(5) receptors/cell) or SKOV-3 xenografts with high HER2 expression (1.2 x 10(6) receptors/cell) at 24 h p.i. of 70 MBq (10 mu g) of In-111-DOTA-trastuzumab Fab or 22 MBq (10 mu g) of Cu-64-DOTA-trastuzumab Fab or irrelevant In-111- or Cu-64-DOTA- rituximab Fab. Tumor and normal tissue uptake were quantified in biodistribution studies. Results: In-111- and Cu-64-DOTA-trastuzumab were >98% radiochemically pure and bound HER2 with high affinity (K-d = 20.4 +/- 2.5 nM and 40.8 +/- 3.5 nM, respectively). MDA-MB-361 and SKOV-3 tumors were most clearly imaged using In-111- and Cu-64-DOTA-trastuzumab Fab. Significantly higher tumor/blood (T/B) ratios were found for In-111-DOTA-trastuzumab Fab than In-111-DOTA-rituximab Fab for BT-20, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-361 xenografts, and there was a direct association between T/B ratios and HER2 expression. In contrast, tumor uptake of Cu-64-DOTA-trastuzumab Fab was significantly higher than Cu-64-DOTA-rituximab Fab in MDA-MB-361 tumors but no direct association with HER2 expression was found. Both In-111- and Cu-64-DOTA-trastuzumab Fab imaged small (5 to 10 mm) or larger (10 to 15 mm) MDA-MB-361 tumors. Higher blood, liver, and spleen radioactivity were observed for Cu-64-DOTA-trastuzumab Fab than In-111-DOTA-trastuzumab Fab. Conclusions: We conclude that In-111-DOTA-trastuzumab Fab was more specific than Cu-64-DOTA-trastuzumab Fab for imaging HER2-positive tumors, especially those with low receptor density. This was due to higher levels of circulating radioactivity for Cu-64-DOTA-trastuzumab Fab which disrupted the relationship between HER2 density and T/B ratios. Use of alternative chelators that more stably bind Cu-64 may improve the association between T/B ratios and HER2 density for Cu-64-labeled trastuzumab Fab.

The purpose of this study was to develop an imaging protocol and analytic method to measure regional 5-HT transporter binding potential (BP) with [C-11]McN 5652 in humans. Methods: The arterial input function and brain uptake of (+)-[C-11]McN 5652 and (-)-[C-11]McN 5652, the active and inactive enantiomers, respectively, were measured in 6 healthy volunteers. Results: (+)-[C-11]McN 5652 concentrated in brain regions rich in 5-HT transporters (midbrain, thalamus, basal ganglia, and medial temporal lobe structures), whereas the uptake of (-)-[C-11]McN 5652 was more uniformly distributed. Total distribution volumes (VT) were derived using kinetic 2-compartment analysis and graphic analysis. VT derived by both methods were highly correlated. (+)-[C-11]McN 5652 regional V-T ranged from 18 +/- 2 mL/g in the cerebellum to 46 +/- 13 mL/g in the midbrain. (-)-[C-11]McN 5652 regional V-T ranged from 10 +/- 2 mL/g in the cerebellum to 14 +/- 3 mL/g in the thalamus. (+)-[C-11]McN 5652 V-T were higher than (-)-[C-11]McN 5652 V-T, in all regions, including the cerebellum, a region devoid of 5-HT transporters. Blocking experiments were also performed in baboons with saturating doses of citalopram and in humans with nonsaturating doses of paroxetine. Cerebellar and neocortical (+)-[C-11]McN 5652 V-T were unaffected by pretreatment with 5-HT transporter blockers. In areas of high receptor concentration (midbrain, caudate, and thalamus) 5-HT transporter blockers decreased (+)-[C-11]McN 5652 V-T to the level of cerebellum (+)-[C-11]McN 5652 VT. Conclusion: These experiments indicate that the use of the difference between (+)- and (-)-[C-11]McN 5652 V-T to define specific binding to 5-HT transporters leads to an overestimation of specific binding. 5-HT transporter BP was derived as the difference between the regional and cerebellar (+)-[C-11]McN 5652 V-T BP values were in good agreement with the distribution of 5-HT transporters in the human brain, except for regions of relatively low 5-HT transporter concentration, such as the prefrontal cortex, where no specific binding was detected using (+)-[C-11]McN 5652. (+)-[C-11]McN 5652 is an appropriate radiotracer to quantify 5-HT transporters in regions with relatively high concentration of 5-HT transporters, such as the midbrain, thalamus, and basal ganglia, and should prove useful in elucidating abnormalities of 5-HT transmission in neuropsychiatric conditions.

In this retrospective analysis, we compared pretherapeutic clinical dosimetry data of both PSMA ligands. Methods: Six patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer underwent both Lu-177-rhPSMA-7.3 and Lu-177-PSMA I&T pretherapeutic dosimetry. Whole-body scintigraphy was performed at 1 h, 4 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 7 d after injection. Regions of interest covering the whole body, organs, bone marrow, and tumor lesions were drawn for each patient. Absorbed doses for individual patients and pretherapeutic applications were calculated using OLINDA/EXM. To facilitate the comparison of both ligands, we introduced the therapeutic index (TI), defined as the ratio of mean pretherapeutic doses to tumor lesions over relevant organs at risk. Results: Mean whole-body pretherapeutic effective doses for Lu-177-rhPSMA-7.3 and Lu-177-PSMA I&T were 0.12 +/- 0.07 and 0.05 +/- 0.03 Sv/GBq, respectively. Mean absorbed organ doses for Lu-177-rhPSMA-7.3 and Lu-177-PSMA I&T were, for example, 1.65 +/- 0.28 and 0.73 +/- 0.18 Gy/GBq for the kidneys, 0.19 +/- 0.09 and 0.07 +/- 0.03 Gy/GBq for the liver, 2.35 +/- 0.78 and 0.80 +/- 0.41 Gy/GBq for the parotid gland, and 0.67 +/- 0.62 and 0.30 +/- 0.27 Gy/GBq for the bone marrow, respectively. Tumor lesions received mean absorbed doses of Lu-177-rhPSMA-7.3 and Lu-177-PSMA I&T of 6.44 +/- 6.44 and 2.64 +/- 2.24 Gy/GBq, respectively. The mean TIs for the kidneys were 3.7 +/- 2.2 and 3.6 +/- 2.2 for Lu-177-rhPSMA-7.3 and Lu-177-PSMA I&T, respectively, and those for the bonemarrowwere 15.2 +/- 10.2 and 15.1 +/- 10.2 for Lu-177-rhPSMA-7.3 and (17)7Lu-PSMA I&T, respectively. Conclusion: Pretherapeutic clinical dosimetry confirmed preclinical results of mean absorbed doses for tumors that were 2-3 times higher for Lu-177-rhPSMA-7.3 than for Lu-177-PSMA I& T. Absorbed doses to normal organs also tended to be higher for Lu-177-rhPSMA-7.3, resulting overall in similar average TIs for both radiopharmaceuticals with considerable interpatient variability. Lu-177-rhPSMA-7.3 has promise for a therapeutic efficacy similar to that of Lu-177-PSMA I&T at smaller amounts of injected activity, simplifying radiation safety measurements (especially for large patient numbers or dose escalation regimens).

Astroglial alpha-synuclein-positive cytoplasmic accumulations have been shown post-mortem in patients with Parkinson's disease and therefore astroglia may play an important role in the initiation and progression of Parkinson's disease. Imidazoline 2 binding sites are expressed on activated astroglia in the cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia and brainstem; therefore, by measuring imidazoline 2 binding site levels we can indirectly evaluate astrogliosis in patients with Parkinson's disease. Here, we aimed to evaluate the role of astroglia activation in vivo in patients with Parkinson's disease using C-11-BU99008 PET, a novel radioligand with high specificity and selectivity for imidazoline 2 binding sites. Twenty-two patients with Parkinson's disease and 14 healthy control subjects underwent 3T MRI and a 120-min C-11-BU99008 PET scan with volume of distribution (V-T) estimated using a two-tissue compartmental model with a metabolite corrected arterial plasma input function. Parkinson's disease patients were stratified into early (n = 8) and moderate/advanced (n = 14) groups according to disease stage. In early Parkinson's disease, increased C-11-BU99008 VT uptake was observed in frontal (P = 0.022), temporal (P = 0.02), parietal (P = 0.026) and occipital (P = 0.047) cortical regions compared with healthy controls. The greatest C-11-BU99008 VT increase in patients with early Parkinson's disease was observed in the brainstem (52%; P = 0.018). In patients with moderate/advanced Parkinson's disease, loss of C-11-BU99008 VT was observed across frontal (P = 0.002), temporal (P < 0.001), parietal (P = 0.039), occipital (P = 0.024), and insula (P < 0.001) cortices; and in the subcortical regions of caudate (P < 0.001), putamen (P < 0.001) and thalamus (P < 0.001); and in the brainstem (P = 0.018) compared with healthy controls. In patients with Parkinson's disease, loss of C-11-BU99008 VT in cortical regions, striatum, thalamus and brainstem correlated with longer disease duration (P < 0.05) and higher disease burden scores, measured with Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (P < 0.05). In the subgroup of patients with moderate/advanced Parkinson's disease, loss of C-11-BU99008 VT in the frontal (r = 0.79; P = 0.001), temporal (r = 0.74; P = 0.002) and parietal (r = 0.89; P < 0.001) cortex correlated with global cognitive impairment. This study demonstrates in vivo the role of astroglia in the initiation and progression of Parkinson's disease. Reactive astroglia observed early in Parkinson's disease could reflect a neuroprotective compensatory mechanisms and pro-inflammatory upregulation in response to alpha-synuclein accumulation. However, as the disease progresses and significant neurodegeneration occurs, astroglia lose their reactive function and such loss in the cortex has clinical relevance in the development of cognitive impairment.

This work aimed at investigating the temporal relationship between microglial activation and clinical progression of Alzheimer's disease. First, in a large cohort of patients with Alzheimer's disease we analysed the predictive value of microglial activation assessed by F-18-DPA-714 PET imaging on functional, cognitive and MRI biomarkers outcomes after a 2-year follow-up. Second, we analysed the longitudinal progression of F-18-DPA-714 binding in patients with Alzheimer's disease by comparison with controls, and assessed its influence on clinical progression. At baseline, all participants underwent a clinical assessment, brain MRI, C-11-PiB, F-18-DPA-714 PET imaging and TSPO genotyping. Participants were followed-up annually for 2 years. At the end of the study, subjects were asked to repeat a second F-18-DPA-714-PET imaging. Initial F-18-DPA-714 binding was higher in prodromal (n = 33) and in demented patients with Alzheimer's disease (n = 19) compared to controls (n = 17). After classifying patients into slow and fast decliners according to functional (Clinical Dementia Rating change) or cognitive (Mini-Mental State Examination score decline) outcomes, we found a higher initial F-18-DPA-714 binding in slow than fast decliners. Negative correlations were observed between initial F-18-DPA-714 binding and the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes score increase, the MMSE score loss and the progression of hippocampal atrophy. This suggests that higher initial F-18-DPA-714 binding is associated with better clinical prognosis. Twenty-four patients with Alzheimer's disease and 15 control subjects performed a second DPA-PET. We observed an increase of F-18-DPA-714 in patients with Alzheimer's disease as compared with controls (mean 13.2% per year versus 4.2%) both at the prodromal (15.8%) and at the demented stages (8.3%). The positive correlations between change in F-18-DPA-714 binding over time and the three clinical outcome measures (Clinical Dementia Rating, Mini-Mental State Examination, hippocampal atrophy) suggested a detrimental effect on clinical Alzheimer's disease progression of increased neuroinflammation after the initial PET examination, without correlation with PiB-PET uptake at baseline. High initial (FF)-F-18-DPA-714 binding was correlated with a low subsequent increase of microglial activation and favourable clinical evolution, whereas the opposite profile was observed when initial F-18-DPA-714 binding was low, independently of disease severity at baseline. Taken together, our results support a pathophysiological model involving two distinct profiles of microglial activation signatures with different dynamics, which differentially impact on disease progression and may vary depending on patients rather than disease stages.

In this study, the improved quantitative performance of the HRRT was evaluated in comparison with a previously developed lower resolution PET system, the ECAT FIR. The radioligand [C-11]MADAM was chosen for the purpose since it provides a signal for serotonin transporter (5-HTT) binding in cortical and sub-cortical brain regions of different sizes and expressing different 5-HTT densities. A secondary objective was to assess the effect of partial volume effect (PVE) correction on the cross-comparability between the two systems. Method: Six male control subjects (ages 20-35 yr) were examined twice using the HRRT and the HR system, respectively. Regions of interest (ROIs) included cortical regions (frontal cortex, temporal cortex, insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and hippocampus), sub-cortical regions (caudate, putamen, thalamus, dorsal brainstem and ventral midbrain) and cerebellum. The ROIs were manually delineated on T1-weighted MRI-images and subsequently applied to both HRRT and HR images. Regional binding potential (BPND) values were calculated with the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) using cerebellum as the reference region. The percent difference in BPND between the systems was calculated for each ROI. In addition, both HRRT and HR data were corrected for PVE using established MRI-based methods described by Meltzer and Muller-Gartner. The effect of PVE correction (PVEc) on the agreement between the systems was assessed via percent difference calculation and linear regression analysis. Results: Quantification with SRTM showed that regional BPND values for [C-11]MADAM were on average 23% higher for the HRRT than those obtained by the HR system. More specifically, BPND measured with HRRT was 31.1 +/- 48.1% higher in neocortical/limbic regions and 14.6 +/- 20.9% higher in sub-cortical regions. The effect of PVEc varied between regions. After correction according to Muller-Gartner, the agreement between systems was best in the neocortical/limbic regions (3.7 +/- 22.5%). With the exception of the caudate, in which the agreement was improved by approximately 17% using the Meltzer method, the effect of PVEc in sub-cortical regions was less pronounced. Linear regression analysis showed improved correlation between the two systems after PVEc, particularly in the neocortical/limbic regions. Conclusion: As expected, BPND values measured with the HRRT were higher than those measured with the HR due to higher resolution and recovery. The difference in BPND between the two systems was approximately 30% in the neocortical/limbic regions. PVEc improved the agreement between the systems in particular for the neocortical/limbic regions. In these regions, the best agreement was found after applying Muller-Gartner's PVEc. The demonstrated agreement provides an opportunity for combining data between the two systems in clinical studies aimed at evaluating receptor/transporter availability in cortical brain regions.

Associations between Normal Organs and Tumor Burden in Patients Imaged with Fibroblast Activation Protein Inhibitor-Directed Positron Emission Tomography	CANCERS			English	Article						PET; [Ga-68]Ga-FAPI; theranostics; radioligand therapy; fibroblast activation protein	CANCER; BIODISTRIBUTION	Simple Summary Several radiolabeled fibroblast activation protein targeted inhibitors (FAPI) have been developed for molecular imaging and therapy. A potential correlation of radiotracer uptake in normal organs and extent of tumor burden may have consequences for a theranostic approach using ligands structurally associated with [Ga-68]Ga-FAPI, as one may anticipate decreased doses to normal organs in patients with extensive tumor load. In the present proof-of-concept study investigating patients with solid tumors, we aimed to quantitatively determine the normal organ biodistribution of [Ga-68]Ga-FAPI-04, depending on the extent of tumor. Except for a trend towards significance in the myocardium, we did not observe any relevant associations between PET-based tumor burden and normal organs. Those preliminary findings may trigger future studies to determine possible implications for theranostic approaches and FAP-directed drugs, as one may expect an unchanged dose for normal organs even in patients with higher tumor load. (1) Background: We aimed to quantitatively investigate [Ga-68]Ga-FAPI-04 uptake in normal organs and to assess a relationship with the extent of FAPI-avid tumor burden. (2) Methods: In this single-center retrospective analysis, thirty-four patients with solid cancers underwent a total of 40 [Ga-68]Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT scans. Mean standardized uptake values (SUVmean) for normal organs were established by placing volumes of interest (VOIs) in the heart, liver, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, and bone marrow. Total tumor burden was determined by manual segmentation of tumor lesions with increased uptake. For tumor burden, quantitative assessment included maximum SUV (SUVmax), tumor volume (TV), and fractional tumor activity (FTA = TV x SUVmean). Associations between uptake in normal organs and tumor burden were investigated by applying Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. (3) Results: Median SUVmean values were 2.15 in the pancreas (range, 1.05-9.91), 1.42 in the right (range, 0.57-3.06) and 1.41 in the left kidney (range, 0.73-2.97), 1.2 in the heart (range, 0.46-2.59), 0.86 in the spleen (range, 0.55-1.58), 0.65 in the liver (range, 0.31-2.11), and 0.57 in the bone marrow (range, 0.26-0.94). We observed a trend towards significance for uptake in the myocardium and tumor-derived SUVmax (rho = 0.29, p = 0.07) and TV (rho = -0.30, p = 0.06). No significant correlation was achieved for any of the other organs: SUVmax (rho <= 0.1, p >= 0.42), TV (rho <= 0.11, p >= 0.43), and FTA (rho <= 0.14, p >= 0.38). In a sub-analysis exclusively investigating patients with high tumor burden, significant correlations of myocardial uptake with tumor SUVmax (rho = 0.44; p = 0.03) and tumor-derived FTA with liver uptake (rho = 0.47; p = 0.02) were recorded. (4) Conclusions: In this proof-of-concept study, quantification of [Ga-68]Ga-FAPI-04 PET showed no significant correlation between normal organs and tumor burden, except for a trend in the myocardium. Those preliminary findings may trigger future studies to determine possible implications for treatment with radioactive FAP-targeted drugs, as higher tumor load or uptake may not lead to decreased doses in the majority of normal organs.

Characterization in nonhuman primates of (<i>R</i>)-[<SUP>18</SUP>F]OF-Me-NB1 and (<i>S</i>)-[<SUP>18</SUP>F]OF-Me-NB1 for imaging the GluN2B subunits of the NMDA receptor	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						[F-18]OF-Me-NB1; GluN2B subunit; NMDA receptor; PET imaging; Nonhuman primates	D-ASPARTATE RECEPTOR; BIOLOGICAL EVALUATION; PET RADIOLIGAND; IFENPRODIL; RADIOTRACER; NR2B	Purpose GluN2B containing N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) play an essential role in neurotransmission and are a potential treatment target for multiple neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, including stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. (R)-[F-18]OF-Me-NB1 was reported to be more specific and selective than (S)-[F-18]OF-Me-NB1 for the G1uN2B subunits of the NMDAR based on their binding affinity to GluN2B and sigma-1 receptors. Here we report a comprehensive evaluation of (R)-[F-18]OF-Me-NB1 and (S)-[F-18]OF-Me-NB1 in nonhuman primates. Methods The radiosynthesis of (R)-[F-18]OF-Me-NB1 and (S)-[F-18]OF-Me-NB1 started from F-18-fluorination of the boronic ester precursor, followed by removal of the acetyl protecting group. PET scans in two rhesus monkeys were conducted on the Focus 220 scanner. Blocking studies were performed after treatment of the animals with the GluN2B antagonist Co101,244 or the sigma-1 receptor antagonist FTC-146. One-tissue compartment (1TC) model and multilinear analysis-1 (MA1) method with arterial input function were used to obtain the regional volume of distribution (V-T, mL/cm(3)). Occupancy values by the two blockers were obtained by the Lassen plot. Regional non-displaceable binding potential (BPND) was calculated from the corresponding baseline V-T and the V-ND derived from the occupancy plot of the Co101,244 blocking scans. Results (R)- and (S)-[F-18]OF-Me-NB1 were produced in > 99% radiochemical and enantiomeric purity, with molar activity of 224.22 +/- 161.69 MBq/nmol at the end of synthesis (n=10). Metabolism was moderate, with similar to 30% parent compound remaining for (R)-[F-18]OF-Me-NB1 and 20% for (S)-[F-18]OF-Me-NB1 at 30 min postinjection. Plasma free fraction was 1-2%. In brain regions, both (R)- and (S)-[F-18]OF-Me-NB1 displayed fast uptake with slower clearance for the (R)- than (S)-enantiomer. For (R)-[F-18]OF-Me-NB1, both the 1TC model and MA1 method gave reliable estimates of regional V-T values, with MA1 V-T (mL/cm(3)) values ranging from 8.9 in the cerebellum to 12.8 in the cingulate cortex. Blocking with 0.25 mg/kg of Co101,244 greatly reduced the uptake of (R)-[F-18]OF-Me-NB1 across all brain regions, resulting in occupancy of 77% and V-ND of 6.36, while 0.027 mg/kg of FTC-146 reduced specific binding by 30%. Regional BPND, as a measure of specific binding signals, ranged from 0.40 in the cerebellum to 1.01 in the cingulate cortex. Conclusions In rhesus monkeys, (R)-[F-18]OF-Me-NB1 exhibited fast kinetics and heterogeneous uptake across brain regions, while the (S)-enantiomer displayed a narrower dynamic range of uptake across regions. A Blocking study with a GluN2B antagonist indicated binding specificity. The value of BPND was> 0.5 in most brain regions, suggesting good in vivo specific binding signals. Taken together, results from the current study demonstrated the potential of (R)-[F-18]OF-Me-NB1 as a useful radiotracer for imaging the GluN2B receptors.

Tau Positron Emission Tomographic Findings in a Former US Football Player With Pathologically Confirmed Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy	JAMA NEUROLOGY			English	Article								Importance Biomarkers for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) are currently lacking. The radiotracer fluorine F 18-labeled (F-18)-flortaucipir (FTP) detects tau pathology in Alzheimer disease, and positron emission tomography (PET) with FTP shows elevated binding in individuals at risk for CTE. No study, however, has assessed the correlation between in vivo FTP PET and postmortem tau in CTE. Objective To assess the regional association between in vivo FTP binding and postmortem tau pathology in a patient with pathologically confirmed CTE. Design, Setting, and Participants A white male former National Football League player with 17 years of US football exposure was clinically diagnosed with traumatic encephalopathy syndrome at a neurology tertiary referral center. F-18-Fludeoxyglucose, carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh compound B, and FTP PET were performed 52 months prior to death, and magnetic resonance imaging, 50 months prior to death. Brain images were assessed qualitatively for abnormalities blinded to autopsy data. Autopsy was performed using a neurodegenerative research protocol. The FTP standardized uptake value ratios (inferior cerebellar gray reference region) and W-score (age-adjusted z-score) maps were compared with phosphorylated tau immunohistochemical analysis with monoclonal antibody CP13. Main Outcomes and Measures Qualitative and quantitative comparisons between antemortem FTP PET and tau pathology at autopsy. Results Flortaucipir uptake was distributed in a patchy, frontotemporal-predominant pattern that overlapped with regions showing neurodegeneration on magnetic resonance imaging and hypometabolism on F-18-fludeoxyglucose PET. Pathological assessment revealed stage 4 CTE; limbic argyrophilic grain disease; stage 2 limbic-predominant, age-related transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 encephalopathy; and Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage 3. F-18-Flortaucipir W-maps matched areas of high postmortem tau burden in left fusiform and inferior temporal gyri and juxtacortical frontal white matter. High FTP W-scores with low tau burden were found in the basal ganglia, thalamus, motor cortex, and calcarine cortex. No regions with low FTP W-scores corresponded to areas with high pathological tau burden. A modest correlation, which did not reach statistical significance (rho = 0.35, P = .17), was found between FTP standardized uptake value ratio and tau area fraction at the regional level. Conclusions and Relevance In this patient, FTP PET findings during life showed a modest correspondence with postmortem pathology in CTE. These findings suggest that FTP may have limited utility as a tau biomarker in CTE. Question Does in vivo binding of the tau positron emission tomography radioligand fluorine F 18-labeled (F-18)-flortaucipir correspond to tau pathology in chronic traumatic encephalopathy? Findings In a patient with pathologically confirmed chronic traumatic encephalopathy, F-18-flortaucipir positron emission tomography performed 52 months prior to death showed a patchy, frontotemporal pattern corresponding qualitatively to regions with tau pathology found at autopsy. There was a modest correlation between regional F-18-flortaucipir standardized uptake value ratios and tau immunohistochemistry area fraction that did not reach statistical significance. Meaning Findings in this case suggest that F-18-flortaucipir may have limited utility as a biomarker of tau pathology in chronic traumatic encephalopathy. This case report compares in vivo F-18-flortaucipir at positron emission tomography with regions of tau pathology found at postmortem analysis in a former US football player with pathologically confirmed chronic traumatic encephalopathy.

Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein and Cerebral Expression of Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor Subtype 5 in Men with Fragile X Syndrome: A Pilot Study	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						anterior cingulate cortex; correlation coefficient; fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1); linear regression; neurodevelopmental disorders; neuroimaging; temporal cortex; positron emission tomography (PET); radiotracer; thalamus	AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER; MOUSE MODEL; PET; MECHANISMS; F-18-FPEB; FMRP	Multiple lines of evidence suggest that a deficiency of Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) mediates dysfunction of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR(5)) in the pathogenesis of fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most commonly known single-gene cause of inherited intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Nevertheless, animal and human studies regarding the link between FMRP and mGluR(5) expression provide inconsistent or conflicting findings about the nature of those relationships. Since multiple clinical trials of glutamatergic agents in humans with FXS did not demonstrate the amelioration of the behavioral phenotype observed in animal models of FXS, we sought measure if mGluR(5) expression is increased in men with FXS to form the basis for improved clinical trials. Unexpectedly marked reductions in mGluR(5) expression were observed in cortical and subcortical regions in men with FXS. Reduced mGluR(5) expression throughout the living brains of men with FXS provides a clue to examine FMRP and mGluR(5) expression in FXS. In order to develop the findings of our previous study and to strengthen the objective tools for future clinical trials of glutamatergic agents in FXS, we sought to assess the possible value of measuring both FMRP levels and mGluR(5) expression in men with FXS. We aimed to show the value of measurement of FMRP levels and mGluR(5) expression for the diagnosis and treatment of individuals with FXS and related conditions. We administered 3-[F-18]fluoro-5-(2-pyridinylethynyl)benzonitrile ([F-18]FPEB), a specific mGluR 5 radioligand for quantitative measurements of the density and the distribution of mGluR(5)s, to six men with the full mutation (FM) of FXS and to one man with allele size mosaicism for FXS (FXS-M) Utilizing the seven cortical and subcortical regions affected in neurodegenerative disorders as indicator variables, adjusted linear regression of mGluR(5) expression and FMRP showed that mGluR(5) expression was significantly reduced in the occipital cortex and the thalamus relative to baseline (anterior cingulate cortex) if FMRP levels are held constant (F(7,47) = 6.84, p < 0.001).These findings indicate the usefulness of cerebral mGluR(5) expression measured by PET with [F-18]FPEB and FMRP values in men with FXS and related conditions for assessments in community facilities within a hundred-mile radius of a production center with a cyclotron. These initial results of this pilot study advance our previous study regarding the measurement of mGluR(5) expression by combining both FMRP levels and mGluR(5) expression as tools for meaningful clinical trials of glutamatergic agents for men with FXS. We confirm the feasibility of this protocol as a valuable tool to measure FMRP levels and mGluR(5) expression in clinical trials of individuals with FXS and related conditions and to provide the foundations to apply precision medicine to tailor treatment plans to the specific needs of individuals with FXS and related conditions.

To provide a comprehensive basis for nevertheless observed slight differences in tracer biodistribution and dosimetry, the characteristics of [Ga-68]HA-DOTATATE were investigated in a detailed preclinical study. Methods: Affinities of Ga-nat-HA-DOTATATE and Ga-nat-DOTATATE to sst(1-5) were determined using membrane preparations and [I-125]SST-28 as radioligand. Internalization into AR42J cells was studied in dual-tracer studies with [I-125]TOC as internal reference. Biodistribution was investigated using AR42J tumor-bearing CD1 mice, and specificity of tracer uptake was confirmed in competition studies by coinjection of 0.8 mg TOC/kg. Results: Sst(2) affinities (IC50) of [Ga-nat]HA-DOTATATE (1.4 +/- 0.8 nM, logP: -3.16) and [Ga-nat]DOTATATE (1.2 +/- 0.6 nM, logP: -3.69) were nearly identical. Both compounds displayed IC50 > 1 mu M for sst(1,3,4), while sst(5) affinity was markedly increased for Ga-nat-HA-DOTATATE (102 +/- 65 nM vs > 1 mu M for Ga-nat-DOTATATE). [Lu-nat]HA-DOTATATE and [Lu-nat]DOTATATE showed slightly lower, identical sst(2) affinities (2.0 +/- 1.6 and 2.0 +/- 0.8 nM, respectively) and sst(3) affinities of 93 +/- 1 and 162 +/- 16 nM. Internalization of [Ga-68]HA-DOTATATE was tenfold higher than that of [I-125] TOC but only sixfold higher for [Ga-68]DOTATATE and [Lu-177]HA-DOTATATE. While [Ga-68]HA-DOTATATE and [Ga-68]DOTATATE had shown similar target-and non-target uptake in patients, biodistribution studies in mice at 1 h post injection (n = 5) revealed slightly increased non-specific uptake of [Ga-68]HA-DOTATATE in the blood, liver, and intestines (0.7 +/- 0.3, 1.0 +/- 0.2, and 4.0 +/- 0.7 %iD/g vs 0.3 +/- 0.1, 0.5 +/- 0.1, and 2.7 +/- 0.8 %iD/g for [Ga-68]DOTATATE). However, sst-mediated accumulation of [Ga-68]HA-DOTATATE in the pancreas, adrenals, and tumor was significantly enhanced (36.6 +/- 4.3, 10.8 +/- 3.2, and 33.6 +/- 10.9 %iD/g vs 26.1 +/- 5.0, 5.1 +/- 1.4, and 24.1 +/- 4.9 %iD/g, respectively). Consequently, tumor/background ratios for [Ga-68]HA-DOTATATE in the AR42J model are comparable or slightly increased compared to [Ga-68]DOTATATE. Conclusions: The present preclinical data fully confirm the general biodistribution pattern and excellent in vivo sst-targeting characteristics previously observed for [Ga-68]HA-DOTATATE in patients. The effect of slightly enhanced lipophilicity on background accumulation and normal organ dose is compensated by the high uptake of [Ga-68]HA-DOTATATE in tumor. Thus, [Ga-68]HA-DOTATATE represents a fully adequate, freely available substitute for [Ga-68]DOTATATE and, given the superb sst-targeting characteristics of [Lu-177]HA-DOTATATE in vitro, potential applicability for sst-targeted PRRT.

Therefore, PSMA has emerged as a very attractive target for developing radiopharmaceuticals for the diagnosis, e.g., by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, and radiotherapy of prostate cancer. The aim of this study was to develop F-18-labeled PSMA ligands bearing different F-18-glycosyl moieties to study the effect on the in vivo clearance behavior of radiotracers in addition to their tumor binding ability. Therefore, we applied click chemistry-based F-18-fluoroglcosylation using 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]-fluoroglucosyl azide or 6-deoxy-6-[F-18]fluoroglucosyl azide as prosthetic groups for the radiosynthesis of the F-18-fluoroglycosylated glutamate-urea-lysine-based PSMA inhibitors 2-[F-18]FGlc-PSMA ([F-18]7) and 6-[F-18]FGlc-PSMA ([F-18]8). The PSMA inhibitory potencies were determined by competitive radioligand binding assays using Tc-99m-MIP-1404 and PSMA-expressing PC-3 PIP cells, revealing moderate PSMA inhibitory potencies for [F-18]7 (IC50 = 234 nM) and [F-18]8 (IC50 = 59 nM). Biodistribution and small-animal PET studies were performed using PSMA-positive PC-3 PIP and PSMA-negative PC-3 tumor-bearing nude mice. PSMA inhibitors [F-18]7 and [F-18]8 were obtained in high radioactivity yields of 19-22% (nondecay-corrected, referred to [F-18]fluoride) and with molar activities of 71-136 GBq/mu mol. In the biodistribution studies, the uptake levels of [F-18]7 and [F-18]8 in PC-3 PIP tumors were 13 +/- 3%ID/g and 6 +/- 5%ID/g at 60 min p.i., respectively. PSMA-negative PC-3 tumors and all other tissues had negligible low uptake values. Interestingly, [F-18]7 had high uptake in the kidneys, with remarkable retention from 30 to 60 min p.i. (74 to 72%ID/g). In contrast, [F-18]8 revealed a low uptake of 7.5%ID/g in the kidneys at 30 min p.i. and was rapidly cleared through the kidney (0.9%ID/g at 120 min p.i.). In direct comparison to a Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET scan of the same mouse, [F-18]7 and [F-18]8 showed 2- to 3-fold higher uptake values in PC-3 PIP tumors. Both radiotracers were solely cleared via the kidneys and not via the hepatobiliary pathway. The regional kidney distribution pattern of the tracers in the kidneys revealed that Ga-68-PSMA-11 and 2-[F-18]FGlc-PSMA([F-18]7) mainly accumulated in the cortex of the kidneys, whereas 6-[F-18]FGlc-PSMA([F-18]8) showed a 10-fold lower kidney uptake with accumulation in the inner medulla or pelvis of the kidneys. Overall, the developed 6-fluoroglucosyl derivative [F-18]8, with its considerably low kidney uptake and fast clearance, demonstrated high uptake in PSMA-positive tumors in vivo. This candidate could, therefore, be valuable for translation into the clinic.

Population-based input function and image-derived input function for [<SUP>11</SUP>C](<i>R</i>)-rolipram PET imaging: Methodology, validation and application to the study of major depressive disorder	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Population-based input function; Image-derived input function; [C-11](R)-rolipram; Major depressive disorder	BODY-SURFACE-AREA; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; CEREBRAL METABOLIC-RATE; BLOOD-SAMPLING SITE; DRUG CONCENTRATION; MARKED DEPENDENCE; BRAIN PET; QUANTIFICATION; PHARMACOKINETICS; GLUCOSE	Quantitative PET studies of neuroreceptor tracers typically require that arterial input function be measured. The aim of this study was to explore the use of a population-based input function (PBIF) and an image-derived input function (IDIF) for [C-11](R)-rolipram kinetic analysis, with the goal of reducing - and possibly eliminating - the number of arterial blood samples needed to measure parent radioligand concentrations. Methods: A PBIF was first generated using [C-11](R)-rolipram parent time-activity curves from 12 healthy volunteers (Group 1). Both invasive (blood samples) and non-invasive (body weight, body surface area, and lean body mass) scaling methods for PBIF were tested. The scaling method that gave the best estimate of the Logan-V-T values was then used to determine the test-retest variability of PBIF in Group 1 and then prospectively applied to another population of 25 healthy subjects (Group 2), as well as to a population of 26 patients with major depressive disorder (Group 3). Results were also compared to those obtained with an image-derived input function (IDIF) from the internal carotid artery. In some subjects, we measured arteriovenous differences in [C-11](R)-rolipram concentration to see whether venous samples could be used instead of arterial samples. Finally, we assessed the ability of IDIF and PBIF to discriminate depressed patients (MDD) and healthy subjects. Results: Arterial blood-scaled PBIF gave better results than any non-invasive scaling technique. Excellent results were obtained when the blood-scaled PBIF was prospectively applied to the subjects in Group 2 (V-T ratio 1.02 +/- 0.05; mean +/- SD) and Group 3 (V-T ratio 1.03 +/- 0.04). Equally accurate results were obtained for two subpopulations of subjects drawn from Groups 2 and 3 who had very differently shaped (i.e. "flatter" or "steeper") input functions compared to PBIF (V-T ratio 1.07 +/- 0.04 and 0.99 +/- 0.04, respectively). Results obtained via PBIF were equivalent to those obtained via IDIF (V-T ratio 0.99 +/- 0.05 and 1.00 +/- 0.04 for healthy subjects and MDD patients, respectively). Retest variability of PBIF was equivalent to that obtained with full input function and IDIF (14.5%, 15.2%, and 14.1%, respectively). Due to [C-11](R)-rolipram arteriovenous differences, venous samples could not be substituted for arterial samples. With both IDIF and PBIF, depressed patients had a 20% reduction in [C-11](R)-rolipram binding as compared to control (two-way ANOVA: p = 0.008 and 0.005, respectively). These results were almost equivalent to those obtained using 23 arterial samples. Conclusion: Although some arterial samples are still necessary, both PBIF and IDIF are accurate and precise alternatives to full arterial input function for [C-11](R)-rolipram PET studies. Both techniques give accurate results with low variability, even for clinically different groups of subjects and those with very differently shaped input functions. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Propagation of this paradigm to other radiopeptide families has been greatly hampered by the inherent poor metabolic stability of systemically administered peptide analogs. We hypothesized that the in vivo coadministration of specific enzyme inhibitors would improve peptide bioavailability and hence tumor uptake. Through single coinjection of the neutral endopeptidase inhibitor phosphoramidon (PA), we were able to provoke remarkable rises in the percentages of circulating intact somatostatin, gastrin, and bombesin radiopeptides in mouse models, resulting in a remarkable increase in uptake in tumor xenografts in mice. Methods: The peptide conjugates [DOTA-Ala(1)]SS14 (DOTA-Ala-Gly-c[Cys-Lys-Asn-Phe-Phe-Trp-Lys-Thr-Phe-Thr-Ser-Cys]-OH), PanSB1 (DOTA-PEG(2)-DTyr-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-bAla-His-Phe-Nle-NH2), and DOTA-MG11 (DOTA-DGlu-Ala-Tyr-Gly-Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH2) were labeled with In-111 by 20 min of heating at an acidic pH. Metabolic stability was studied with high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of blood samples collected 5 min after the injection of the test radiopeptide alone or with PA into mice. Biodistribution was studied after injection of each In-111-labeled radiopeptide alone or after coinjection of PA in tumor-bearing severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Results: The amount of intact [In-111-DOTA-Ala(1)] SS14 detected in the mouse circulation at 5 min after the injection of PA increased impressively-from less than 2% to 86%-whereas the uptake in AR4-2J xenografts rose from less than 1 percentage injected dose per gram of tissue (% ID/g) to 14% ID/g at 4 h after injection. Likewise, the coadministration of PA resulted in a marked increase in the amount of circulating intact In-111-PanSB1-from12% to 80%-at 5 min after injection, and radioligand uptake in human PC-3 xenografts in SCID mice escalated from less than 4 % ID/g to greater than 21 % ID/g at 4 h after injection. In a similar manner, the coadministration of PA resulted in an equally impressive increase in intact [(111)InDOTA] MG11 levels in the mouse bloodstream-from less than 5% to 70%-at 5 min after injection, leading to a remarkable increase in radiotracer uptake-from 2 % ID/g to greater than 15 % ID/g-in both AR4-2J tumors and A431(CCKR1) tumors (i.e., tumors induced by A431 cells transfected to stably express the human cholecystokinin subtype 2 receptor) in mice at 4 h after injection. This effect was well visualized by SPECT/CT imaging of AR4-2J tumor-bearing mice at 4 h after injection. Conclusion: The results of this study clearly demonstrate that the coadministration of key enzyme inhibitors can effectively prolong the survival of radiolabeled peptides in the circulation, securing their safe transit to the target. This strategy clearly provoked an unprecedented increase in radiolabel accumulation in tumor xenografts in mice; this increase might translate into higher diagnostic sensitivity or improved therapeutic efficacy of radiopeptide drugs in cancer patients. Hence, our findings provide exciting new opportunities for the application of biodegradable (radio) peptide drugs of either natural or synthetic origin as well as for the rationale design of analogs that are stable in vivo.

It shows 97% and 81% homology with the corresponding rat and human receptors, respectively. The msst(5) receptor messenger RNA (mRNA) is present at low levels in the adult mouse brain, with significant expression in a few nuclei only, e.g. in the septum (lateral septal nuclei) or the amygdala (medial amygdaloid nucleus); very few signals were observed in the mesencephalon, metencephalon, and myelencephalon (except the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve). The msst(5) receptor was stably expressed in the hamster fibroblast cell line CCL39-SRE-Luci, which harbours the luciferase reporter gene driven by the serum responsive element. [I-125]LTT-SRIF-28 ([Leu(8), D-Trp(22), I-125-Tyr(25)]-SRIF-28), [I-125]Tyr(10)-CST, [I-125]CGP 23996, and [I-125]Tyr(3)-octreotide labelled msst(5) receptors with high affinity (pK(d) values: 11.0, 10.15, 9.75 and 9.43) and in a saturable manner, but defined different Bmax values: 697, 495, 540 and 144 fmoles/mg, respectively. [I-125]LTT-SRIF-28-labelled sites displayed the following rank order: SRIF28> rCST-14> somatuline > CCP-23996= SRIF-14= octreotide, whereas [I-125]Tyr(3)-octreotide-labelled sites displayed a different profile: octreotide > SRIF-28> rCST-14= somatuline > SRIF-14> CGP-23996. The pharmacological profiles determined with [I-125]LTT-SRIF-28, [I-125]CGP 23996 and [I-125]Tyr(10)-CST correlated highly significantly (r(2) =0.88-0.99), whereas [I-125]Tyr(3)-octreotide binding was rather divergent (r(2) =0.77). Also, human and mouse sst(5) receptor profiles are very different, e.g. r(2) =0.385 for [I-125]Tyr(10)-CST and r(2) =0.323 for [I-125]LTT-SRIF-28-labelled sites. Somatostatin induces expression of luciferase reporter gene in CCL39-SRE-Luci cells. The profile was consistent with a msst(5) receptor-mediated effect although apparent potency in the luciferase assay was much reduced compared to radioligand binding data. Octreotide = SRIE28> rCST-14= SRIF-14= CGP-23996. Octreotide, SRIF-28, BIM23052 and D Tyr Cyanamid 154806 behaved as full or nearly full agonists in comparison to SRIF-14, whereas the other compounds had relative efficacies of 40 to 70%. The present study shows that agonists radioligands define apparently different receptor populations in terms of number of sites and pharmacological profile in cells expressing a single recombinant receptor. These variations suggest that the conformation of the ligand receptor complex may vary depending on the agonist. Further, the msst(5) receptor, although primarily coupled to Gi/Go proteins, is able to stimulate luciferase gene expression driven by the serum responsive element. Finally, it is suggested that putative sst(2) selective agonists e.g. octreotide, RC160 or BIM23027 show similar or higher potency at msst(5) receptors than SRIF-14. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

They harbour a dense rim of activated innate immune cells at the lesion edge, which promotes lesion growth and thereby induces damage. Conventional MRI is of limited help in identifying the chronic active lesions, so alternative imaging modalities are needed. Objectives were to develop a PET-based automated analysis method for phenotyping of chronic lesions based on lesion-associated innate immune cell activation and to comprehensively evaluate the prevalence of these lesions in the various clinical subtypes of multiple sclerosis, and their association with disability. In this work, we use 18 kDa translocator protein-PET imaging for phenotyping chronic multiple sclerosis lesions at a large scale. For this, we identified 1510 white matter T1-hypointense lesions from 91 multiple sclerosis patients (67 relapsing-remitting patients and 24 secondary progressive patients). Innate immune cell activation at the lesion rim was measured using PET imaging and the 18 kDa translocator protein-binding radioligand C-11-PK11195. A T1-hypointense lesion was classified as rim-active if the distribution volume ratio of C-11-PK11195-binding was low in the plaque core and considerably higher at the plaque edge. If no significant ligand binding was observed, the lesion was classified as inactive. Plaques that had considerable ligand binding both in the core and at the rim were classified as overall-active. Conventional MRI and disability assessment using the Expanded Disability Status Scale were performed at the time of PET imaging. In the secondary progressive cohort, an average of 19% (median, interquartile range: 11-26) of T1 lesions were rim-active in each individual patient, compared to 10% (interquartile range: 0-20) among relapsing-remitting patients (P = 0.009). Secondary progressive patients had a median of 3 (range: 0-11) rim-active lesions, versus 1 (range: 0-18) among relapsing-remitting patients (P = 0.029). Among those patients who had rim-active lesions (n = 63), the average number of active voxels at the rim was higher among secondary progressive compared to relapsing-remitting patients (median 158 versus 74; P = 0.022). The number of active voxels at the rim correlated significantly with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (R = 0.43, P < 0.001), and the volume of the rim-active lesions similarly correlated with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (R = 0.45, P < 0.001). Our study is the first to report in vivo phenotyping of chronic lesions at large scale, based on 18 kDa translocator protein-PET. Patients with higher disability displayed a higher proportion of rim-active lesions. The in vivo lesion phenotyping methodology offers a new tool for individual assessment of smouldering (rim-active) lesion burden. This study describes in vivo phenotyping of multiple sclerosis lesions using translocator protein-PET. Nylund et al. report that secondary progressive multiple sclerosis patients displayed high proportion of rim-active lesions, indicating greater innate immune cell activation at the chronic lesion edge. The methodology offers a new tool for individual assessment of smouldering multiple sclerosis lesion burden.

Mangifera indica leaf extract (MLE) had previously been demonstrated to alter brain electrical activity in-vivo. The aim of the present series of studies was to investigate whether mangiferin, a major compound in leaves and in MLE, is responsible for the neurocognitive activity of MLE, and if the CNS activities of MLE have translational potential. Materials and methods: MLE, tradename Zynamite, is produced by Nektium Pharma, Spain. Isolated mangiferin was tested in-vitro in radioligand binding and enzyme inhibition studies against 106 CNS targets. Changes in the electroencephalograms (EEG's) of MLE and mangiferin were recorded in-vivo from four brain regions. Two double blind randomized placebo-controlled crossover clinical trials were conducted, each with 16 subjects. At 90 min and at 60 min respectively, after oral intake of 500 mg MLE, EEG recordings, psychometric tests, mood state, and tolerability were studied. Results: Isolated mangiferin is a selective inhibitor of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) with an IC50 of 1.1 mu M, with no activity on the CNS targets of caffeine. Both mangiferin and MLE induce similar changes in longterm potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus in-vitro, and induce a similar pattern of EEG changes in-vivo. In both translational clinical trials MLE was well tolerated, with no cardiovascular side-effects. In both studies MLE caused significant spectral changes in brain electrical activity in cortical regions during cognitive challenges, different to the attenuated spectral changes induced by caffeine. There were no significant changes in the psychometric tests other than reaction time for all groups. In the second study there was a trend to faster reaction time within group for MLE (p = 0.066) and the percentage improvement in reaction time for MLE compared to placebo was significant (p = 0.049). In the first study MLE improved all scores for Profile of Mood States (POMS), with the score for "fatigue" significantly improved (p = 0.015); in the second study the POMS score for "dejection" was improved in the caffeine group, p = 0.05. Conclusions: Mangiferin is a COMT inhibitor of moderate potency and is the major CNS-active compound in MLE. Both mangiferin and MLE increase hippocampal LTP in-vitro, and induce a similar pattern of changes in brain electrical activity in-vivo. While the translational clinical trials of MLE are limited by being single dose studies in a small number of subjects, they provide the first clinical evidence that the extract is well tolerated with no cardiovascular sideeffects, can induce changes in brain electrical activity, may give a faster reaction time, and decrease fatigue. These CNS activities support the reported folk-uses use of mango leaf tea as a substitute for tea and as a traditional remedy for fatigue and exhaustion. Extract Mangifera indica L., Zynamite, has nootropic potential, and larger clinical studies are needed to realise this potential.

Recently, the involvement of RIPK1 in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been reported; RIPK1 is involved in microglia's phenotypic transition to their dysfunctional states, and it is highly expressed in the neurons and microglia in the postmortem brains in AD patients. They prompt neurodegeneration leading to accumulations of pathological proteins in AD. Therefore, regulation of RIPK1 could be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of AD, and in vivo imaging of RIPK1 may become a useful modality in studies of drug discovery and pathophysiology of AD. The purpose of this study was to develop a suitable radioligand for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of RIPK1. Results: (S)-2,2-dimethyl-1-(5-phenyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)propan-1-one (GSK'963) has a high affinity, selectivity for RIPK1, and favorable physiochemical properties based on its chemical structure. In this study, since C-11-labeling (half-life: 20.4 min) GSK'963 retaining its structure requiring the Grignard reaction of tert-butylmagnesium halides and [C-11]carbon dioxide was anticipated to give a low yield, we decided instead to C-11-label a GSK'963 analog ((S)-2,2-dimethyl-1-(5-(m-tolyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)propan-1-one, GG502), which has a high RIPK1 inhibitory activity equivalent to that of the original compound GSK'963. Thus, we successfully C-11-labeled GG502 using a Pd-mediated cross-coupling reaction in favorable yields (3.6 +/- 1.9%) and radiochemical purities (> 96%), and molar activity (47-115 GBq/mu mol). On autoradiography, radioactivity accumulation was observed for [C-11]GG502 and decreased by non-radioactive GG502 in the mouse spleen and human brain, indicating the possibility of specific binding of this ligand to RIPK1. On brain PET imaging in a rhesus monkey, [C-11]GG502 showed a good brain permeability (peak standardized uptake value (SUV) similar to 3.0), although there was no clear evidence of specific binding of [C-11]GG502. On brain PET imaging in acute inflammation model rats, [C-11]GG502 also showed a good brain permeability, and no significant increased uptake was observed in the lipopolysaccharide-treated side of striatum. On metabolite analysis in rats at 30 min after administration of [C-11]GG502, similar to 55% and similar to 10% of radioactivity was from unmetabolized [C-11]GG502 in the brain and the plasma, respectively. Conclusions: We synthesized and evaluated a C-11-labeled PET ligand based on the methylated analog of GSK'963 for imaging of RIPK1 in the brain. Although in autoradiography of the resulting [C-11]GG502 indicated the possibility of specific binding, the actual PET imaging failed to detect any evidence of specific binding to RIPK1 despite its good brain permeability. Further development of radioligands with a higher binding affinity for RIPK1 in vivo and more stable metabolite profiles compared with the current compound may be required.

Quantification methods were determined from test/retest studies, and sensitivity to pharmacological blockade was tested with different doses of atomoxetine (ATX), a drug that binds to the NET with high affinity (K-i=2-5 nM). Methods: Twenty-four male subjects were divided into different groups for serial 90-min PET studies with [C-11](S,S)-MRB to assess reproducibility and the effect of blocking with different doses of ATX (25, 50 and 100 mg, po). Region-of-interest uptake data and arterial plasma input were analyzed for the distribution volume (DV). Images were normalized to a template, and average parametric images for each group were formed. Results: [C-11](S,S)-MRB uptake was highest in the thalamus (THL) and the midbrain (MBR) [containing the locus coeruleus (LC)] and lowest for the caudate nucleus (CDT). The CDT, a region with low NET, showed the smallest change on ATX treatment and was used as a reference region for the DV ratio (DVR). The baseline average DVR was 1.48 for both the THL and MBR with lower values for other regions [cerebellum (CB), 1.09; cingulate gyrus (CNG) 1.07]. However, more accurate information about relative densities came from the blocking studies. MBR exhibited greater blocking than THL, indicating a transporter density similar to 40% greater than THL. No relationship was found between DVR change and plasma ATX level. Although the higher dose tended to induce a greater decrease than the lower dose for MBR (average decrease for 25 mg=24 +/- 7%; 100 mg=31 +/- 11%), these differences were not significant. The different blocking between MBR (average decrease=28 +/- 10%) and THL (average decrease= 1 +/- 7 : 10%) given the same baseline DVR indicates that the CDT is not a good measure for non-NET binding in both regions. Threshold analysis of the difference between the average baseline DV image and the average blocked image showed the expected NET distribution with the MBR (LC) and hypothalamus > THL > CNG and CB, as well as a significant change in the supplementary motor area. DVR reproducibility for the different brain regions was similar to 10%, but intersubject variability was large. Conclusions: The highest density of NETs was found in the MBR where the LC is located, followed by THL, whereas the lowest density was found in basal ganglia (lowest in CDT), consistent with the regional localization of NETs in the nonhuman primate brain. While all three doses of ATX were found to block most regions, no significant differences between doses were found for any region, although the average percent change across subjects of the MBR did correlate with ATX dose. The lack of a dose effect could reflect a low signal-to-noise ratio coupled with the possibility that a sufficient number of transporters were blocked at the lowest dose and further differences could not be detected. However, since the lowest (25 mg) dose is less than the therapeutic doses used in children for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder(similar to 1.0 mg/kg/day), this would suggest that there may be additional targets for ATX's therapeutic actions.

Methods: PETimaging was performed with the NIH ATLAS small animal scanner in six elderly transgenic mice (Tg2576; age 22.0 +/- 1.8 months; 23.6 +/- 2.6 g) overexpressing a mutated form of human beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) known to result in the production of A beta plaques, and in six elderly wild-type litter mates ( age 21.8 +/- 1.6 months; 29.5 +/- 4.7 g). Dynamic PET scans were performed for 30 min in each mouse under 1% isoflurane inhalation anesthesia after a bolus injection of 13 - 46 MBq of [C-11] 6-OH-BTA-1. PET data were reconstructed with 3D OSEM. On the coronal PET image, irregular regions of interest (ROIs) were placed on frontal cortex (FR), parietal cortex (PA), striatum (ST), thalamus (TH), pons ( PO), and cerebellum (CE), guided by a mouse stereotaxic atlas. Time - activity curves (TACs) ( expressed as percent injected dose per gram normalized to body weight: % ID-kg/g) were obtained for FR, PA, ST, TH, PO, and CE. ROI-to-CE radioactivity ratios were also calculated. Following PET scans, sections of mouse brain prepared from anesthetized and fixative-perfused mice were stained with thioflavin-S. Results: TACs for [C-11] 6-OH-BTA-1 in all ROIs peaked early ( at 30 - 55 s), with radioactivity washing out quickly thereafter in both transgenic and wild-type mice. Peak uptake in all regions was significantly lower in transgenic mice than in wild-type mice. During the later part of the washout phase ( 12 - 30 min), the mean FR/CE and PA/CE ratios were higher in transgenic than in wild-type mice ( 1.06 +/- 0.04 vs 0.98 +/- 0.07, p= 0.04; 1.06 +/- 0.09 vs 0.93 +/- 0.08 p= 0.02) while ST/CE, TH/CE, and PO/CE ratios were not. Ex vivo staining revealed widespread A beta plaques in cortex, but not in cerebellum of transgenic mice or in any brain regions of wild-type mice. Conclusion: Marked reductions in brain uptake of this radioligand in transgenic mice may be due to reduced cerebral blood flow relative to that in wild-type mice. Specific [C-11] 6-OH-BTA-1 binding to A beta plaques, if any, is probably very low, as reflected in the small FR/CE and PA/CE ratio differences. FR/CE and PA/CE ratios are considerably higher in AD patients while A beta plaque densities in 22-month-old transgenic mice may be expected to show essentially the same density as is observed in the AD brain. This implies that the absence of tracer retention in 22-month-old transgenic mice may be due to the smaller number of A beta plaque binding sites and/or to lower affinity of the binding sites for [C-11] 6-OH-BTA-1 as compared with AD patients. [C-11] 6-OH-BTA-1 shows excellent brain uptake in mice.

Approaches to Improve the Pharmacokinetics of Radiolabeled Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Ligands Using Antagonistic Tracers	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						GLP-1 receptor; insulinoma; beta-cell mass; antagonist	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; PROSTATE-CANCER; GLP-1; PET; INSULINOMA; EXENDIN-4; THERAPY; METABOLISM; EXPRESSION; ANALOGS	The glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptors are important biomarkers for imaging pancreatic beta-cell mass and detection of benign insulinomas. Using GLP-1 receptor antagonists, we aimed to eliminate the insulin-related side effects reported for all GLP-1 receptor agonists. Additionally, using a nonresidualizing tracer, I-125-Bolton-Hunter-Exendin(9-39) NH2 (I-125-BH-Ex(9-39) NH2), we aimed to reduce the high kidney uptake, enabling a better detection of insulinomas in the tail and head of the pancreas. Methods: The affinity and biodistribution of Ex(9-39) NH2-based antagonists, modified with DOTA or NODAGA chelators at positions Lys(27) and Lys(40) and labeled with Ga-68 and I-125-BH-Ex(9-39) NH2, were compared with the reference GLP-1 receptor agonist [Nle(14), Lys(40)(Ahx-DOTA-Ga-68) NH2]Ex-4. The inhibitory concentration of 50% (IC50) values were determined using autoradiography on human tissues with I-125-GLP-1(7-36)NH2 as a radioligand. Pharmacokinetics and PET imaging were studied in nude mice bearing rat Ins-1E tumors. Results: Conjugation of DOTA and NODAGA chelators at positions Lys(27) and Lys(40) of Ex(9-39)NH2 resulted in a distinct loss of affinity toward GLP-1 receptor in vitro. Among the studied antagonists, [Lys(40)(NODAGA-natGa)NH2] Ex(9-39) showed the lowest IC50 value (46.7 +/- 16.3 nM). The reference agonist [Nle(14), Lys(40)(Ahx-DOTA)NH2]Ex-4 demonstrated the highest affinity (IC50 = 0.9 +/- 0.3 nM). Biodistribution of [Nle(14), Lys(40)(Ahx-DOTA- Ga-68)NH2] Ex-4 at 1 h after injection demonstrated 40.2 +/- 8.2 percentage injected activity per gram (%IA/g) uptake in Ins-1E tumor, 12.5 +/- 2.2 % IA/g in the pancreas, and 235.8 +/- 17.0 % IA/g in the kidney, with tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-kidney ratios of 100.52 and 0.17, respectively. Biodistribution of [Lys(40)(NODAGA-68Ga)NH2] Ex(9-39) showed only 2.2 +/- 0.2 %IA/g uptake in Ins-1E tumor, 1.0 +/- 0.1 % IA/g in the pancreas, and 78.4 +/- 8.5 % IA/g in the kidney at 1 h after injection, with tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-kidney ratios of 7.33 and 0.03, respectively. In contrast, I-125-BH-Ex(9-39)NH2 showed tumor uptake (42.5 +/- 8.1 % IA/g) comparable to the agonist and 28.8 +/- 5.1 % IA/g in the pancreas at 1 h after injection. As we hypothesized, the kidney uptake of I-125-BH-Ex(9-39)NH2 was low, only 12.1 +/- 1.4 % IA/g at 1 h after injection. The tumor-to-kidney ratio of I-125-BH-Ex(9-39)NH2 was improved 20-fold. Conclusion: Our results suggest that iodinated Ex(9-39)NH2 may be a promising tracer for imaging GLP-1 receptor expression in vivo. Because of the 20-fold improved tumorto- kidney ratio I-125-BH-Ex(9-39)NH2 may offer higher sensitivity in the detection of insulinomas and imaging of beta-cell mass in diabetic patients. Further studies with I-124-BH-Ex(9-39)NH2 are warranted.

Radiation Nanomedicine for EGFR-Positive Breast Cancer: Panitumumab-Modified Gold Nanoparticles Complexed to the β-Particle-Emitter, <SUP>177</SUP>Lu	MOLECULAR PHARMACEUTICS			English	Article						gold nanoparticles; lutetium-177; panitumumab; epidermal growth factor receptor; breast cancer	RADIOTHERAPY; CELLS; RADIOSENSITIZATION; CHEMOTHERAPY; SURVIVAL; THERAPY; ENHANCE; IN-111; SYSTEM; SIZE	Our objective was to construct a novel radiation nanomedicine for treatment of breast cancer (BC) expressing epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR), particularly triple-negative tumors (TNBC). Gold nanoparticles (AuNP; 30 nm) were modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains (4 kDa) derivatized with 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) chelators for complexing the beta-emitter, Lu-177 and with PEG chains (5 kDa) linked to panitumumab for targeting BC cells expressing EGFR. The AuNP were further coated with PEG chains (2 kDa) to stabilize the particles to aggregation. The binding and internalization of EGFR-targeted AuNP (Lu-177-T-AuNP) into BC cells was studied and compared to nontargeted Lu-177-NT-AuNP. The cytotoxicity of Lu-177-T-AuNP and Lu-177-NT-AuNP was measured in clonogenic assays using BC cells with widely different EGFR densities: MDA-MB-468 (10(6) receptors/cell), MDA-MB-231 (10(5) receptors/cell), and MCF-7 cells (10(4) receptors/cell). Radiation absorbed doses to the cell nucleus of MDA-MB-468 cells were estimated based on subcellular distribution. Darkfield and fluorescence microscopy as well as radioligand binding assays revealed that Lu-177-T-AuNP were specifically bound by BC cells dependent on their EGFR density whereas the binding and internalization of Lu-177-NT-AuNP was significantly lower. The affinity of binding of Lu-177-T-AuNP to MDA-MB-468 cells was reduced by 2-fold compared to I-123-labeled panitumumab (K-D = 1.3 +/- 0.2 nM vs 0.7 +/- 0.4 nM, respectively). The cytotoxicity of Lu-177-T-AuNP was dependent on the amount of radioactivity incubated with BC cells, their EGFR density and the radiosensitivity of the cells. The clonogenic survival (CS) of MDA-MB-468 cells overexpressing EGFR was reduced to <0.001% at the highest amount of Lu-177-T-AuNP tested (4.5 MBq; 6 X 10(11) AuNP per 2.5 X 10(4)-1.2 X 10(5) cells). Lu-177-T-AuNP were less effective for killing MDA-MB-231 cells or MCF-7 cells with moderate or low EGFR density (CS = 33.8 +/- 1.6% and 25.8 +/- 1.2%, respectively). Because the particles emitted by Lu-177 have a 2 mm range, Lu-177-NT-AuNP were also cytotoxic to BC cells due to a cross-fire effect but Lu-177-T-AuNP were significantly more potent for killing MDA-MB-468 cells overexpressing EGFR than Lu-177-NT-AuNP at all amounts tested. The cross-fire effect of the beta-particles emitted by Lu-177 may be valuable for eradicating BC cells in tumors that have low or moderate EGFR expression or cells that are not targeted by Lu-177-T-AuNP as a consequence of heterogeneous intratumoral distribution. The radiation dose to the nucleus of a single MDA-MB-468 cell was 73.2 +/- 6.7 Gy, whereas Lu-177-NT-AuNP delivered 5.6 +/- 0.6 Gy. We conclude that Lu-177-T-AuNP is a promising novel radiation nanomedicine with potential application for treatment of TNBC, in which EGFR are often overexpressed.

Such tumors are often resistant to hormone therapy. Despite a general inverse association between HER-2/neu amplification/overexpression and estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR) expression, a fraction of patients are both HER-2/neu- and hormone receptor (HR)-positive. The efficacy of hormone therapy in this group is currently a matter of debate. To better understand the relationship between HER-2/neu positivity and HR expression, we analyzed HER-2/neu, ER, and PR as continuous variables in breast cancer cell lines and two cohorts of primary breast cancer patients. Methods: HER-2/neu and ER/PR expression was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and enzyme immunoassay (EIA), respectively, in 14 human breast cancer cell lines, some of which had been transfected with the HER-2/neu gene. For the clinical study population, HER-2/neu protein levels were assessed by ELISA (cohort A, n = 665), and HER-2/neu gene copy number was determined using fluorescence in situ hybridization (cohort B, n = 894). ER/PR expression was analyzed by EIA (cohort A) or radioligand binding (cohort B). Associations between HER-2/neu and ER/PR expression were analyzed using Spearman's rho correlation and the chi-square test, and absolute levels were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: HR-positive human breast cancer cell lines transfected with the HER-2/neu gene expressed statistically significantly lower levels of ER and PR than parental lines. In the clinical cohorts, levels of HER-2/neu overexpression and gene amplification were inversely correlated with ER/PR levels (Cohort A [n = 112]: for ER, r = -0.34, P<.001; for PR, r = -0.24, P =.010. Cohort B [n = 188]: for ER, r = -0.39 P<001; for PR, r = -0.26, P<.001). Among patients with HR-positive tumors, HER-2/neu-positive tumors had statistically significantly lower ER/PR levels than HER-2/neu-negative ones (Cohort A: for ER, median = 25 fmol/mg [interquartile range {IQR} = 13-781 versus median = 38.5 fmol/mg [IQR 17-99] and P =.031; for PR, median = 35 fmol/mg [IQR 12-119] versus median = 88.5 fmol/mg [IQR = 22-236] and P<.001. Cohort B: for ER, median = 44 fmol/mg [IQR = 13-156] versus median = 92 fmol/mg [IQR = 35-235] and P<.001; for PR, median = 36 fmol/mg [IQR = 13-108] versus median = 84 fmol/mg [IQR = 24-250] and P<.001). Patients with higher levels of HER-2/neu overexpression or amplification had statistically significantly lower levels of ER/PR than patients with lower levels of HER-2/neu overexpression or amplification. Conclusion: Because absolute HR levels are strongly related to response to hormone therapy in primary and advanced breast cancer, reduced ER/PR expression may be one mechanism to explain the relative resistance of HER-2/neu-positive:HR-positive tumors to hormone therapy.

Amino acid cocktail infusion has been applied to reduce renal absorbed dose by inhibiting the proximal tubular reabsorption of the radiopeptide. An Evans blue-modified Lu-177-labeled octreotate (Lu-177-DOTA-EB-TATE) has an extended circulation in the blood, which may make the amino acid infusion unnecessary. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety, biodistribution, and dosimetry of Lu-177-DOTA-EB-TATE with and without amino acid infusion.Patients and MethodsTen patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors were randomly divided into 2 groups. The effect of amino acid infusion on renal uptake was assessed in a crossover randomized setting. Group A received Lu-177-DOTA-EB-TATE at a dose of 3.7 GBq without amino acid infusion for the first cycle and with amino acid infusion for the second cycle; group B received Lu-177-DOTA-EB-TATE at a dose of 3.7 GBq with amino acid infusion for the first cycle and without amino acid infusion for the second cycle. All patients underwent serial whole-body planar imaging at 1, 24, 96, and 168 hours and SPECT scan at 24 hours after radioligand administration. Abdominal CT was performed 2 days before PRRT for SPECT/CT fusion. The dosimetry was calculated using the HERMES software. Dosimetry evaluation was compared on a between-group and intrapatient basis.ResultsAdministrations of Lu-177-DOTA-EB-TATE with or without amino acids were well tolerated. No grade 4 hematotoxicity was observed in any of the patients. Grade 3 thrombocytopenia was reported in 1 patient. No nephrotoxicity of any grade was recorded. No significant difference was observed in creatinine (75.1 +/- 21.7 vs 67.5 +/- 18.1 mu mol/L, P = 0.128), blood urea nitrogen (4.5 +/- 0.8 vs 5.1 +/- 1.4 mmol/L, P = 0.612), or GFR (109.3 +/- 25.2 vs 100.9 +/- 24.9 mL/min, P = 0.398) before and after PRRT. For each cycle, there was no significant difference in whole-body effective dose, kidney effective dose, as well as residence time of the kidneys between group A and B (P > 0.05). By intrapatient comparison, without and with amino acid infusion also did not show significant difference in whole-body effective dose (0.14 +/- 0.05 vs 0.12 +/- 0.04 mSv/MBq, P = 0.612), kidney effective dose (1.09 +/- 0.42 vs 0.73 +/- 0.31 mSv/MBq, P = 0.093), and residence time of the kidneys (2.95 +/- 1.58 vs 3.13 +/- 1.11 hours, P = 0.674).Conclusions(177)Lu-DOTA-EB-TATE PRRT with and without amino acid infusion demonstrated a favorable safety profile in neuroendocrine tumor patients. Administration of Lu-177-DOTA-EB-TATE without amino acid infusion has acceptable slightly increased kidney absorbed dose and residence time of the kidneys, and does not affect kidney function. Further investigation in a larger cohort and long-term follow-up are warranted.

However, retesting for oestrogen receptor status with rebiopsy is not always feasible, depending on lesion location and the risk associated with biopsy, and in these cases clinicians continue to treat patients according to the oestrogen receptor status of the primary tumour. Consequently suboptimal therapy might be offered to these patients. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy and safety of 16 alpha-[F-18]fluoro-17 beta-oestradiol (F-18-FES) PET-CT to assess oestrogen receptor status in patients with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. Methods We did a prospective cohort study at the Asan Medical Center, Seoul, South Korea. Eligible patients had breast cancer, with first recurrence or metastatic disease at presentation, were 19 years or older, and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2. The primary objective was to show the agreement between qualitative F-18-FES PET-CT interpretation and the results of oestrogen receptor expression by immunohistochemical assay, a non-reference standard test. Whole-body F-18-FES PET-CT imaging was done after intravenous injection of 111-222 MBq of 18 F-FES, with dosing primarily determined by radiation dosimetry analysis. F-18-FES uptake above background intensity was interpreted as positive. Efficacy was assessed in all patients with histologically confirmed recurrent or metastatic breast cancer who received F-18-FES and had PET-CT images available (intention-to-diagnose analysis), and safety was assessed in all patients who received F-18-FES. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01986569. Findings Between Nov 27,2013, and Nov 10,2016,93 patients were enrolled. Of the 85 patients included in the efficacy analysis, 47 (55%) were oestrogen receptor-positive and 38 (45%) were oestrogen receptor-negative. Positive status percent agreement between the F-18-FES PET-CT results and oestrogen receptor status by immunohistochemical assay was 76.6% (95% CI 62.0-87.7) and the negative status percent agreement was 100.0% (90.8-100.0). Patients who were oestrogen receptor-positive and had a positive F-18-FES PET-CT result had a significantly higher progesterone receptor expression than those who were oestrogen receptor-positive and had a negative F-18-FES PET-CT result (23 [68%] of 34 patients vs 0 of 11 patients; p<0.0001). The most common adverse event was procedural pain in nine (10%) of 90 patients injected with F-18-FES. No adverse events were related to the study drug except injection site pain in one (1%) patient. No serious adverse events were recorded. Interpretation The high negative percent agreement between F-18-FES PET-CT and oestrogen receptor status by immunohistochemical assay in this cohort suggests that positive F-18-FES uptake by recurrent or metastatic oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer lesions could be an alternative to oestrogen receptor assays in this setting. Staging assessment should include F-18-FES PET-CT when retesting oestrogen receptor status is not feasible. Copyright (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, a number of limitations complicate the routine use of IDIFs in clinical research protocols and the full substitution of manual arterial samples by venous ones has hardly been evaluated. This study aims for a direct validation of IDIFs and venous data for the quantification of serotonin-1A receptor binding (5-HT1A) with [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635 before and after hormone treatment. Methods: Fifteen PET measurements with arterial and venous blood sampling were obtained from 10 healthy women, 8 scans before and 7 after eight weeks of hormone replacement therapy. Image-derived input functions were derived automatically from cerebral blood vessels, corrected for partial volume effects and combined with venous manual samples from 10 min onward (IDIF + VIF). Corrections for plasma/whole-blood ratio and metabolites were done separately with arterial and venous samples. 5-HT1A receptor quantification was achieved with arterial input functions (AIF) and IDIF + VIF using a two-tissue compartment model. Results: Comparison between arterial and venous manual blood samples yielded excellent reproducibility. Variability (VAR) was less than 10% for whole-blood activity (p > 0.4) and below 2% for plasma to whole-blood ratios (p > 0.4). Variability was slightly higher for parent fractions (VARmax = 24% at 5 min, p < 0.05 and VAR < 13% after 20 min, p > 0.1) but still within previously reported values. IDIFs after partial volume correction had peak values comparable to AIFs (mean difference Delta = -7.6 +/- 16.9 kBq/ml, p > 0.1), whereas AIFs exhibited a delay (Delta = 4 +/- 6.4s, p < 0.05) and higher peak width (Delta = 15.9 +/- 5.2 s, p < 0.001). Linear regression analysis showed strong agreement for 5-HT1A binding as obtained with AIF and IDIF + VIF at baseline (R-2 = 0.95), after treatment (R-2 = 0.93) and when pooling all scans (R-2 = 0.93), with slopes and intercepts in the range of 0.97 to 1.07 and -0.05 to 0.16, respectively. In addition to the region of interest analysis, the approach yielded virtually identical results for voxel-wise quantification as compared to the AIF. Conclusions: Despite the fast metabolism of the radioligand, manual arterial blood samples can be substituted by venous ones for parent fractions and plasma to whole-blood ratios. Moreover, the combination of image-derived and venous input functions provides a reliable quantification of 5-HT1A receptors. This holds true for 5-HT1A binding estimates before and after treatment for both regions of interest-based and voxel-wise modeling. Taken together, the approach provides less invasive receptor quantification by full independence of arterial cannulation. This offers great potential for the routine use in clinical research protocols and encourages further investigation for other radioligands with different kinetic characteristics.

Lutetium-177 [Lu-177]-PSMA-617, a radiolabelled small molecule, binds with high affinity to prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) enabling beta particle therapy targeted to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. We aimed to investigate the safety, efficacy, and effect on quality of life of [Lu-177]-PSMA-617 in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who progressed after standard treatments. Methods In this single-arm, single-centre, phase 2 trial, we recruited men (aged 18 years and older) with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and progressive disease after standard treatments, including taxane-based chemotherapy and second-generation anti-androgens, from the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VIC, Australia. Patients underwent a screening PSMA and FDG-PET/CT to confirm high PSMA-expression. Eligible patients had progressive disease defined by imaging (according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours [RECIST] or bone scan) or new pain in an area of radiographically evident disease, and were required to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 2 or lower. Eligible patients received up to four cycles of intravenous [Lu-177]-PSMA-617, at six weekly intervals. The primary endpoint was PSA response according to Prostate Cancer Clinical Trial Working Group criteria defined as a greater than 50% PSA decline from baseline and toxicity according to CTCAE. Additional primary endpoints were imaging responses (as measured by bone scan, CT, PSMA, and FDG PET/CT) and quality of life (assessed with the EORTC-Q30 and Brief Pain InventoryShort Form questionnaires), all measured up to 3 months post completion of treatment. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number 12615000912583. Findings Between Aug 26, 2015, and Dec 8, 2016, 43 men were screened to identify 30 patients eligible for treatment. 26 (87%) had received at least one line of previous chemotherapy (80% docetaxel and 47% cabazitaxel) and 25 (83%) received prior abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, or both. The mean administered radioactivity was 7.5 GBq per cycle. 17 (57%) of 30 patients (95% CI 37-75) achieved a PSA decline of 50% or more. There were no treatmentrelated deaths. The most common toxic effects related to [Lu-177]-PSMA-617 were grade 1dry mouth recorded in 26 (87%) patients, grade 1 and 2 transient nausea in 15 (50%), and G1-2 fatigue in 15 (50%). Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia possibly attributed to [Lu-177]-PSMA-617 occurred in four (13%) patients. Objective response in nodal or visceral disease was reported in 14 (82%) of 17 patients with measurable disease. Clinically meaningful improvements in pain severity and interference scores were recorded at all timepoints. 11(37%) patients experienced a ten point or more improvement in global health score by the second cycle of treatment. Interpretation Our findings show that radionuclide treatment with [Lu-177]-PSMA-617 has high response rates, low toxic effects, and reduction of pain in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who have progressed after conventional treatments. This evidence supports the need for randomised controlled trials to further assess efficacy compared with current standards of care. Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

CNS DRUGS			English	Article							II TYPE-2 RECEPTOR; ACTIVATED PROTEIN-KINASE; PC12W CELLS; BLOOD-PRESSURE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; CULTURED NEURONS; AT(1) RECEPTORS; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; FETAL TISSUES; OPTIC-NERVE	In addition to the systemic renin-angiotensin system (RAS), a local RAS has been identified. Recent research has focused on this latter system and has investigated the effects of locally generated angiotensin II, especially in the kidney, heart and CNS. In the mammalian brain, all components of the RAS are present including angiotensin AT(1) and AT(2) receptor subtypes. While the AT(1) receptor is responsible for the classical effects of angiotensin II, it has been found that the AT(2) receptor displays totally different signalling mechanisms and this has revealed hitherto unknown functions of angiotensin II. AT(2) receptors are expressed at low density in many healthy adult tissues, but are up-regulated in pathological circumstances, e.g. stroke or nerve lesion. Evidence has now emerged that the actions of angiotensin II that are exerted via the AT(2) receptor are directly opposed to those mediated by the AT(1) receptor. For example, the AT(2) receptor has antiproliferative properties and therefore opposes the growth-promoting effect linked to AT(1) receptor stimulation. It has been reported that the AT(2) receptor regulates several functions of nerve cells, e.g. ionic fluxes, cell differentiation and axonal regeneration, but also modulates programmed cell death. It is possible that a more extensive knowledge of the AT(2) receptor could contribute to the understanding of the clinically beneficial effects of AT(1) receptor antagonists, as this treatment may, unmask. AT(2) receptor activity. This review presents selected aspects of advances in AT(2) receptor pharmacology, molecular biology and signal transduction with particular reference to possible novel therapeutic options for CNS diseases. Since the discovery of renin, one of the pivotal enzymes involved in the generation of the effector peptide angiotensin II by Tigerstedt and Bergtiiannl([1]) in 1898, the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been the subject of intense research. Over the years, it became evident that the RAS not only represents one of the phylogenetically oldest hormone systems to regulate cardiovascular function and volume homoeostasis, but also participates in numerous additional processes including cell proliferation and differentiation, inflammation and apoptosis. In 1989, radioligand binding studies with angiotensin II receptor ligands such as the imidazole acetic acid derivative losartan, the pseudopeptide CGP 42112A and non-peptidergic ligands (e.g. PD 123177 and PD 123319([2.3])) revealed the existence of at least two distinct angiotensin II binding sites, which were subsequently classified as angiotensin AT, and AT, receptors.([4]) Whereas most of the known physiological and pathophysiological effects of angiotensin II (e.g. vasoconstriction, aldosterone release, renal sodium reabsorption and central osmoregulatory actions), as well as vascular cell proliferation and hypertrophy, were soon attributed to the AT, receptor, the cellular and systemic functions of the AT(2) receptor remained enigmatic for years.([5]) In the last few years, a growing body of evidence has indicated that AT(2) receptors not only mediate a mere opposition of AT(1) receptor-related effects, but are also involved in biological programmes in the nervous system, such as the regulation of neuronal differentiation, apoptosis and axonal regeneration.([6]) This article will focus on recent findings regarding the AT(2) receptor as a potential target in the therapy of neurological diseases.

To meet the clinical need for a more cost-effective altemative, the PSMA-I&T-based tracer concept was adapted to Tc-99m-labeling chemistry. Two PSMA-I&T-derived inhibitors with all-L-serine- (MAS(3)) and all-D-serine- (mas(3)) chelating moieties were evaluated in parallel, and a kit procedure for routine Tc-99m labeling was developed. Methods: PSMA affinities (IC50) and internalization kinetics of Tc-99m-MASS-y-nal-k (Sub-KuE) and Tc-99m-mas(3)-y-nal-k(Sub-KuE) (Tc-99m-PSMA-I&S for imaging and surgery) were determined using LNCaP cells and (I-125-BA) KuE as a radioligand and reference standard. In vivo metabolite analyses and biodistribution studies were performed using CD-1 nu/nu and LNCaP tumor-bearing CB-17 severe combined immunodeficiency mice. The pharmacokinetics of Tc-99m-PSMA-I&S in humans were investigated in a patient with advanced metastatic PCa via sequential planar whole-body SPECT imaging at 1, 3, 5, and 21 h after injection. Additionally, preoperative SPECT/CT (12 h after injection) and Tc-99m-PSMA-I&S-supported RGS (16 h after injection) were performed in 1 PCa patient with proven iliac and inguinal lymph node metastases. Results: A robust and reliable kit-labeling procedure was established, allowing the preparation of Tc-99m-MAS(3)-y-nal-k(Sub-KuE) and Tc-99m-PSMA-I&S in consistently high radiochemical yield and purity (>= 98%, n > 50 preparations). Because of its improved internalization efficiency and superior in vivo stability, Tc-99m-PSMA-I&S was selected for further in vivo evaluation. Compared with In-111-PSMA-I&T, Tc-99m-PSMA-I&S showed delayed clearance kinetics but identical uptake in PSMA-positive tissues in the LNCaP xenograft model (1 h after injection). In exemplary PCa patients, a relatively slow whole-body clearance of Tc-99m-PSMA-I&S was observed due to high plasma protein binding (94%) of the tracer. This, however, promoted efficient tracer uptake in PCa lesions over time and led to steadily increasing lesion-to-background ratios up to 21 h after injection. Preoperative SPECT/CT showed a high Tc-99m-PSMA-I&S uptake in all suspect lesions identified in previous Ga-68-HBED-CC-Ahx-KuE (Ga-68-HBED-CC-PSMA) PET/CT, allowing for their successful intraoperative detection and resection during first-in-human RGS. Conclusion: Because of a straightforward and reliable kit production, Tc-99m-PSMA-I&S represents a cost-effective, readily available alternative to In-111-PSMA-I&T. Initial patient data indicate its comparable or even superior performance as a probe for PSMA-targeted RGS and also hint toward the unexpected potential of Tc-99m-PSMA-I&S as a SPECT imaging agent.

The affinity of analogues was determined in a radioligand binding assay using cloned human mt(1) and MT2 receptor subtypes expressed in NIH 3T3 cells. Agonist and antagonist potency was measured using the pigment aggregation response of a clonal line of Xenopus laevis melanophores. The 2-methoxyisoindolo[2,1-a]indoles (7a-d) showed much higher binding affinities than the parent isoindoles (5a-e), and whereas 7a-c were agonists in the functional assay, 7d and 5a-e were antagonists. The 2-ethoxyisoindolo[2,1-a]indoles (10a-d) showed reduced binding affinities compared to their methoxy analogues, while the 5-chloro derivative 13 showed a considerable reduction in binding affinity and potency compared to 7a. The 10-methoxy-5,6-dihydroindolo[2,1-a]isoquinolines (21a-c) had higher binding affinities than the corresponding parent indoloisoquinolines (20a-c) in the human receptor subtypes, and the parent compounds were antagonists whereas the 10-methoxy derivatives were agonists in the functional assay. The N-cyclobutanecarbonyl derivatives of both the parent (20d) and 10-methoxyl (21d) series had similar binding affinities and were both antagonists with similar potencies. The 11-methoxy-6,7-5H-benzo[c]azepino[2,1-a]indoles (25a-d) had higher binding affinities than the corresponding parent compounds (23a-d) at the MT2 receptor but similar affinities at the mt(1) site; all of the compounds were antagonists in the functional assay. Changing 11-methoxy for 11-ethoxy decreased the binding affinity slightly, and this was more evident at the MT2 receptor. All of the derivatives investigated had either the same or a greater affinity for the human MT2 receptor compared to the mt(1) receptor (range 1:1-1:132). This suggests that the mt(1) and MT2 receptor pockets differ in their ability to accommodate alkyl groups in the indole nitrogen region of the melatonin molecule. Two compounds (7c and 25c) were tested in functional assays on recombinant mt(1) and MT2 melatonin receptors. Compound 7c is a potent agonist with some selectivity (44-fold) for the MT2 receptor, while 25c is an MT2-preferring antagonist. Increasing the carbon chain length between N-1 of indole and the 2-phenyl group from n = 1 through n = 3 leads to a fairly regular decrease in the binding affinity, but, remarkably, when n = 3, it converts the methoxy compounds from melatonin agonists to antagonists. The Xenopus melatonin receptor thus cannot accommodate an N-n-alkyl chain attached to a 2-phenyl substituent with n > 2 in the required orientation to induce or stabilize the active receptor conformation.

Studies of the mechanisms of action of vanidipinedilol that combine these effects within a single molecule are described here. Intravenous injection of vanidipinedilol (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/kg) produced dose-dependent hypotensive and bradycardic responses, significantly different from nifedipine-induced (0.5 mg/kg, i.v.) hypotensive and reflex tachycardic effects in pentobarbital-anesthetized Wistar rats, A single oral administration of vanidipinedilol at doses of 10, 25, and 50 mg/kg dose-dependently reduced blood pressure with a decrease in heart rate in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). In the isolated Wistar rat atrium, vanidipinedilol (10(-7), 10(-6), and 10(-5) M) competitively antagonized the (-)isoproterenol-induced positive chronotropic and inotropic effects and inhibited the increase in heart rate induced by Ca2+ (3.0-9.0 mM) in a concentration-dependent manner. The parallel shift to the right of the concentration-response curve of (-)isoproterenol and CaCl2 suggested that vanidipinedilol possessed beta-adrenoceptor-blocking and calcium entry-blocking activities. On tracheal strips of reserpinized guinea pig, cumulative doses of vanidipinedilol (10(-10) to 3 x 10(-6) M) produced dose-dependent relaxant responses. Preincubating the preparation with ICI 118,551 (10(-10), 10(-9), 10(-8) M), a beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, shifted the vanidipinedilol concentration-relaxation curve significantly to a region of higher concentrations. These results implied that vanidipinedilol had a partial beta(2)-agonist activity. In the isolated thoracic aorta of rat, vanidipinedilol had a potent effect inhibiting high-K+-induced contractions. KCl-induced intracellular calcium changes of blood vessel smooth muscle cell (A7r5 cell Lines) determined by laser cytometry also was decreased after administration of vanidipinedilol (10(-8), 10(-7), 10(-6) M). Furthermore, the binding characteristics of vanidipinedilol and various antagonists were evaluated in [H-3]CGP-12177 binding to ventricle and lung and [H-3]nitrendipine binding to cerebral cortex membranes in rats. The order of potency of beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist activity against [H-3]CGP-12177 binding was (-)propranolol (pK(i), 8.59 for beta(1) and 8.09 for beta(2)) > vanidipinedilol (pK(i), 7.09 for beta(1) and 6.64 for beta(2)) > atenolol (pK(i), 6.58 for beta(1) and 5.12 for beta(2)). The order of potency of calcium channel antagonist activity against [H-3]nitrendipine binding was nifedipine (pK(i), 9.36) > vanidipinedilol (pK(i) 8.07). The ratio of beta(1)-adrenergic-blocking/ calcium entry-blocking selectivity is 0.1 and indicated that vanidipinedilol revealed more in calcium entry-blocking than in beta-adrenergic-blocking activities. It has been suggested that vanidipinedilol-induced smooth muscle relaxation may involve decreased entry of Ca2+ and partial beta(2)-agonist activities. In conclusion, vanidipinedilol is a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with calcium channel blocking and partial beta(2)-agonist associated vasorelaxant and tracheal relaxant activities. Particularly, the vasodilator effects of vanidipinedilol are attributed to a synergism of its calcium entry blocking and partial beta(2)-agonist activities in the blood vessel. A sustained bradycardic effect results from beta-adrenoceptor blocking and calcium entry blocking, which blunts the sympathetic activation-associated reflex tachycardia in the heart.

Association of translocator protein total distribution volume with duration of untreated major depressive disorder: a cross-sectional study	LANCET PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE; MICROGLIAL ACTIVATION; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; BRAIN; BINDING; INFLAMMATION; RADIOLIGAND; PET; RECEPTORS	Background People with major depressive disorder frequently exhibit increasing persistence of major depressive episodes. However, evidence for neuroprogression (ie, increasing brain pathology with longer duration of illness) is scarce. Microglial activation, which is an important component of neuroinflammation, is implicated in neuroprogression. We examined the relationship of translocator protein (TSPO) total distribution volume (V-T), a marker of microglial activation, with duration of untreated major depressive disorder, and with total illness duration and antidepressant exposure. Methods In this cross-sectional study, we recruited participants aged 18-75 years from the Toronto area and the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (Toronto, ON, Canada). Participants either had major depressive episodes secondary to major depressive disorder or were healthy, as confirmed with a structured clinical interview and consultation with a study psychiatrist. To be enrolled, participants with major depressive episodes had to score a minimum of 17 on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and had to be medication free or taking a stable dose of medication for at least 4 weeks before PET scanning. Eligible participants were non-smokers; had no history of or concurrent alcohol or substance dependence, neurological illness, autoimmune disorder, or severe medical problems; and were free from acute medical illnesses for the previous 2 weeks before PET scanning. Participants were excluded if they had used brain stimulation treatments within the 6 months before scanning, had used anti-inflammatory drugs lasting at least 1 week within the past month, were taking hormone replacement therapy, had psychotic symptoms, had bipolar disorder (type I or II) or borderline antisocial personality disorder, or were pregnant or breastfeeding. We scanned three primary grey-matter regions of interest (prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and insula) and 12 additional regions and subregions using F-18-FEPPA PET to measure TSPO V-T. We investigated the duration of untreated major depressive disorder, and the combination of total duration of disease and duration of antidepressant treatment, as predictor variables of TSPO V-T, assessing their significance. Findings Between Sept 1, 2009, and July 6, 2017, we screened 134 participants for eligibility, of whom 81 were included in the study (current major depressive episode n=51, healthy n=30). We excluded one participant with a major depressive episode from the analysis because of unreliable information about previous medication use. Duration of untreated major depressive disorder was a strong predictor of TSPO V-T (p < 0.0001), as were total illness duration (p=0.0021) and duration of antidepressant exposure (p=0.037). The combination of these predictors accounted for about 50% of variance in TSPO V-T in the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and insula. In participants who had untreated major depressive disorder for 10 years or longer, TSPO V-T was 29-33% greater in the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and insula than in participants who were untreated for 9 years or less. TSPO V-T was also 31-39% greater in the three primary grey-matter regions of participants with long duration of untreated major depressive disorder compared with healthy participants (p=0.00047). Interpretation Microglial activation, as shown by TSPO V-T, is greater in patients with chronologically advanced major depressive disorder with long periods of no antidepressant treatment than in patients with major depressive disorder with short periods of no antidepressant treatment, which is strongly suggestive of a different illness phase. Consistent with this, the yearly increase in microglial activation is no longer evident when antidepressant treatment is given.

These theranostic agents are often developed by randomly conjugating radioisotopes/drugs/chelators to the primary amine of lysine or the sulfhydryl groups of cysteine on the antibody. Random conjugation often alters the properties of the antibody. We have site-specifically radiolabeled nimotuzumab an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody with 89Zr and 225Ac using SpyTag: increment N-SpyCatcher for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and alpha particle radiotherapy, and evaluated these agents in a model of EGFR-positive triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Nimotuzumab-SpyTag- increment N-SpyCatcher constructs showed improved binding in vitro compared with randomly conjugated constructs. 89Zr-nimotuzumab-SpyTag- increment N-SpyCatcher specifically delineated EGFR-positive xenograft in vivo using microPET/CT imaging. Compared with control treatment groups, 225Ac-nimotuzumab-SpyTag- increment N-SpyCatcher more than doubled the survival of mice bearing EGFR-positive MDA-MB-231 TNBC xenograft. This work highlights a facile method to site-specifically radiolabel antibodies using SpyTag: increment N-SpyCatcher. To develop imaging and therapeutic agents, antibodies are often conjugated randomly to a chelator/radioisotope or drug using a primary amine (NH2) of lysine or sulfhydryl (SH) of cysteine. Random conjugation to NH2 or SH groups can require extreme conditions and may affect target recognition/binding and must therefore be tested. In the present study, nimotuzumab was site-specifically labeled using increment N-SpyCatcher/SpyTag with different chelators and radiometals. Nimotuzumab is a well-tolerated anti-EGFR antibody with low skin toxicities. First, Delta N-SpyCatcher was reduced using tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), which was followed by desferoxamine-maleimide (DFO-mal) conjugation to yield a reactive Delta N-SpyCatcher-DFO. The Delta N-SpyCatcher-DFO was reacted with nimotuzumab-SpyTag to obtain stable nimotuzumab-SpyTag- increment N-SpyCatcher-DFO. Radiolabeling was performed with Zr-89, and the conjugate was used for the in vivo microPET imaging of EGFR-positive MDA-MB-468 xenografts. Similarly, increment N-SpyCatcher was conjugated to an eighteen-membered macrocyclic chelator macropa-maleimide and used to radiolabel nimotuzumab-SpyTag with actinium-225 (Ac-225) for in vivo radiotherapy studies. All constructs were characterized using biolayer interferometry, flow cytometry, radioligand binding assays, HPLC, and bioanalyzer. MicroPET/CT imaging showed a good tumor uptake of Zr-89-nimotuzumab-SpyTag- increment N-SpyCatcher with 6.0 +/- 0.6%IA/cc (n = 3) at 48 h post injection. The EC50 of Ac-225-nimotuzumab-SpyTag- increment N-SpyCatcher and Ac-225-control-IgG-SpyTag- increment N-SpyCatcher against an EGFR-positive cell-line (MDA-MB-468) was 3.7 +/- 3.3 Bq/mL (0.04 +/- 0.03 nM) and 18.5 +/- 4.4 Bq/mL (0.2 +/- 0.04 nM), respectively. In mice bearing MDA-MB-468 EGFR-positive xenografts, Ac-225-nimotuzumab-SpyTag- increment N-SpyCatcher significantly (p = 0.0017) prolonged the survival of mice (64 days) compared to Ac-225-control IgG (28.5 days), nimotuzumab (28.5 days), or PBS-treated mice (30 days). The results showed that the conjugation and labeling using SpyTag/ increment N-SpyCatcher to nimotuzumab did not significantly (p > 0. 05) alter the receptor binding of nimotuzumab compared with a non-specific conjugation approach. Ac-225-nimotuzumab-SpyTag- increment N-SpyCatcher was effective in vitro and in an EGFR-positive triple negative breast cancer xenograft model.

Various GRPR antagonists and agonists have been labeled with radiometals for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of GRPR-positive tumors. However, unfavorable hepatobiliary excretion such as high intestinal activity may prohibit their clinical utility for imaging abdominal cancer. In this study, the modified BBN peptide with a new hydrophilic linker was labeled with Ga-68 for PET imaging of GRPR-expressing PC-3 prostate cancer xenograft model. GRPR antagonists, MATBBN (Gly-Gly-Gly-Arg-Asp-Asn-d-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Leu-NHCH2CH3) and ATBBN (d-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Leu-NHCH2CH3), were conjugated with 1,4,7-triazacyclononanetriacetic acid (NOTA) and labeled with Ga-68. Partition coefficient and in vitro stability were also determined. GRPR binding affinity of both tracers was investigated by competitive radioligand binding assay. The in vivo receptor targeting potential and pharmacokinetic of Ga-68-NOTA-MATBBN were also evaluated in PC-3 prostate tumor model and compared with those of Ga-68-NOTA-ATBBN. NOTA-conjugated BBN analogs were labeled with Ga-68 within 20 min with a decay-corrected yield ranging from 90 to 95 % and a radiochemical purity of more than 98 %. The specific activity of Ga-68-NOTA-MATBBN and Ga-68-NOTA-ATBBN was at least 16.5 and 11.9 GBq/mu mol, respectively. The radiotracers were stable in phosphate-buffered saline and human serum. Ga-68-NOTA-MATBBN was more hydrophilic than Ga-68-NOTA-ATBBN, as indicated by their log P values (-2.73 +/- A 0.02 vs. -1.20 +/- A 0.03). The IC50 values of NOTA-ATBBN and NOTA-MATBBN were similar (102.7 +/- A 1.18 and 124.6 +/- A 1.21 nM). The accumulation of Ga-68-labeled GRPR antagonists in the subcutaneous PC-3 tumors could be visualized via small animal PET. The tumors were clearly visible, and the tumor uptakes of Ga-68-NOTA-MATBBN and Ga-68-NOTA-ATBBN were determined to be 4.19 +/- A 0.32, 4.00 +/- A 0.41, 2.93 +/- A 0.35 and 4.70 +/- A 0.40, 4.10 +/- A 0.30, 3.14 +/- A 0.30 %ID/g at 30, 60, and 120 min, respectively. There was considerable accumulation and retention of Ga-68-NOTA-ATBBN in the liver and intestines. In contrast, the abdominal area does not have much retention of Ga-68-NOTA-MATBBN. Biodistribution data were in accordance with the PET results, showing that Ga-68-NOTA-MATBBN had more favorable pharmacokinetics and higher tumor to background ratios than those of Ga-68-NOTA-ATBBN. At 1 h postinjection, the tumor to liver and intestine of Ga-68-NOTA-MATBBN were 8.05 +/- A 0.56 and 21.72 +/- A 3.47 and the corresponding values of unmodified counterpart were 0.85 +/- A 0.23 and 3.45 +/- A 0.43, respectively. GRPR binding specificity was demonstrated by reduced tumor uptake of radiolabeled tracers after coinjection of an excess of unlabeled BBN peptides. Ga-68-NOTA-MATBBN exhibited GRPR-targeting properties both in vitro and in vivo. The favorable characterizations of Ga-68-NOTA-MATBBN such as convenient synthesis, specific GRPR targeting, high tumor uptake, and satisfactory pharmacokinetics warrant its further investigation for clinical cancer imaging.

Studies of competitive binding with H-3-labelled 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC) and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) have shown that beta-NF is a high-affinity ligand for AhR and also for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-binding protein, both soluble proteins of rat liver in 8 S and 4 S fractions, respectively, of sucrose gradients. This study examined binding of [H-3]beta-NF to liver cytosolic proteins of female Sprague-Dawley rats. Treatment of rats with beta-NF, 3-MC, TCDD or alpha-naphthoflavone (alpha-NF) increased the specific [H-3]beta-NF binding to liver cytosol up to 125-fold that of vehicle (corn oil)-treated rats (< 100 fmol/mg of protein). Sucrose gradients revealed a large 4 S and a small 8 S peak of radioactivity from [H-3]beta-NF binding to cytosols of beta-NF-, 3-MC-, TCDD- or alpha-NF-treated rats. Whereas co-incubation with the unlabelled beta-NF eliminated both peaks, co-incubation with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran (TCDF) eliminated only the 8 S peak. The sucrose density gradient from [H-3]TCDD binding to cytosol of beta-NF- or TCDD-treated rats yielded a small 4 S and a larger 8 S peak; only the latter was abolished by coincubation with TCDF. Thus, the patterns of sedimentation, distribution and elimination of radioactivity from the 8 S fraction of the liver cytosols from beta-NF-, 3-MC-, TCDD- or alpha-NF-treated rats were characteristic for the AhR, whereas those from the 4 S fraction appeared specific for [H-3]beta-NF binding. The data indicate that potent AhR agonists, TCDD, 3-MC and beta-NF, and to a lesser extent alpha-NF, a weak AhR agonist, induce a 4 S [H-3]beta-NF-binding protein in liver cytosol of female rats. alpha-NF, beta-NF and 3-MC were effective competitors (80-85% inhibition) of the [H-3]beta-NF-specific binding to the beta-NF-, 3-MC- or TCDD-induced 4 S protein, whereas several PAHs including B[a]P and benzo[e]pyrene were only weak competitors. The increased [H-3]beta-NF binding was not associated with glycine N-methyltransferase activity. Hence, the 4 S [H-3]beta-NF-binding protein described herein differs from the constitutive 4 S PAM-binding protein of rat liver cytosols in the inducibility by beta-NF and 3-MC, ligand-binding characteristics, and lack of glycine N-methyltransferase activity. Gel filtration on Sephacryl of liver cytosols from beta-NF-treated rats indicated a molecular mass of approximate to 42 kDa for [H-3]beta-NF-bound protein and suggested that it was derived from a large mass component that before the radioligand binding was eluted with the void volume of the gel and sedimented in a 7 S fraction of the sucrose gradient. The [H-3]beta-NF binding activity was not eluted with glutathione S-transferase Ya, aldehyde-3-dehydrogenase or DT-diaphorase [NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase] activities, which are AhR-controlled and beta-NF-inducible.

[F-18]LW223, a newly reported TSPO PET tracer which was insensitive to rs6971 polymorphism, showed favorable performance characteristics in a recent im-aging study involving a rat myocardial infarction model. To enable quantitative neuroimaging with [F-18]LW223, we conducted kinetic analysis in the non-human primate (NHP) brain. Further, we sought to assess the utility of [F-18]LW223-based TSPO imaging in a first-in-human study. Methods: Radiosynthesis of [F-18]LW223 was accomplished on an automated module, whereas molar activities, stability in formulation, lipophilicity and unbound free fraction (fu) of the probe were measured. Brain pene-tration and target specificity of [F-18]LW223 in NHPs were corroborated by PET-MR imaging under baseline and pre-blocking conditions using the validated TSPO inhibitor, (R)-PK11195, at doses ranging from 5 to 10 mg/kg. Kinetic modeling was performed using one-tissue compartment model (1TCM), two-tissue compartment model (2TCM) and Logan graphical analyses, using dynamic PET data acquisition, arterial blood collection and metabolic stability testing. Clinical PET scans were performed in two healthy volunteers (HVs). Regional brain standard uptake value ratio (SUVr) was assessed for different time intervals. Results: [F-18]LW223 was synthesized in non-decay corrected radiochemical yields (n.d.c. RCYs) of 33.3 +/- 6.5% with molar activities ranging from 1.8 +/- 0.7 Ci/mu mol (n = 11). [F-18]LW223 was stable in formulation for up to 4 h and LogD7.4 of 2.31 +/- 0.13 (n = 6) and fu of 5.80 +/- 1.42% (n = 6) were determined. [F-18]LW223 exhibited good brain penetration in NHPs, with a peak SUV value of ca. 1.79 in the whole brain. Pre-treatment with (R)-PK11195 substantially accelerated the washout and attenuated the area under the time-activity curve, indicating in vivo specificity of [F-18]LW223 towards TSPO. Kinetic modeling demonstrated that 2TCM was the most suitable model for [F-18]LW223-based neuroimaging. Global transfer rate constants (K1) and total volumes of distribution (VT) were found to be 0.10 +/- 0.01 mL/cm(3)/min and 2.30 +/- 0.17 mL/cm3, respectively. Dynamic PET data analyses across distinct time windows revealed that the VT values were relatively stable after 60 min post-injection. In a preliminary clinical study with two healthy volunteers, [F-18]LW223 exhibited good brain uptake and considerable tracer retention across all analyzed brain regions. Of note, an excellent correlation between SUVr with VT was obtained when assessing the time interval from 20 to 40 min post tracer injection (SUVr(20-40 min), R-2 = 0.94, p < 0.0001), suggesting this time window may be suitable to estimate specific binding to TSPO in human brain. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that [F-18]LW223 is suitable for quantitative TSPO-targeted PET imaging in higher species. Employing state-of-the-art kinetic modeling, we found that [F-18]LW223 was effective in mapping TSPO throughout the NHP brain, with best model fits obtained from 2TCM and Logan graphical analyses. Overall, our results indicate that [F-18]LW223 exhibits favorable tracer performance characteristics in higher species, and this novel imaging tool may hold promise to provide effective neuroinflammation imaging in pa-tients with neurological disease.

However, the utility of spherical AuNPs for activatable fluorescence sensing of molecular processes have been confined to resonance-matched fluorophores in the 500 nm to 600 nm spectral range to maximize dye fluorescence quenching efficiency. Expanding the repertoire of fluorophore systems into the NIR fluorescence regimen with emission >800 nm will facilitate the analysis of multiple biological events with high detection sensitivity. Objective: The primary goal of this study is to determine if spherical AuNP-induced radiative rate suppression of non-resonant near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent probes can serve as a versatile nanoconstruct for highly sensi-tive detection and imaging of activated caspase-3 in aqueous media and cancer cells. This required the devel-opment of activatable NIR fluorescence sensors of caspase-3 designed to overcome the nonspecific degradation and release of the surface coatings in aqueous media. Methods: We harnessed the fluorescence-quenching properties and multivalency of spherical AuNPs to develop AuNP-templated activatable NIR fluorescent probes to detect activated caspase-3, an intracellular reporter of early cell death. Freshly AuNPs were coated with a multifunctional NIR fluorescent dye-labeled peptide (LS422) con-sisting of an RGD peptide sequence that targets alpha(v)beta(3)-integrin protein (alpha v33) on the surface of cancer cells to mediate the uptake and internalization of the sensors in tumor cells; a DEVD peptide sequence for reporting the induction of cell death through caspase-3 mediated NIR fluorescence enhancement; and a multidentate hexacysteine sequence for enhancing self-assembly and stabilizing the multifunctional construct on AuNPs. The integrin-binding affinity of LS422 and caspase-3 kinetics were determined by competitive radioligand binding and fluorogenic peptide assays, respectively. Detection of intracellular caspase-3, cell viability, and the internalization of LS422 in cancer cells was determined by confocal NIR fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy. Results: Narrow size AuNPs (13 nm) were prepared and characterized by transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. When assembled on the AuNPs, the binding constant of LS422 for alpha(v)beta(3) improved 11-fold from 13.2 nM to 1.2 nM. Whereas the catalytic turnover of caspase-3 by LS422-AuNPs was similar to the reference fluorogenic peptide, the binding affinity for the enzyme increased by a factor of 2. Unlike the alpha(v)beta(3) positive, but caspase-3 negative breast cancer MCF-7 cells, treatment of the alpha(v)beta(3) and caspase-3 positive lung cancer A549 cells with Paclitaxel showed significant fluorescence enhancement within 30 minutes, which cor-related with caspase-3 specific activation of LS422-AuNPs fluorescence. The incorporation of a 3.5 mW NIR laser source into our spectrofluorometer increased the detection sensitivity by an order of magnitude (limit of detection similar to 0.1 nM of cypate) and significantly decreased the signal noise relative to a xenon lamp. This gain in sensitivity enabled the detection of substrate hydrolysis at a broad range of inhibitor concentrations without photobleaching the cypate dye. Conclusion: The multifunctional AuNPs demonstrate the use of a non-resonant quenching strategy to design activatable NIR fluorescence molecular probes. The nanoconstruct offers a selective reporting method for de-tecting activated caspase-3, imaging of cell viability, identifying dying cells, and visualizing the functional status of intracellular enzymes. Performing these tasks with NIR fluorescent probes creates an opportunity to translate the in vitro and cellular analysis of enzymes into in vivo interrogation of their functional status using deep tissue penetrating NIR fluorescence analytical methods.

The vast majority of human tumors seem to overexpress the one or the other of five distinct hSSTR subtype receptors. Whereas neuroendocrine tumors frequently overexpress hSSTR2, intestinal adenocarcinomas seem to over-express more often hSSTR3 or hSSTR4, or both of these hSSTR. In contrast to In-111-DTPA-(D)Phe(1)-octreotide (OCTREOSCAN (R)) which binds to hSSTR2 and 5 with high affinity (K-d 0.1-5 nM), to hSSTR3 with moderate affinity (K-d 10-100 nM) and does not bind to hSSTR1 and hSSTR4, In-111/Y-90-DOTA-lanreotide was found to bind to hSSTR2, 3, 4, and 5 with high affinity, and to hSSTR1 with lower affinity (K-d 200 nM). Based on its unique hSSTR binding profile, In-111-DOTA-lanreotide was suggested to be a potential radioligand for tumor diagnosis, and Y-90-DOTA-lanreotide suitable for receptor-mediated radionuclide therapy. As opposed to In-111-DTPA-(D)Phe(1)-octreotide and In-111-DOTA-(D)Phe(1)-Tyr(3)-octreotide, discrepancies in the scintigraphic results were seen in about one third of (neuroendocrine) tumor patients concerning both the tumor uptake as well as detection of tumor lesions. On a molecular level, these discrepancies seem to be based on a "higher" high-affinity binding of In-111-DOTA-(D)Phe(1)-Tyr(3)-octreotide to hSSTR2. Other somatostatin analogs with divergent affinity to the five known hSSTR subtype receptors have also found their way into the clinics, including (99)mTc-HYNIC-octreotide or Tc-99m-depreotide (NEOSPECT (R) ;NEOTECT (R)). Most of the imaging results are reported for neuroendocrine tumors (octreotide analogs) or non small cell lung cancer (Tc-99m-depreotide), indicating high diagnostic capability of this type of receptor tracers. Consequently to their use as receptor imaging agents, hSSTR recognizing radioligands have also been implemented for experimental receptor-targeted radionuclide therapy. The study "MAURTTTUS" (Multicenter Analysis of a Universal Receptor imaging and Treatment Initiative, a eUropean Study), a Phase Pa study, showed in patients with a calculated tumor dose > 10 Gy/GBq Y-90-DOTA-lanreotide, the proof-of-principle for treating tumor patients with receptor imaging agents. Overall treatment results in > 60 patients indicated stable tumor disease in roughly 35% of patients and regressive disease in 15% of tumor patients with different tumor entities. No acute or chronic severe hematological toxicity, change in renal or liver function parameters due to Y-99-DOTA-lanreotide, was reported. In-90-DOTA-(D)Phe(1)-Tyr(3)-octreotide may show a higher tumor uptake in neuroendocrine tumor lesions and may therefore provide even better treatment results in tumor patients, but there is only limited excess to long-term and survival data at present. Besides newer approaches and recent developments of Re-188-labeled radioligands no clinical results on the treatment response is available yet. In conclusion, several radioligands have been implemented on the basis of peptide receptor recognition throughout the last decade. A plentitude of preclinical data and clinical studies confirm "proof-of-principle'' for their use in diagnosis as well as therapy of cancer patients, However, an optimal radiopeptide formulation does not yet exist for receptor-targeted radionuclide therapy.

It was previously shown that folate radioconjugates profit from modification with an albumin-binding moiety, which results in increased tumor uptake and reduced retention in the kidneys. In this study, the impact of the type of albumin binder and adjacent linker entity was systematically investigated. It was revealed that 4-(p-iodophenyl)butanoate binds to albumin with higher affinity than 5-(p-iodophenyl)pentanoate, and the presence of an adjacent hydrophobic 4-(aminomethyl)benzoic acid (AMBA) linker increased the binding in both cases even further. Stronger albumin-binding properties translated into enhanced blood residence of the respective folate radioconjugates, while the blood circulation time was found to be inversely linked to the radio-conjugates' renal accumulation. This study demonstrated that subtle changes in the albumin-binding entity and the adjacent linker unit can serve for fine-tuning the radioconjugates' tissue distribution profiles to find an optimum tumor uptake and a balance between retention in the blood and kidneys. Introducing an albumin-binding entity into otherwise short-lived radiopharmaceuticals can be an effective means to improve their pharmacokinetic properties due to enhanced blood residence time. In the current study, DOTA-derivatized albumin binders based on 4-(p-iodophenyl)butanoate (DOTA-ALB-1 and DOTA-ALB-3) and 5-(p-iodophenyl)pentanoate entities (DOTA-ALB-24 and DOTA-ALB-25) without and with a hydrophobic 4-(aminomethyl)benzoic acid (AMBA) linker unit, respectively, were synthesized and labeled with lutetium-177 for in vitro and in vivo comparison. Overall, [Lu-177]Lu-DOTA-ALB-1 demonstrated similar to 3-fold stronger in vitro albumin-binding affinity and a longer blood residence time (T-50% IA similar to 8 h) than [Lu-177]Lu-DOTA-ALB-24 (T-50%IA similar to 0.8 h). Introducing an AMBA linker enhanced the albumin-binding affinity, resulting in a T-50%IA of similar to 24 h for [Lu-177]Lu-DOTA-ALB-3 and similar to 2 h for [Lu-177]Lu-DOTA-ALB-25. The same albumin binders without or with the AMBA linker were incorporated into 6R- and 6S-5-methyltetrahydrofolate-based DOTA-conjugates (Lu-177-RedFols). Biodistribution studies in mice performed with both diastereoisomers of [Lu-177]Lu-RedFol-1 and [Lu-177]Lu-RedFol-3, which comprised the 4-(p-iodophenyl)butanoate moiety, demonstrated a slower accumulation in KB tumors than those of [Lu-177]Lu-RedFol-24 and [Lu-177]Lu-RedFol-25 with the 5-(p-iodophenyl)pentanoate entity. In all cases, the tumor uptake was high (30-45% IA/g) 24 h after injection. Both diastereoisomers of [Lu-177]Lu-RedFol-1 and [Lu-177]Lu-RedFol-3 demonstrated high blood retention (3.8-8.7% IA/g, 24 h p.i.) and a 2- to 4-fold lower kidney uptake than the corresponding diastereoisomers of [Lu-177]Lu-RedFol-24 and [Lu-177]Lu-RedFol-25, which were more rapidly cleared from the blood (<0.2% IA/g, 24 h after injection). Kidney retention of the 6S-diastereoisomers of all Lu-177-RedFols was consistently higher than that of the respective 6R-diastereoisomers, irrespective of the albumin binder and linker unit used. It was demonstrated that the blood clearance data obtained with Lu-177-DOTA-ALBs had predictive value for the blood retention times of the respective folate radioconjugates. The use of these albumin-binding entities without or with an AMBA linker may serve for fine-tuning the blood retention of folate radioconjugates and also other radiopharmaceuticals and, hence, optimize their tissue distribution profiles. Dosimetry estimations based on patient data obtained with one of the most promising folate radioconjugates will be crucial to identify the dose-limiting organ, which will allow for selecting the most suitable folate radioconjugate for therapeutic purposes.

Exploration of the impact of stereochemistry on the identification of the novel translocator protein PET imaging agent [<SUP>18</SUP>F]GE-180	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						[F-18]GE-180; PET radiotracer; Imaging TSPO; Chiral stability; In vitro and in vivo metabolites; Biodistribution	PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; 18 KDA TSPO; LIGANDS; STEROIDOGENESIS; RADIOTRACER	Introduction: The tricyclic indole compound,[F-18]GE-180 has been previously identified as a promising positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent of the translocator protein (TSPO) with the potential to aid in the diagnosis, prognosis and therapy monitoring of degenerative neuroinflammatory conditions such as multiple sclerosis. [F-18]GE-180 was first identified and evaluated as a racemate, but subsequent evaluations of the resolved enantiomers have shown that the S-enantiomer has a higher affinity for TSPO and an improved in vivo biodistribution performance, in terms of higher uptake in specific brain regions and good clearance (as described previously). Here we describe the additional biological evaluations carried out to confirm the improved performance of the S-enantiomer and including experiments which have demonstrated the stability of the chiral centre to chemical and biological factors. Materials and Methods: GE-180 and the corresponding radiolabelling precursor were separated into single enantiomers using semi-preparative chiral supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC). A detailed comparison of the individual enantiomers and the racemate was carried out in a number of biological studies. TSPO binding affinity was assessed using a radioligand binding assay. Incubation with rat hepatic S9 fractions was used to monitor metabolic stability. In vivo biodistribution studies up to 60 min post injection (PI) in nave rats were carried out to monitor uptake and clearance. Achiral and chiral in vivo metabolite detection methods were developed to assess the presence of metabolite/s in plasma and brain samples, with the chiral method also determining potential racemisation at the chiral centre. Results: Evaluation of the chiral stability of the two enantiomers to metabolism by rat S9 fractions, showed no racemisation of enantiomers. There were notable differences in the biodistribution between the racemate and the R- and S-enantiomers. All compounds had similar initial brain uptake between 0.99 and 1.01% injected dose (id) at 2 min PI, with S-[F-18]GE-180 showing significantly greater retention than the R-enantiomer at 10 and 30 min PI (P < 0.05). S-[F-18]GE-180 uptake to the TSPO-expressing olfactory bulbs was 0.45% id (SD +/- 0.17) at 30 min PI in comparison to RS-[F-18]GE-180 or R-[F-18]GE-180 levels of 0.41% id +/- 0.09 and 0.23% id +/- 0.02 respectively, at the same timepoint (P> 0.05). The signal-to-noise ratio (ratio olfactory bulb to striata binding) were similar for both RS-[18F]GE-180 and S-[F-18]GE-180 (3.2 and 3.4 respectively). Initial uptake to the lungs (an organ with high TSPO expression) was more than 3-fold greater with S-[F-18]GE-180 than R-[F-18]GE-180, and significantly higher at 10 and 30 min PI (P <0.05). Furthermore lung uptake of S-[F-18]GE-180 at 2 and 10 min PI was also significant when compared to the racemate (P < 0.05). The majority of the radioactivity in the rat brain following administration of RS-[F-18]GE-180 or S-[F-18]GE-180 was due to the presence of the parent compound (91% +/- 1.5 and 94% +/- 2.0 of total radioactivity at 60 min PI respectively). In contrast at 60 min PI for the plasma samples, the parent compounds accounted for only 28% +/- 1.2 and 21% +/- 4.6 of total radioactivity for RS-[F-18]GE-180 and S-[F-18]GE-180 respectively. Chiral assessment confirmed that the S-enantiomer was chirally stable in vivo, with no stereochemical conversion in brain and plasma samples up to 60 min Pl. Conclusions: Developing racemic radiotracers, as for racemic therapeutics, is a considerable challenge due to differences of the enantiomers in pharmacokinetics, efficacy and potential toxicity. We have shown that the enantiomers of the promising racemic PET ligand [18F]GE-180 do not share identical performance, with S-[18F]GE-180 demonstrating higher TSPO affinity, higher brain uptake and better retention to the high TSPO-expressing lungs. Furthermore, S-[F-18]GE-180 has also been shown to be enantiomerically stable in vivo, with no observed conversation of the eutomer to the distomer. As a single enantiomer,S-[F-18]GE-180 retains the beneficial characteristics of the racemate and is a promising imaging agent for imaging neuroinflammation in vivo. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The signals generated on adjacent brain sections by each probe were quantified and/or rated and were compared in order to identify neuronal populations expressing the receptor, In addition, the cellular localization of the transcripts within various brain structures was analyzed in sections dipped in a photographic emulsion. In the cerebral cortex, the strong mRN, expression in intermediate and deep layers indicates the presence of H-3, receptors on several types of neurons, The binding is dense except in layer V, suggesting that H-3 receptors are located on granule cells and apical dendrites of pyramidal cells. In addition to their localization on monoaminergic afferents, the dense binding in layer IV and strong mRNA expression in thalamic nuclei suggest the presence of heteroreceptors on thalamocortical projections, In the hippocampus. the strong mRNA expression but low binding in pyramidal layers of the CA1 and ventral CA3 fields suggest that H-3 receptors are abundant on efferent projections of pyramidal cells. In the dentate gyrus, some binding sites in the molecular layer may correspond to H-3 receptors synthesized in granule cells and coexpressed with H-1 and H-2 receptors in their dendrites. In the basal ganglia, H-3 receptors are highly expressed in the striatal complex and olfactory tubercles but not in islands of Calleja. Some of the striatal binding sites may correspond to presynaptic receptors present on afferents. The mRNAs in cortical layer V may encode for heteroreceptors on corticostriatal neurons. The presence of mRNAs in the substantia nigra pars compacta suggests that H-3 receptors are located upon nigrostriatal afferents. However, the absence of any signal in the ventral tegmental area indicates that some but not all dopaminergic neurons express H-3 receptors. In addition, the homogeneous mRNA expression within the caudate putamen and nucleus accumbens suggests that many striatal H-3 receptors are present on medium-sized, spiny projection neurons of both the direct and indirect movement pathways. In agreement, a dense binding. but low mRNA expression, is observed in external and internal pallidum and in substantia nigra pars reticulata. In the amygdala, the dense binding and mRNA expression indicate the presence of receptors on both afferents and projections. In the thalamus. the binding in some association nuclei may correspond to receptors present on neurons emanating from the deep cortical layers that strongly express the mRNAs, as well as receptors on the visual systems. However. the low binding and high mRNA expression in most nuclei indicate that many receptors are present upon thalamic projections. In the hypothalamus. the mRNA expression parallels the density of binding sites and is the highest in the tuberomammillary nucleus. Further investigation is needed to know if the dense binding and mRNA expression observed in other nuclei such as the para-ventricular, ventromedial and medial tuberal nuclei correspond to pre- and/or postsynaptic receptors. mRNAs are also observed in several areas projecting to the tuberomammillary nucleus, such as the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus. In the lower brainstem, the high mRNA expression and very low binding in the locus coeruleus and raphe nuclei indicate that presynaptic rather than somatodendritic receptors regulate noradrenaline and serotonin release, respectively. A similar pattern in vestibular nuclei suggests that receptors located on projections account for the anti-vertigo properties of H-3 receptor antagonists. In the cerebellum, binding is hardly detectable but a strong mRNA expression is found in most, if not all, Purkinje cells as well as in several central cerebellar nuclei, suggesting the presence of H-3 receptors on efferent projections. The present study reports the first detailed quantification and/or rating of H-3 receptor mRNAs in the brain. The comparison, performed in the same animals, with the distribution of the H-3, receptor protein provides evidence for the presence of H-3 receptors on many neuronal perikarya, dendrites and projections. Although some localizations, mainly as auto- or heteroreceptors. are consistent with previous functional studies. the physiological role. if any. of most of these presynaptic or postsynaptic receptors remains to be established, (C) 2002 IBRO.

Here, we report additional health-related quality of life (HRQOL), pain, and symptomatic skeletal event results. Methods This multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial was conducted at 84 cancer centres in nine countries in North America and Europe. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older; had progressive PSMA-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0-2; and had previously received of at least one androgen receptor pathway inhibitor and one or two taxanecontaining regimens. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either [(1)77Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 plus protocolpermitted standard of care ([(1)77Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 group) or standard of care alone (control group) using permuted blocks. Randomisation was stratified by baseline lactate dehydrogenase concentration, liver metastases, ECOG performance status, and androgen receptor pathway inhibitor inclusion in standard of care. Patients in the [(1)77Lu] Lu-PSMA-617 group received intravenous infusions of 7 center dot 4 gigabecquerel (GBq; 200 millicurie [mCi]) [(1)77Lu] Lu-PSMA-617 every 6 weeks for four cycles plus two optional additional cycles. Standard of care included approved hormonal treatments, bisphosphonates, and radiotherapy. The alternate primary endpoints were radiographic progression- free survival and overall survival, which have been reported. Here we report the key secondary endpoint of time to first symptomatic skeletal event, and other secondary endpoints of HRQOL assessed with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) and EQ-5D-5L, and pain assessed with the Brief Pain InventoryShort Form (BPI-SF). Patient-reported outcomes and symptomatic skeletal events were analysed in all patients who were randomly assigned after implementation of measures designed to reduce the dropout rate in the control group (on or after March 5, 2019), and safety was analysed according to treatment received in all patients who received at least one dose of treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03511664, and is active but not recruiting. Findings Between June 4, 2018, and Oct 23, 2019, 831 patients were enrolled, of whom 581 were randomly assigned to the [(1)77Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 group (n=385) or control group (n=196) on or after March 5, 2019, and were included in analyses of HRQOL, pain, and time to first symptomatic skeletal event. The median age of patients was 71 years (IQR 65-75) in the [(1)77Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 group and 72 center dot 0 years (66-76) in the control group. Median time to first symptomatic skeletal event or death was 11 center dot 5 months (95% CI 10 center dot 3-13 center dot 2) in the [(1)77Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 group and 6 center dot 8 months (5 center dot 2-8 center dot 5) in the control group (hazard ratio [HR] 0 center dot 50, 95% CI 0 center dot 40-0 center dot 62). Time to worsening was delayed in the [(1)77Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 group versus the control group for FACT-P score (HR 0 center dot 54, 0 center dot 45-0 center dot 66) and subdomains, BPI-SF pain intensity score (0 center dot 52, 0 center dot 42-0 center dot 63), and EQ-5D-5L utility score (0 center dot 65, 0 center dot 54-0 center dot 78). Grade 3 or 4 haematological adverse events included decreased haemoglobin (80 [15%] of 529 assessable patients who received [(1)77Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 plus standard of care vs 13 [6%] of 205 who received standard of care only), lymphocyte concentrations (269 [51%] vs 39 [19%]), and platelet counts (49 [9%] vs five [2%]). Treatment-related adverse events leading to death occurred in five (1%) patients who received [(1)77Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 plus standard of care (pancytopenia [n=2], bone marrow failure [n=1], subdural haematoma [n=1], and intracranial haemorrhage [n=1]) and no patients who received standard of care only. Interpretation [(1)77Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 plus standard of care delayed time to worsening in HRQOL and time to skeletal events compared with standard of care alone. These findings support the use of [(1)77Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 in patients with metastatic castration- resistant prostate cancer who received previous androgen receptor pathway inhibitor and taxane treatment.

J	Cano, A; Rocha, L; Briones, M; Villalobos, R				Cano, A; Rocha, L; Briones, M; Villalobos, R			Possible modulation of the morphine withdrawal effects by adenosine A<sub>1</sub> receptors	SALUD MENTAL			Spanish	Article						morphine withdrawal; rat brain; adenosine A(1) receptors	OPIATE WITHDRAWAL; MOUSE-BRAIN; GENE-EXPRESSION; BINDING; NALOXONE; DENSITY; ANTAGONISTS; ENKEPHALIN; DEPENDENCE; MECHANISMS	The opiate withdrawal syndrome has attracted the interest of scientists and society since realizing that in the 1880s the medically useful opiate drugs induce state of physiological and psychological dependency. Explanations for this syndrome of autonomic disturbance and psychic distress, which appears when drug intake ceases, have ranged from elaborate psychological and moral theories to increasing precise biochemical theories. New compounds, introduced partly for their lack of withdrawal effects, have included both heroin and methadone; now both are known for their withdrawal syndromes and substantial abuse. Nearly every treatment suspected to affect brain functions has been tried without significant success against the withdrawal syndrome, including electroconvulsive therapy, major and minor tranquilizers, insuline-induced hypoglycemic shock, and many others. Not a single opiate treatment so far has been convincingly proven effective, thus the problems of opiate dependency remain substantial for the individuals involved, and costly to society due to lost productivity, treatment delivery, and crime associated with drug supply and procurement. The scientific excitement about treatment for opiate withdrawal phenomena was increased by the discoveries that opiates act as receptors that are targets for numerous endogenous opiate-like peptide neurotransmitters. The research into the mechanisms of opiate action, tolerance and withdrawal suddenly appeared to offer insights into fundamental processes of central neural regulation and physiology. At the same time the increasing numbers of neurotransmitters, receptors, intracellular modulators, and interacting neuronal systems make more complex models and explanations necessary. At present, data suggest that every known neurotransmitters and neuroregulatory systems could be involved. Drug withdrawal is an integral part of most types of dependence and, to a large extent, opiate withdrawal has been considered the prototypical classical measure of opiate dependence. The opiate withdrawal syndrome is characterized by multiple behavioral and physiological signs such as behavioral activation, ptosis, diarrhea, wet dog shakes and motivational dysfunction, which may be represented in the central nervous system at multiple sites. Much recent evidence have been derived from studies of the nucleus locus coeruleus, the primary source of noradrenergic innervation of the limbic system, cerebral and cerebellar cortices, and a quantitatively smaller sources of innervation of hypothalamic and other brainstem nuclei. The locus coeruleus presents a noradrenergic inervation and is enriched with opioid receptors of the mu and kappa subtypes. In addition, it receives afferents from primary pain and sensory systems and sends efferents to many areas of the brain associates with specific physiological changes described during classical morphine withdrawal syndrome. Postsynaptic receptors for these efferents are the adrenoceptors subtypes, where noradrenaline release, in addition to some specific effects, seems to modulate other neurotransmitter inputs. The locus coeruleus appears to contain presynaptic receptors on the perikarya or dendrites, and on the nerve terminals that mediate modulatory responses. Receptors for substance P, muscarinic acethylcholine, and glutamate are excitatory, and inhibitory responses are seen following application of alpha-2 adrenoceptors, adenosine, GABA and benzodiazepine agonists, with evidence suggesting auto- and hetero-regulation, which involves the participation of efferents from the limbic system, cerebral cortex and hypothalamic innervation. The development of dependence with repeated use and the expression of withdrawal syndrome are characteristic features of all the opiates, represented by morphine. Although many studies regarding several neurotransmitters and receptors have been conducted to define the mechanisms involved in the development of dependence and expression of opiate withdrawal, these have not been fully clarified despite the huge accumulation of experimental and clinical data at present. The known mechanism associated to the presentation and termination of morphine withdrawal is important in the cases of dependence from voluntary administration, when withdrawal results of suppression of morphine administration in the pain treatment, as well as in the cases of neonatal abstinence, which leads to prolonged hospitalization for both mother and infant. Morphine is an opioid agonist with higher affinity by mu opioid receptors, however, many evidences indicate that other receptors, such as adenosine receptors, participate in the morphine effects. Opiate receptor-mediated adenylate cyclase signalling in the locus coeruleus is an important pathway in opiate dependence. Acutely administered opiate binds to opioid receptors and inhibits production of cyclic adenosin monophosphate (cAMP) by adenylate cyclase and decrease cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity. This results in the alteration of ion channels and the inhibitions of firing of locus coeruleus neurons. The continued presence of opiates and ongoing inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity may produce a compensatory enhancement of adenylate cyclase and PKA activity. Tolerance to opiates is associated with an increase in adenylate cyclase activity and the return of intracelular cAMP to baseline levels after two or three days of morphine treatment. Abrupt withdrawal of opiate after chronic administration produces adenylate cyclase hyperactivity associated with an acute flood of intracellular cAMP. Intravenous or intraventricular infusion of cAMP antagonizes morphine analgesia and accelerates the development of opiate tolerance and withdrawal syndrome. Complex regional alterations in adenylate cyclase and PKA activity and G protein subunities, after chronic morphine treatment, have been demonstrated in several brain regions. Adenosine receptors, like opioid receptors, play an important role in regulating neuronal adenylate cyclase activity and intracellular cAMP levels and can therefore affect opiate dependence. Adenosine A(1) receptor activation inhibits both adenylate cyclase activity and intracelular cAMPC formation, while A(2a) receptor activation stimulates both; these receptors ultimately affect PKA activity via cAMPC regulation. A variety of studies have suggested that adenosine receptors are involved in central opiate actions. On the other hand, the decrease of morphine withdrawal behavioral signs after a certain period of time, suggests endogenous changes that attenuate or terminate with morphine withdrawal. In rodents, the A(1) adenosine agonists blockade the morphine withdrawal signs apparition; which suggests the participation of A(1) receptors in the endogenous response related with attenuation of morphine withdrawal. Morphine withdrawal has been related with neural activity increased from locus coeruleus and many studies suggest the participation of other brain regions, such as limbic system and cerebral cortex. The main purpose of the present study was to known the endogenous changes in number (B-max) and affinity (K-d) of the adenosine A(1) receptors in five rat brain structures related with activity of the locus coeruleus when the morphine withdrawal has finished. Wistar male rats received six injections of morphine (20 mg/kg, i.p.), one each twenty four hours. The frequency of presentation of five morphine withdrawal behavioral signs (anxiety, pupillary dilatation, jumping, wet dog shakes and tremor), was recorded. Animals were sacrificed when the morphine withdrawal signs were observed in less that 10% of the population, and brain regions x ere dissected. In receptor binding studies by saturation assays with H-3-clorocyclopentil-adenosine (H-3-CCPA), a selective radioligand to adenosine A(1) receptors was used to obtain the corresponding B-max and K-d values from amygdala, cortex, striatum, hippocampus and hypothalamus membranes. Forty-eighth hours after the last morphine administration, the withdrawal signs were only present in 8% of the animals. At this time there was an increase in A(1) receptor number in the hippocampus (45%), the amygdala (12%), and the cerebral cortex (142%). No differences in the A(1), B-max and K-d-values were detected in the hypothalamus or the striatum in comparison with the control group. No significant changes were found in the affinity values in the hippocampus and amygdala; however, in the cortex the K-d values were higher (50%) than in the control group. Therefore, initial mu receptor activation results in adenosine A(1) receptor upregulation in brain cortex and limbic structures (hippocampus and amygdala), which arc associated with the decrease of morphine withdrawal signs. Simultaneously there are no changes in the hypothalamus and striatum. These results indicate that A(1) receptors of only certain cerebral structures participate in the morphine withdrawal regulation. The A(1) receptor upregulation found in the cortex and limbic system could be a endogenous response related with mu and A(1) receptor interaction that increases the ability of endogenous adenosine to decrease neural excitability to locus coeruleus in association to natural morphine withdrawal termination. The effects of endogenous adenosine on upregulated A(1) receptors in limbic and cortical afferent pathways could attenuate effects of opioid-mediated upregulation of adenylate cyclase and PKA which could decrease the neuronal firing rate in locus coeruleus in association with a decrease in the excitatory neurotransmitter release. Our results suggest that adenosine A(1) receptors represent an important site of therapeutic intervention in opiate dependence and in the treatment of withdrawal resulting when drug intake ceases.
