  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Strategies to improve the selection of appropriate
              target journals may reduce delays in disseminating research
              results. Machine learning is increasingly used in content-based
              recommender algorithms to guide journal submissions for academic
              articles. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the performance of
              open-source artificial intelligence to predict the impact factor
              or Eigenfactor score tertile using academic article abstracts.
              METHODS: PubMed-indexed articles published between 2016 and 2021
              were identified with the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms
              ``ophthalmology,'' ``radiology,'' and ``neurology.'' Journals,
              titles, abstracts, author lists, and MeSH terms were collected.
              Journal impact factor and Eigenfactor scores were sourced from
              the 2020 Clarivate Journal Citation Report. The journals included
              in the study were allocated percentile ranks based on impact
              factor and Eigenfactor scores, compared with other journals that
              released publications in the same year. All abstracts were
              preprocessed, which included the removal of the abstract
              structure, and combined with titles, authors, and MeSH terms as a
              single input. The input data underwent preprocessing with the
              inbuilt ktrain Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
              Transformers (BERT) preprocessing library before analysis with
              BERT. Before use for logistic regression and XGBoost models, the
              input data underwent punctuation removal, negation detection,
              stemming, and conversion into a term frequency-inverse document
              frequency array. Following this preprocessing, data were randomly
              split into training and testing data sets with a 3:1 train:test
              ratio. Models were developed to predict whether a given article
              would be published in a first, second, or third tertile journal
              (0-33rd centile, 34th-66th centile, or 67th-100th centile), as
              ranked either by impact factor or Eigenfactor score. BERT,
              XGBoost, and logistic regression models were developed on the
              training data set before evaluation on the hold-out test data
              set. The primary outcome was overall classification accuracy for
              the best-performing model in the prediction of accepting journal
              impact factor tertile. RESULTS: There were 10,813 articles from
              382 unique journals. The median impact factor and Eigenfactor
              score were 2.117 (IQR 1.102-2.622) and 0.00247 (IQR
              0.00105-0.03), respectively. The BERT model achieved the highest
              impact factor tertile classification accuracy of 75.0\%, followed
              by an accuracy of 71.6\% for XGBoost and 65.4\% for logistic
              regression. Similarly, BERT achieved the highest Eigenfactor
              score tertile classification accuracy of 73.6\%, followed by an
              accuracy of 71.8\% for XGBoost and 65.3\% for logistic
              regression. CONCLUSIONS: Open-source artificial intelligence can
              predict the impact factor and Eigenfactor score of accepting
              peer-reviewed journals. Further studies are required to examine
              the effect on publication success and the time-to-publication of
              such recommender systems.",

               factors and parts influencing the citation number of a scientific paper in the otology field. Therefore, this work
               proposes a new solution that utilizes machine learning and
               natural language processing to process English text and provides
               a paper citation as the predicted results. Different algorithms
               are implemented in this solution, such as linear regression,
               boosted decision tree, decision forest, and neural networks. The
               application of neural network regression revealed that papers'
               abstracts have more influence on the citation numbers of
               otological articles. This new solution has been developed in
               visual programming using Microsoft Azure machine learning at the
               back end and Programming Without Coding Technology at the front
               end. We recommend using machine learning models to improve the

We investigated this using provisional three-level REF2021 peer review scores for 84,966 articles submitted to the U.K. Research Excellence Framework 2021, matching a Scopus record 2014–18 and with a substantial abstract. We found that accuracy is highest in the medical and physical sciences Units of Assessment (UoAs) and economics, reaching 42\\% above the baseline (72\\% overall) in the best case. This is based on 1,000 bibliometric inputs and half of the articles used for training in each UoA. Prediction accuracies above the baseline for the social science, mathematics, engineering, arts, and humanities UoAs were much lower or close to zero. The Random Forest Classifier (standard or ordinal) and Extreme Gradient Boosting Classifier algorithms performed best from the 32 tested. Accuracy was lower if UoAs were merged or replaced by Scopus broad categories. We increased accuracy with an active learning strategy and by selecting articles with higher prediction probabilities, but this substantially reduced the number of scores predicted.}",

  abstract = { Worldwide scientific output is growing faster and faster. Academics should not only publish much and fast, but also publish research with impact.
  The aim of this study is to use machine learning to investigate characteristics of articles that were published in the Journal of Applied Physiology between 2009 and 2018,
  and characterize high-impact articles. Article impact was assessed for 4,531 publications by three common impact metrics: the Altmetric Attention Scores, downloads, and citations.
  Additionally, a broad collection of (more than 200) characteristics was collected from the article’s title, abstract, authors, keywords, publication, and article engagement.
  We constructed random forest (RF) regression models to predict article impact and articles with the highest impact (top-25\% and top-10\% for each impact metric),
  which were compared with a naive baseline method. RF models outperformed the baseline models when predicting the impact of unseen articles (P < 0.001 for each impact metric).
  Also, RF models predicted top-25\% and top-10\% high-impact articles with a high accuracy. Moreover, RF models revealed important article characteristics.
  Higher impact was observed for articles about exercise, training, performance and V̇o2max, reviews, human studies, articles from large collaborations,
  longer articles with many references and high engagement by scientists, practitioners and public or via news outlets and videos. Lower impact was shown for articles about respiratory physiology or sleep apnea,
  editorials, animal studies, and titles with a question mark or a reference to places or individuals. In summary,
  research impact can be predicted and better understood using a combination of article characteristics and machine learning.NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Common measures of article impact are the Altmetric Attention Scores,
  number of downloads, and number of citations. To our knowledge, this is the first study that applies machine learning on a comprehensive collection of article characteristics to predict article attention scores,
  downloads, and citations. Using 10 years of research articles, we obtained accurate predictions of high-impact articles and discovered important article characteristics related to article impact. }
