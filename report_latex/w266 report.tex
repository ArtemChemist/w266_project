\begin{abstract}
An impact score of the academic paper is a metric critically important for a scientist's career and attraction of funding for future research. The ability to predict the potential score of a paper could help scientists adjust their presentation strategy to achieve maximum impact. Natural language processing (NLP) is a logical tool to examine what leads to a scientific article's strong impact score because it allows one to analyze an articleâ€™s content numerically. In this paper we demonstarte the use of sciBERT with a combination of convolutional neural net to predict the impact factor of the paper based on it abstract.

\section{Introduction}
% Not done. Supppoesed to describe motivation for the work.
An impact score of the academic paper is a metric critically important for a scientist's career and attraction of funding for future research. The ability to predict the potential score of a paper could help scientists adjust their presentation strategy to achieve maximum impact. Our team aims to elucidate the factors that drive acceptance in high-impact journals. The main challenge of this task is that acceptance of a paper is a product of the interplay between the features of the paper and the journal. Statistically speaking, interaction terms in the model have relatively large weights and some interaction terms are likely non-linear.

\section*{Limitations}
While we are open to different types of limitations, just mentioning that a set of results have been shown for English only probably does not reflect what we expect. 
Mentioning that the method works mostly for languages with limited morphology, like English, is a much better alternative.
In addition, limitations such as low scalability to long text, the requirement of large GPU resources, or other things that inspire crucial further investigation are welcome.
